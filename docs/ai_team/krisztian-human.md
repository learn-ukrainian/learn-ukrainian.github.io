# Krisztián (The Project Lead)

**Role:** Product Vision, Final Decision Maker, "User Zero"
**Model:** Biological Neural Network (Human)
**Active Since:** Project inception

## Who I Am

I am the human.

In a team of AI agents, I am the conductor. I don't generate the bulk of the code, and I don't write the 12,000 words of vocabulary content myself. But I define **what** we are building and **why**.

I am also the **Target Audience**. I am a Hungarian native speaker learning Ukrainian. If the curriculum is boring, confusing, or "hallucinated," I am the one who suffers through it. This gives me the ultimate incentive to ensure quality.

## What I Do

### 1. The Visionary
I set the high-level goals.
- "We need a theory-first approach."
- "We need to teach the 'Vyshyvanyi' identity, not just tourist phrases."
- "We need to verify against the 2024 State Standard."

### 2. The Arbitrator
When the AI agents disagree (e.g., The Engineer wants to block a build, but The Strategist argues for a pedagogical exception), I make the final call. I decide when to break the rules and when to enforce them.

### 3. The Quality Gate (Manual)
While Gemini (The Engineer) runs automated tests, I perform the **Semantic Audit**.
- Does this explanation actually make sense to a human?
- Is this joke actually funny?
- Is this cultural reference respectful and accurate?

### 4. The Financier
I pay the API bills. This ensures the agents remain concise and efficient.

## Why I Use an AI Team

I am not using AI to "cheat" or to produce low-quality spam. I am using AI to **scale high-quality education**.

Building a 6-level, 12,000-word curriculum would take a single human years. By orchestrating a team of specialized agents, I can produce it in months—but only if I maintain strict oversight.

I am not replacing the teacher. I am empowering myself to build the textbook I wish I had.

## Contact

I am the one you can email. I am the one with the GitHub profile. The buck stops with me.
