# Research-First Workflow for Historical & Literary Tracks

> **Applies to:** `b2-hist`, `c1-bio`, `c1-hist`, `lit`, `oes`, `rut`
> **Purpose**: This workflow ensures high-quality content by requiring deep research BEFORE writing.

## The Problem (Solved)

Complex historical and literary modules were failing because:
1. **Wrong activity requirements** - Attempting to use drill-style activities for seminar-style content.
2. **No research phase** - Generating from memory instead of using corpus/primary source knowledge.
3. **Word count anxiety** - Trying to hit 3000-4000 words without sufficient factual substance.

## The Solution: Research-First Workflow

### Phase 0: Deep Research (BEFORE writing)

**Required steps:**
1. Search corpus for the figure - Ukrainian Wikipedia, academic sources
2. List all major life events, achievements, quotes, controversies
3. Find primary source quotes (their own words, contemporaries)
4. Identify connections to other Ukrainian figures (for cross-references)
5. Note specific dates, places, works, institutions

**Output**: Research notes with specific details to reference while writing.

### Phase 1: Structured Outline with Word Targets

Map research to required sections with word allocations:

| Section | Target Words | Content Focus |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Вступ | 300-500 | Hook, why this person matters, European/Ukrainian context |
| Життєпис | 1000-1500 | Chronological narrative with specific dates, places, events |
| Досягнення | 800-1000 | Major contributions, works, influence |
| Спадщина | 500-700 | Legacy, modern relevance, rehabilitation |
| Підсумок | 200-300 | Summary, key takeaways |

**Total**: 2800-4000 words

### Phase 2: Write with Research Notes Open

- Reference research as you write
- Include specific details (dates, places, quotes)
- Build authentic 4000+ words from real content
- Use engagement boxes (💡, 🇺🇦, 🌍) for cultural depth
- Include at least 1 primary source quote

### Phase 3: Activities (ONLY 4-9 needed!)

**Activity Requirements (Seminar Style):**
> **Applies to:** C1-BIO, C1-HIST, OES, RUTH, LIT (B2-HIST may vary)

- Min activities: **4**
- Max activities: **9**
- Items per activity: **1+**
- Required types: `reading`, `essay-response`, `critical-analysis`

**Typical activity set:**
1. `reading` - External reading assignment with linguistic analysis
2. `essay-response` - 250-400 word essay prompt (NO model answer)
3. `critical-analysis` - Deep analytical questions about sources/legacy
4. (Optional) `comparative-study` or `quiz`

### Phase 4: Audit and Fix

Run audit to verify:
- Word count: 4000+ (95%+ of target)
- Activities: 4-9 with required types
- Richness: 95%+ (engagement boxes, quotes, tables)
- Naturalness: 8/10+ Ukrainian quality

## Key Principles

1. **4000 words is achievable** - With proper research, you could write 10,000 words about these figures
2. **Use your corpus** - Ukrainian Wikipedia, school content, academic sources
3. **Specific details matter** - Dates, names, places make content authentic
4. **Activities are light** - Only 4-9 needed, not 96+
5. **Research first, write second** - Never generate from memory alone
