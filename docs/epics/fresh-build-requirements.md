# Fresh lesson-based build — requirements

> Sub-epic [#8397](https://github.com/learn-ukrainian/learn-ukrainian.github.io/issues/8397), parent #7994.
> Source: operator direction, 2026-09-21. Status: **draft for operator correction**. Once the
> operator accepts it, this file is the frozen input for the plan schema, the arcs, the plans and
> the build prompts. A later change to a requirement is made here first, then downstream.

## 1. What changes and what does not

**Changes.** `--upgrade` (preserve and expand an old module) is abandoned for A1–B2: it was
expensive and it misled — upgraded Module 1 shipped with a plan that said "first 7 letters" while
the content taught 33. "Curriculum upgrade" now means an **upgraded build engine** that creates
modules fresh from new plans. The largest visible change is the layout: a module is a sequence of
lessons.

**Does not change.** The methodology: decolonized pedagogy, Ukrainian State Standard 2024,
textbook and corpus grounding, VESUM and stress verification, student-aware immersion derived from
ULP, cross-family review, word targets as minimums, every audit gate passing.

## 2. Requirements

Each requirement has an id so plans, prompts, gates and reviews can cite it.

### Layout

- **R-01 Lessons.** A module is split into lessons of roughly one hour of learner time each.
- **R-02 No lesson cap.** A module has as many lessons as its content needs. Nobody pads a module
  to reach a count or squeezes one to stay under a count.
- **R-03 Recap close.** The last lesson of a module is a learner recap of *that* module. It is not a
  "Textbook Check", not a school-system explainer and not another presentation-practice-production
  cycle.
- **R-04 Targets per lesson.** Word targets are set per lesson and remain minimums.
- **R-05 Previous edition stays.** The earlier edition remains reachable (`/a1-v1/` today).

### Plans

- **R-06 Plan is the spine.** A module plan contains `lessons[]`. Each lesson states its job, its
  inventory (letters or sounds, grammar, vocabulary), its activities and its videos. The writer
  follows the plan; the writer does not invent the lesson structure.
- **R-07 Title equals job.** If a plan's title or subtitle disagrees with what its lessons teach,
  the plan is fixed before anything is written.
- **R-08 Plans are built with the sources MCP.** Teaching points, examples and sequencing are
  taken from pedagogy and knowledge that exists in our corpus (school textbooks, ULP, the
  dictionaries, the style guide, the State Standard), and each plan records where each point came
  from. Every Ukrainian word form, stress and morphological fact in a plan is tool-verified, never
  recalled from memory.
- **R-09 Full arc first.** A level's arc (module order, one-sentence job per module, progression of
  letters, grammar and vocabulary) is written and reviewed before its module plans.

### Build engine

- **R-10 Create, never upgrade.** The engine builds from the plan, the wiki and the MCP.
- **R-11 No context poisoning.** Old builds and old plans are never given to the writer or to the
  engine. The arc author may mine old plans for textbook citations only, and re-verifies each one
  through the MCP before using it.
- **R-12 No hand edits.** `module.md` and its siblings are produced by the engine. A defect is fixed
  in the plan, prompt, gate or code that caused it.
- **R-13 Fast tools.** The sources MCP must support heavy batch use: many words per call, compact
  responses, one "word card" call for morphology + stress + level + meaning (#8398). VESUM alone is
  not enough; ULIF data and the Atlas dictionary are part of the evidence base.

- **R-22 Stress is per form.** Each inflected form of a Ukrainian word may carry a different
  stress (`рука́`, `ру́ку`; `руки́` genitive singular vs `ру́ки` plural). Plans, word cards, gates
  and lessons treat stress at word-form grain, keyed by the form's grammatical tags — never one
  stress per lemma.

### Language and immersion

- **R-14 A1 immerses gradually.** English scaffolding in A1 is by design and recedes lesson by
  lesson, student-aware: the learner has completed every lesson before this one.
- **R-15 A2 is Ukrainian.** A2 is fully Ukrainian with occasional English support. From A2 the
  English share is never raised.
- **R-16 Simple Ukrainian.** In A1 and A2 the Ukrainian itself is very simple and fits the level of
  the learner that the specific lesson is aimed at — vocabulary and grammar the learner has met, plus
  what this lesson introduces.

### Learner experience

- **R-17 Exercise-rich.** Lessons carry many activities, inline and in the workbook tab.
- **R-18 Video.** A lesson includes YouTube video where a suitable one exists; the plan names it.
  No video is invented or guessed; a lesson without a suitable video simply has none.
- **R-19 Engaging activities.** Activities must be pleasant to use. **Quiz** and
  **find-and-fix-the-error** are the models. Today's **true-false** and **fill-in-the-blank** are
  the examples of a dull experience. Whether each is redesigned or retired is decided by a
  cross-family design discussion, because it changes `docs/best-practices/activity-pedagogy.md`,
  the activity schemas and the site components.

### Scope and order

- **R-20 Levels.** A1 first, then A2, B1, B2, using the same schema, engine and workflow.
- **R-21 Wiki and workflow.** Plans, the wiki and the build workflow are all improved as part of
  this work, not only the prompts.

### Pipeline (accepted by the operator 2026-09-21)

- **R-24 Build order.** Arc → module **plan** with `lessons[]` → **evidence pack** → module
  structure (landing, lesson skeletons, learner state per lesson) → lessons, one writer call per
  lesson → recap lesson, written last from the module's actual lessons → gates → cross-family
  review → publish.
- **R-25 Evidence pack replaces the wiki essay as pipeline input.** One pack per module, built
  with the sources MCP, then frozen and hashed. It is structured data, not prose: per teaching
  point, verbatim textbook quotes with chunk ids, model exercises from the textbooks, example
  sentences, known learner errors, verified word records with form-grain stress, videos. The
  reasoning the old wiki carried (why this order, what English speakers get wrong) lives in the
  plan as a short rationale per lesson. A human-readable wiki page may be rendered from the pack;
  it is not an input.
- **R-26 The writer does not search.** A lesson writer receives that lesson's plan entry, that
  lesson's evidence, and the learner state "completed lessons 1..n−1". The MCP is used after the
  draft, for verification.
- **R-27 Lesson shape follows the textbooks.** Theory in small steps, each followed by practice,
  then a larger practice block — the exercise density of the school textbooks in the corpus.
- **R-28 Coverage is deterministic.** Every evidence id a lesson plan lists must be used and cited
  in that lesson. This replaces the LLM wiki-coverage judge and its correction loops.
- **R-29 Seminars later.** The same structure will reshape seminar modules; that is out of scope
  until A1 is done.

### Immersion and pedagogy (carried over unchanged)

- **R-30 Keep the immersion settings that worked.** The live policy in `scripts/config.py`
  (`IMMERSION_POLICIES`, `USE_ULP_IMMERSION_DERIVATION = True`) is carried into the new build as
  is: A1 is ULP-derived and student-aware with a 40–55 % Ukrainian advisory share and structural
  targets that tighten through the level; A2 runs 75–100 % at the bridge, 85–100 % through the
  ramp and first 20 modules, 90–100 % to module 50 and 95–100 % to the end, with a little English
  support. B1 onward is full immersion. Nobody re-tunes these numbers as part of this epic.
- **R-32 The State Standard is a minimum, ULP is the schedule.** Every A1–B2 requirement of the
  State Standard 2024 must be covered at its level. Teaching something earlier than the Standard
  places it is allowed when ULP does so at the matching point of its course; the arc records the
  ULP evidence. Gates and reviews treat the Standard as a floor, not a ceiling.
- **R-31 ULP / Anna Ohoiko pedagogy is the model.** `docs/best-practices/ulp-presentation-pattern.md`
  (her seven practices and the S1→S6 progression) and the 2026-05-13 immersion decision stay
  binding for plans, evidence packs and lessons.
- **Design note for the schema child.** The bands are keyed by *module number* today. With lessons,
  and an arc that may renumber modules, the key has to become the learner's position in the
  course (cumulative lessons and vocabulary), not a module index — otherwise a renamed or split
  module silently changes its immersion band.

### Sequencing

- **R-23 Planning does not wait; implementation waits for data.** Atlas and the ULIF intake are a
  parallel project and the ULIF intake is slow. Curriculum planning (requirements, plan schema,
  arcs, module and lesson plans for every level) proceeds now. Module builds start only when the
  data base is ready for that level ("base ready for A1" is defined on #8400). Plan fields that
  need form-grain stress or a word card are marked pending and filled from the base when it lands;
  nothing is filled from memory in the meantime.

## 3. Roles

Design and planning sit with the curriculum-upgrade driver seat. Other fleet agents implement from
the driver's briefs. Ukrainian language questions are settled by the sanctioned language lanes.
Every review of record is cross-family at the exact head.

## 4. Open questions for the operator

The operator said some things were probably left unsaid. These are the gaps the driver can see;
each has a proposed default that applies unless corrected.

| # | Question | Proposed default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | What counts toward "one hour" — reading, videos, inline activities, workbook? | All learner time in the lesson page, workbook included. The plan estimates it; a gate checks the word and activity minimums, not a clock. |
| Q2 | Does each lesson keep the four tabs (Урок · Словник · Вправи · Ресурси)? | Yes, per lesson; the module landing aggregates. |
| Q3 | Is the learner state tracked per lesson rather than per module? | Yes — "has completed lessons 1..n−1" at lesson grain, including vocabulary met. |
| Q4 | May the new arc rename, split, merge or reorder the 55 A1 modules? | Yes, where the arc review agrees; slugs of published `/a1-v1/` pages do not change. |
| Q5 | Checkpoint modules: keep them, and do they follow the same lesson layout? | Keep; a checkpoint is lessons of mixed review and a self-check, no new material. |
| Q6 | Which video sources are acceptable? | Channels already in the corpus first (ULP and the others in `data/external_articles/`); anything else needs a recorded reason. Link rot is checked by a gate. |
| Q7 | Should vocabulary cards link to the Atlas dictionary entry for the word? | Yes once the Atlas entry exists; until then the card stands alone. |
| Q8 | Should lessons feed spaced review (practice decks) across lessons and modules? | Yes as a later child; the plan schema reserves the field now. |
| Q9 | Audio: is recorded or synthesized pronunciation in scope for A1? | Out of scope here; videos carry pronunciation. Revisit after A1. |
| Q10 | What does "better wiki" mean concretely? | One wiki packet per module that the plan cites, regenerated from the corpus with the same verification rules as plans. To be specified in its own child. |
| Q11 | When A2 is rebuilt, is the current A2 archived like A1 (`/a2-v1/`)? | Yes, same pattern. |

## 5. What "done" means for this document

The operator has read it, corrected it, and the corrected version is merged. Requirements added
later get the next free id; ids are never reused.
