   21.4 Present Tense of Verbs (Бути)  

          
  

In this module, you will learn when and how to use the verb **бу́ти** (to be), which also belongs to the first conjugation, in the infinitive and in the present tense.

## Завда́ння 1

Mark all the verbs in the dialogue below between two people vacationing in the Carpathian Mountains. Then answer the questions that follow.

## Цікаво!

The verb **бу́ти**, when conjugated, takes the hard-vowel endings of the first conjugation, like the verbs **писа́ти** and **жи́ти** (**я бу́ду**&#8230;). However, the conjugated forms of this verb have future meaning. In the present tense, this verb only has one form, **є**. **Є** is used in all persons and is equivalent to the English “am,” “is,” or “are.” For example:

**Тут є моро́зиво?** (**Is** there ice-cream here?)

**Там є смачні́ торти́.** (There **are** tasty cakes there.)

Most often in the present tense, however, **є** is not used but rather implied, as in the second line of the dialogue above, or in the following examples:

**– Де ви?** (Where **are** you?)

**– Ми в кіно́.** (We **are** at the movies.)

**Є** is only required in sentences about the existence of something, or what are “there is”/“there are” sentences in English. For example:

**В університе́ті є бібліоте́ка.** (There **is** a library at the university.)

**Тут є чоти́ри ба́нки.** (There **are** four banks here.)

## Завда́ння 2

Complete the short exchanges below using the words from the bank.

## Цікаво!

**Є **is often used with the construction **в**/**у** + noun/pronoun in the genitive case. Such sentences express possession – but when translated literally, they are still about existence. Hence, the use of **є**. For example:

**У ме́не є брат.** (*Literally:* By me there **is** a brother. = I have a brother.)

**В ма́ми є два комп****’****ю́тери.** (*Literally:* By mom there **are** two computers. = Mom has two computers.)

As [Module 21.1](https://opentext.ku.edu/dobraforma/chapter/21-1/) showed, Ukrainian also has a regular verb that expresses possession – **ма́ти**. Sentences with the above construction and those with **ма́ти** are identical in meaning:

**У ме́не є цуценя́. **= Я ма́ю цуценя́.

**В та́та є вели́кий рюкза́к? **= **Та́то ма́є вели́кий рюкза́к?**

Note, however, that there can be contexts in which **є** is not required with the **в**/**у **construction of possession. Compare the question above with the following one, which is about the *size *of a backpack rather than its existence:

**– В та́та вели́кий рюкза́к? – Ні, мале́нький.**

See [Module 7.1](https://opentext.ku.edu/dobraforma/chapter/7-1/) for the **в**/**у **construction of possession with nouns and [Module 13.3](https://opentext.ku.edu/dobraforma/chapter/13-3/) for the same construction with pronouns.

## Завда́ння 3

Provide the appropriate captions for the pictures below.

## Важли́во!

Unlike with other verbs, to negate **є**, you need to use the form **нема́є** (or **нема**́ in less formal situations). For example:

– Тут є туале́т?

**– Ви́бачте, нема́є. **(Or: **Нема́.**)

## Завда́ння 4

Select the most appropriate response to each of the questions below.

Transcript – Завдання 4

- Оленко, у тебе є ручка?

- Скажіть, будь ласка, тут є аптека?

- У вас є домашні тварини?

- Скажіть, будь ласка, де тут туалет?

- У Василя є дівчина?

- У вас є холодна кава?

## Важли́во!

In sentences that identify, define, or describe someone or something, **є** is implied rather than used explicitly:

**Я студе́нтка. **(I **am** a student.)

**Мої́ батьки́ – інжене́ри.** (My parents **are** engineers.)

Note how in the last sentence above, **є** is replaced with a dash. The dash is used when the subject of the sentence expressed by a *noun* (**батьки́**) is defined or described by means of another noun (**інжене́ри**). It is not used if one of these elements is a pronoun or an adjective, as in **Я студе́нтка**.

## Завда́ння 5

Write  down exactly what you hear below, including all punctuation.  When using the dash (–),  be sure to leave one space on either side of the dash.
