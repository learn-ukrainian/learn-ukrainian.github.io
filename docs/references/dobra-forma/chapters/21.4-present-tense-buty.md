# 21.4 Present Tense of Verbs (Бути)

## Overview
This module teaches the present tense conjugation of **бути** (to be), a first conjugation verb used specifically in Ukrainian.

## Key Concepts

### Present Tense Form
The verb бути has a single present tense form: **є** (is/are). It applies uniformly across all persons and numbers, unlike English which distinguishes "am," "is," and "are."

### When є is Used
**є** appears primarily in existence statements and "there is/are" constructions:
- "Тут є морозиво?" (Is there ice cream here?)
- "Там є смачні торти." (There are tasty cakes there.)

### When є is Omitted
In many sentences, particularly those expressing location or identity, **є** remains implicit:
- "– Де ви? – Ми в кіно." (Where are you? We're at the movies.)
- "Я студентка." (I am a student.)

### Possession Construction
The form combines with в/у + genitive case to express "have":
- "У мене є брат." (Literally: By me there is a brother = I have a brother.)
- This construction parallels the regular verb "мати" (to have).

### Negation
To negate **є**, use **немає** (more formal) or **нема** (informal):
- "– Тут є туалет? – Вибачте, немає." (Is there a restroom? Excuse me, no.)

### Dash Usage
A dash replaces **є** when both subject and predicate are nouns:
- "Мої батьки – інженери." (My parents are engineers.)

## Activities
The module includes five exercises: dialogue analysis, fill-in-the-blank exchanges, picture captioning, audio response selection, and dictation practice, culminating in a comprehensive test.
