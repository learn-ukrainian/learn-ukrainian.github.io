			13.2 Personal Pronouns (Accusative and Genitive Cases)		

										
		

In this module, you will work with accusative and genitive case forms of personal pronouns, which happen to be identical. You will become familiar with their use in various contexts, particularly as direct objects in questions as well as affirmative and negative sentences.

## Завда́ння 1

Read the captions below the images and note how the direct object nouns get replaced with personal pronouns in the accusative case. Note also that the gender of the pronoun depends on the grammatical gender of the noun it replaces.

Я люблю́** борщ**. Я ча́сто готу́ю **його́** взи́мку.

Ми лю́бимо** ка́ву**. Ми за́вжди п’є́мо **її́** вра́нці.

Оле́нка лю́бить **моро****́****зиво**. Вона́ ча́сто їсть **його****́ **влі́тку.

Select the correct pronouns to complete the sentences below and then answer the questions that follow.

## Завда́ння 2

Caption the images below, paying careful attention to context in making your choice.

## Цікаво!

As the sentences in the two exercises above illustrate, the direct object personal pronoun can appear either before or after the verb in the sentence. For example:

Він зна́є її́.

**Він її́ зна́є.**

There is only a slight difference in emphasis between these two sentences. The basic principle is that the new or more important information in the sentence comes last. Thus, the first sentence emphasizes that he knows *her* and the second one underscores that he *knows* her.

## Завда́ння 3

Use the pronouns provided in the bank to complete the conversation between two friends connecting via Skype.

## Завда́ння 4

Caption the images below, paying careful attention to context in making your choice.  Note how the personal pronouns in the accusative do NOT change their forms in sentences with negation, even though the use of genitive case is required after the negated verb (see [Module 5.2](https://dobraforma.ku.edu/nouns/5-2-inanimate-nouns-as-direct-objects-accusative-and-genitive-cases/)). This is because the personal pronoun forms in accusative and genitive are identical.
