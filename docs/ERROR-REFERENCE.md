# Error Reference

This document lists common errors encountered during curriculum audits and reviews, along with their meanings and suggested fixes.

## Audit Errors (AUDxxx)

These errors are generated by the automated audit script (`scripts/audit_module.py`).

| Code | Error Message | Meaning | Fix Suggestion |
|------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **AUD001** | Word count under target | The module content is shorter than the `word_target` specified in the meta file. | Expand the explanations, add more examples, or develop existing sections. |
| **AUD002** | Missing outline sections | One or more sections specified in the `content_outline` of the meta file are missing from the Markdown. | Add the missing `##` headers to the Markdown file. |
| **AUD003** | Missing required activity types | The activities generated do not match the `activity_hints` in the meta file. | Generate the missing activity types in `activities.yaml`. |
| **AUD004** | Naturalness score too low | The Ukrainian text sounds robotic or unnatural (score < 8.0). | Rewrite problematic sections to sound more native; avoid direct translations. |
| **AUD005** | YAML schema violation | The activity or meta YAML file does not match the expected structure. | Check the file against the schema in the `schemas/` directory. |
| **AUD006** | Russianism/Calque detected | A common Russianism or direct translation from Russian was found. | Replace the offending phrase with the correct Ukrainian equivalent. |
| **AUD007** | Invalid activity type | An activity type was used that is not supported for the current level. | Change the activity type to one listed in `docs/SCHEMA-REFERENCE.md`. |
| **AUD008** | Vocabulary count low | The number of vocabulary items is below the level minimum. | Add more relevant words or phrases to the vocabulary section. |
| **AUD009** | Sentence complexity high | A sentence exceeds the maximum word count allowed for the level. | Break the sentence into shorter, simpler ones. |
| **AUD010** | Agreement/Case error | A noun-adjective agreement or prepositional case error was detected. | Correct the gender or case ending to match Ukrainian grammar rules. |
| **AUD011** | Low Ukrainian content | An activity contains too little Ukrainian text compared to English. | Add more Ukrainian sentences, examples, or vocabulary to the activity. |
| **AUD012** | Immersion out of range | The ratio of Ukrainian to English text is outside the allowed range for the level. | Add more Ukrainian explanations if too low, or more English scaffolding if too high. |
| **AUD013** | Richness score low | The module lacks pedagogical richness (examples, dialogues, engagement boxes). | Add more diverse content elements like dialogues, callouts, and examples. |
| **AUD014** | Pedagogical violation | A core pedagogical requirement (e.g., PPP/TTT stage ordering) was violated. | Reorder activities or adjust explanations to follow the required teaching model. |
| **AUD015** | Grammar validation failed | Automated grammar validation detected potential errors or forbidden structures. | Review the flagged sentences and correct the grammar to match level constraints. |
| **AUD016** | Activity quality low | Interactive activities do not meet semantic quality standards (distractors, variety). | Improve the quality of wrong options and vary the activity structures. |

## Review Errors (REVxxx)

These errors are generated during manual or AI-assisted deep reviews (Phase 5).

| Code | Error Message | Meaning | Fix Suggestion |
|------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **REV001** | Pedagogical inconsistency | The teaching sequence or explanation logic is flawed. | Reorganize the content to follow a clearer scaffolding path (e.g., PPP). |
| **REV002** | Linguistic inaccuracy | A grammatical explanation or translation is factually incorrect. | Verify with the State Standard or a native speaker and correct the error. |
| **REV003** | Tone mismatch | The tone is too formal, too informal, or otherwise inappropriate for the level. | Adjust the language to match the intended persona (e.g., encouraging tutor). |
| **REV004** | Experience quality fail | The lesson fails the "Would I Continue?" test for engagement. | Add hooks, better transitions, or more engaging cultural context. |
| **REV005** | Propaganda/Bias detected | The content contains biased or propagandistic historical/cultural claims. | Rewrite the section to ensure balanced, fact-based historical analysis. |

## Technical Errors (TECxxx)

Errors related to the build pipeline or system environment.

| Code | Error Message | Meaning | Fix Suggestion |
|------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **TEC001** | MDX generation failed | The Markdown could not be converted to MDX. | Check for syntax errors in the Markdown or YAML frontmatter. |
| **TEC002** | Broker timeout | An inter-agent message took too long to process. | Retry the operation or check the status of the background agent. |
| **TEC003** | Missing sidecar file | A required `.yaml` file (meta, activities, or vocab) is missing. | Ensure all sidecar files are present in their respective directories. |
