## Recommendations

- **B2 History Gap**: ULP has limited content on specific historical periods (Trypillian, Scythians). Alternative resources (YouTube/Articles) are needed for M71-M131.
- **C1/C2 Content**: No modules currently exist for C1/C2. Once created, Season 5/6 episodes should be mapped.
- **FMU Integration**: FMU episodes are excellent for A1/A2 quick reviews and should be prioritized for mobile-friendly practice.
