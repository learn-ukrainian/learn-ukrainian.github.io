# Hallucinated & Suspicious Proverbs Audit

This report lists "proverbs", "sayings", or "folk wisdom" found in the curriculum that appear to be:
1.  **AI Hallucinations:** Invented phrases that sound authoritative but have no basis in real Ukrainian folklore.
2.  **Pedagogical Fabrications:** Phrases created to teach a specific grammar rule but presented as "ancient wisdom".
3.  **Misattributed Slogans:** Modern slogans or literary quotes presented as "folk proverbs".
4.  **Suspicious Modifications:** Real proverbs altered to fit a lesson theme (e.g., changing "tongue" to "language").

## 🚨 High Confidence Hallucinations / Fabrications

### 1. "Without rules, language isn't language"
*   **File:** `curriculum/l2-uk-en/b1/03-reading-grammar-rules.md`
*   **Text:** `Ukrainians have a proverb: **«Без правил і мова — не мова.»** — «Without rules, even language isn't language.»`
*   **Issue:** Highly suspicious. Sounds purely pedagogical to justify learning grammar rules. Likely invented by AI.

### 2. "Who knows the language goes everywhere"
*   **File:** `curriculum/l2-uk-en/b1/05-ready-for-immersion.md`
*   **Text:** `Ukrainians have a proverb: **«Хто мову знає, той усюди буває.»** — "Whoever knows the language, goes everywhere."`
*   **Issue:** This appears to be a clumsy modification of the real proverb **«Язик до Києва доведе»** (Your tongue will lead you to Kyiv) or **«Хто питає, той не блудить»**. The rhyming `знає/буває` is a common hallmark of AI trying to generate "proverb-like" structures.

### 3. "Grammar confirms rules" (Meta-commentary)
*   **File:** `curriculum/l2-uk-en/b2/42-aspect-nuances-imperative-infinitive.md`
*   **Text:** `> Зверніть увагу: народна мудрість підтверджує граматичні правила!`
*   **Issue:** While not a proverb itself, this claims that folklore *exists to confirm grammar*, which is a backward rationalization often found in AI content.

## ⚠️ Misattributed Slogans & Modern Phrases

### 4. "Speak Ukrainian, Think Ukrainian"
*   **File:** `curriculum/l2-uk-en/b2/37-word-formation-adverbs-integration.md`
*   **Text:** `> 🗣️ **Народна мудрість**`
    `> "Говори українською — думай по-українськи."`
*   **Issue:** This is a modern patriotic slogan or pedagogical motto, NOT "folk wisdom" (народна мудрість). Attributing it to folklore is anachronistic and incorrect.

### 5. "Where there is law, there is strength"
*   **File:** `curriculum/l2-uk-en/b2/27-law-justice-vocabulary.md`
*   **Text:** `> Українці кажуть: **«Де закон, там і сила»**.`
*   **Issue:** This sounds like a modern pro-rule-of-law inversion. Historical Ukrainian proverbs often express distrust of the law (e.g., **«Де закон, там і кривда»** - Where there is law, there is injustice; or **«Закон — як дишло...»**). This needs verification as it might be a "sanitized" or invented version.

## 🔎 Suspicious / Needs Verification

### 6. "Call the cow whatever..."
*   **File:** `curriculum/l2-uk-en/b2/36-word-formation-adjective-formation.md`
*   **Text:** `> Українська приказка каже: "Як корову обзивай, аби молоко давала."`
*   **Issue:** This sounds like a variation of **«Хоч горщиком назви, тільки в піч не став»**. The "cow" version might be regional or an AI variation. The explanation ("adjective doesn't reflect essence") is also suspiciously specific to the grammar topic.

### 7. "Without action, strength weakens"
*   **File:** `curriculum/l2-uk-en/b1/02-language-about-verbs.md`
*   **Text:** `Ukrainians have a proverb: **«Без діла слабіє сила.»**`
*   **Issue:** Plausible but generic. Could be a variation of **«Без діла жити — тільки небо коптити»** or **«Де немає діла, там і сила мліє»**. Needs checking if this exact phrasing exists.

## ✅ Verified Real Proverbs (For Context)
*These were found in the scan but appear authentic:*
*   "Сім разів відміряй, один раз відріж" (Measure 7 times...)
*   "Очі бояться, а руки роблять" (Eyes fear, hands do)
*   "Тихіше їдеш — далі будеш" (Slower you go, further you get)
*   "Зробив діло — гуляй сміло" (Did the deed, walk boldly)
*   "Вода камінь точить" (Water wears away stone)
*   "Слово — не горобець..." (Word is not a sparrow)
*   "Якби знав, де впадеш..." (If I knew where I'd fall...)

## Recommendation
Review the **High Confidence** and **Misattributed** items. For the AI hallucinations, replace them with:
1.  **Real proverbs** that roughly fit the theme (even if less perfect grammatically).
2.  **Literary quotes** (attributed correctly to authors like Shevchenko, Franko, etc.).
3.  **Remove the "Folk Wisdom" label** and present them as "Mottos" or "Sayings" if the phrase itself is useful (like "Speak Ukrainian, Think Ukrainian").
