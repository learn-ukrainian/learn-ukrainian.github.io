# Literature Expansion Strategy: "The National Corpus"

**Status**: Proposal (Professor Persona)
**Date**: Feb 10, 2026
**Relation**: Expands `LIT` into `LIT-MAIN` and `LIT-SPEC`. Integrates with `OES` & `RUTH`.

## 🏛 The Architectural Philosophy

We reject the "Survey Course" approach (shallow coverage). To defeat colonial narratives, we must demonstrate the **density, continuity, and stylistic diversity** of Ukrainian literature.

We adopt a **Two-Stream Architecture**:

1.  **LIT-MAIN (The Canon)**: The mandatory chronological spine. Cultural Literacy.
2.  **LIT-SPEC (The Library)**: Elective tracks for genre deep-dives and specific reading goals.

## 📜 Stream 1: LIT-MAIN (The Modern Canon)
*Period: 1798 – Present*

This stream is the direct continuation of **RUTH** (which ends with the Cossack Baroque/Skovoroda). It tells the story of the *Modern* Ukrainian nation through its texts.

### Phase 1: Foundations & The Vernacular (1798–1870s)
*The birth of the modern literary language.*
*   **Scope**: ~45 Modules
*   **Key Figures**: Kotliarevsky, Kvitka-Osnovianenko, Hulak-Artemovsky, Shevchenko (The Centerpiece), Kulish, Marko Vovchok, Panas Myrny.
*   **The Narrative**: From "Kotliarevsky's laughter" to Shevchenko's rage, to the establishment of Realism.
*   *Current Status*: Covers modules 01-30, but needs ~15 more (Myrny, Nechuy-Levytsky deep dive).

### Phase 2: European Modernism & The Fin de Siècle (1870s–1917)
*Breaking the "Peasant" stereotype. Integration with Europe.*
*   **Scope**: ~60 Modules
*   **Key Figures**: Ivan Franko (The Titan), Lesya Ukrainka (Drama), Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky (Impressionism), Olha Kobylianska (Nietzsche/Feminism), Vasyl Stefanyk (Expressionism), Vynnychenko.
*   **The Narrative**: "To Europe!" Psychology, philosophy, and aesthetics replace ethnography.

### Phase 3: The Executed Renaissance (1917–1933)

*   **The Narrative**: Kharkiv as a European capital. The creation of high urban culture and its physical liquidation by Moscow.

### Phase 4: Resistance, Stagnation & The Sixties (1933–1991)
*Preserving the Code in the Gulag and the "Thaw".*
*   **Scope**: ~45 Modules
*   **Key Figures**: Bahrianyi (Adventure/Gulag), Dovzhenko (Cinema/Prose), Symonenko, Stus (The Moral Absolute), Lina Kostenko (Historical Memory), Hryhir Tiutiunnyk.
*   **The Narrative**: The battle for honest words against Socialist Realism.

### Phase 5: Independence & Contemporary (1991–Present)
*Post-Modernism, Identity, and War.*
*   **Scope**: ~70 Modules
*   **Key Figures**: Bu-Ba-Bu (Carnival), Zabuzhko (Post-Colonialism), Andrukhovych, Izdryk, Zhadan (The Voice of the East), Prokhasko, Artem Chekh (War Lit), Iryna Tsilyk.
*   **The Narrative**: Deconstructing the Soviet legacy and forging a new political nation in war.

**Total LIT-MAIN Scope**: ~270 Modules.

## 🧪 Stream 2: LIT-SPEC (Specialized Tracks)

These tracks run parallel to the Canon. They allow for "binge-reading" in a specific style without needing historical context for every single text.

### 🧠 LIT-ESSAY (The Intellectuals)
*Priority: High (For C1/C2 Critical Thinking)*
*   **Focus**: Non-fiction, polemics, literary criticism, philosophy.
*   **Authors**: Shevelov, Dontsov, Malaniuk, Hrytsak, Zabuzhko (Essays), Sherekh.
*   **Goal**: Teach the learner how Ukrainians *think* and *argue* about themselves.

### 🚀 LIT-FANTASTIKA (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror)
*   **Focus**: Imagination and Genre Fiction.
*   **Content**:
    *   **Horror**: From Gogol (if claimed) to Kvitka-Osnovianenko's gothic, to moderns.
    *   **Sci-Fi**: Oles Berdnyk (The Ukrainian Strugatsky equivalent), Ihor Rosokhovatsky.
    *   **Fantasy**: The Dyachenkos (Translation issues discussed), Volodymyr Arenev, Dara Korniy (Urban Fantasy/Chimaeras).

### 🧸 LIT-KIDS (Children's Classics)
*   **Focus**: Reading fluency and cultural touchstones.
*   **Content**: Vsevolod Nestayko ("Toreadors"), Ivan Franko ("Fox Mykyta"), Sashko Dermansky.
*   **Note**: Not "baby books" but legitimate literature that every Ukrainian adult knows.

### ⚔️ LIT-HIST-FIC (Historical Fiction)
*   **Focus**: Narrative History.
*   **Content**: Pavlo Zahrebelnyi (The monumentalist), Roman Ivanychuk, Vasyl Shklyar ("Black Raven").
*   **Goal**: Immersive history through narrative.

## 🔗 The Chronological Chain

1.  **OES** (11th–13th c.): The Kievan Roots.
2.  **RUTH** (14th–18th c.): The Baroque & Polemical Transition.
3.  **LIT-MAIN** (19th–21st c.): The Modern Nation.

This structure ensures no gap exists from **Yaroslav the Wise** to **Serhiy Zhadan**.
