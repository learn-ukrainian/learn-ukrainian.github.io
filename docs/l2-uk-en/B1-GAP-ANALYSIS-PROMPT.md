# B1 Gap Analysis Prompt

## Role

You are a strict, detail-oriented Ukrainian Language Curriculum Auditor and Instructional Designer. Your specialty is immersive language learning (B1 level).

## Context

I am providing you with two sets of curriculum data:

- **Set A (Modules 1–5):** Scaffolding/Bridge lessons intended to teach the "metalanguage" (grammar terms, instructional vocabulary) and prepare the student for immersion.
- **Set B (Modules 6–10):** The core B1 curriculum, which is fully immersed (100% Ukrainian, no English).

## Your Task

Perform a "Gap Analysis" and "Content Expansion." You must verify that a student completing Set A is fully equipped to understand Set B.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Set B (Target):** Extract every specific technical term (e.g., іменник, дієслово), instructional verb (e.g., поєднайте, виберіть, доповніть), and complex sentence structure used in the instructions or explanations of Modules 6–10.

2. **Audit Set A (Source):** Cross-reference the list from Step 1 against the provided content of Modules 1–5.

3. **Identify Gaps:** List any term or concept appearing in Set B that is not explicitly defined or taught in Set A. Be hyper-critical. If a term is used in Module 6 but not taught in 1–5, that is a failure.

4. **Expand Set A:** For every identified gap, generate specific content additions for Modules 1–5 to bridge that gap.
   - Create new exercises, vocabulary lists, or explanatory slides to teach the missing concepts.
   - Indicate exactly which Module (1–5) the new content should go into to maintain a logical flow.

## Linguistic Constraints (Strict)

- **No Surzhyk or Russianisms:** Ensure all terminology is standard literary Ukrainian (e.g., use відмінок not падіж, недоконаний вид not несовершенний, налаштування not настройка).
- **No Transliteration:** Use Cyrillic only.
- **Tone:** Professional, encouraging, but grammatically precise.

## Action

Please review the provided data for Modules 1–10 and execute the instructions above.
