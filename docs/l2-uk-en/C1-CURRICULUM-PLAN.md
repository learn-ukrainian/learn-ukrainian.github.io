## Quality Standards & Pedagogical Strategy

**Reference:** `docs/l2-uk-en/MODULE-RICHNESS-GUIDELINES-v2.md`
**Philosophy:** `claude_extensions/quick-ref/philosophy.md` (Strict Linguistic Standards)

### Philosophy: Immersion & Analysis

At C1, the learner is no longer "studying" Ukrainian but "studying IN" Ukrainian.

1.  **Academic Rigor:** Modules must feature university-level texts.
2.  **Comparative Analysis:** A core pedagogical tool. Learners must compare multiple texts (e.g., a poem vs. a critique, or two opposing political articles) to develop critical thinking.
3.  **Writing Support:** All writing tasks (Essays, Critiques, Reports) **MUST include a Model Answer** to demonstrate the expected C1 register and structure.

### Advanced Activity Types (C1 Standard)

To meet the "Studying IN Ukrainian" philosophy, C1 modules must integrate these advanced production tasks:

| Type                    | Description                                       | Requirement                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **[essay-response]**    | Long-form argumentation (400+ words)              | Must include Rubric & Model Answer |
| **[critical-analysis]** | Deconstructs bias, tone, and rhetorical structure | Focus on "how" not just "what"     |
| **[comparative-study]** | Side-by-side analysis of 2+ texts/perspectives    | Mandatory for all LIT modules      |
| **[authorial-intent]**  | Evaluates author's purpose and hidden agendas     | Uses "Prosecutor's Voice" strategy |

> **Note on Activities:** The "Signature Activity Concepts" listed below are **mandatory pedagogical anchors**. The Module Architect must generate additional activities to meet the **minimum target of 16+ activities per module** (C1 standard).

---

## Vocabulary Approach (B1+)

**From B1 onwards, vocabulary is not prescribed in this plan.** Instead, vocabulary emerges naturally from the module's thematic content and is validated against:

- **Richness targets:** 30+ unique words per module (enforced by audit)
- **Integration requirements:** 80% used in activities, 50% in lesson text (enforced by audit)
- **Register appropriateness:** Vocabulary complexity matches C1 proficiency level

The "Content Guidance" sections below provide **thematic direction** and **pop culture anchors** to guide vocabulary selection, but builders have flexibility to choose words that best serve the pedagogical goals.

**Why this approach?**
- Content-driven vocabulary is more authentic and contextual
- Historical/cultural modules require domain-specific terminology
- Pop culture references evolve and need flexibility
- Quality is enforced through metrics, not prescriptive lists
