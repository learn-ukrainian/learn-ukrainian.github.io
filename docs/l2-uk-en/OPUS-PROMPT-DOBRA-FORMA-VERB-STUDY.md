# Opus Prompt: Dobra Forma Verb Pedagogy Deep Study

**Purpose:** Analyze how Dobra Forma teaches Ukrainian verbs to determine if our A1 verb modules need patching or complete redesign.

**Critical Question:** Should we patch our current A1 verb modules (M06, M08, M21, M22) or restructure the entire A1 verb sequence?

---

## Your Task

You are a pedagogical expert analyzing the teaching methodology of "Добра форма (Good Form)" - a highly regarded Ukrainian textbook from University of Kansas. Your goal is to extract pedagogical principles and determine if our curriculum needs redesign.

### Context: Problems with Our Current A1 Verb Modules

**Our A1 Verb Coverage:**
- **M06** - The Living Verb I: "Class I Conjugation" (-ати verbs)
- **M08** - The Living Verb II: "Class II Conjugation" (-ити verbs)
- **M21** - Yesterday - Past Tense
- **M22** - Tomorrow - Future Tense (буду + infinitive)

**Critical Issues Identified:**
1. ❌ **Non-standard terminology**: "Class I/II" doesn't exist in Ukrainian linguistics
2. ❌ **No aspect awareness**: Conjugations taught without mentioning imperfective vs perfective
3. ❌ **Missing reflexive verbs**: No -ся verb coverage in A1
4. ❌ **Aspect deferred 57 modules**: Not introduced until A2 M12
5. ❌ **Unclear pedagogical sequence**: Why this order? What's the logic?

**Our Current Approach:**
- M06-M08: Teach present tense conjugation patterns WITHOUT aspect
- M21: Teach past tense formation WITHOUT aspect awareness
- M22: Teach compound future (буду + inf) WITHOUT explaining it's imperfective
- A2 M12 (57 modules later): First introduction of aspect concept

## Analysis Framework

For each chapter, extract:

### 1. Pedagogical Structure

**Opening Strategy:**
- How do they introduce the topic?
- Examples-first (inductive) or rules-first (deductive)?
- What's the opening sentence/paragraph strategy?

**Core Presentation:**
- How do they organize information? (tables, lists, prose)
- What terminology do they use?
- How much Ukrainian vs English?
- Do they use visual aids (diagrams, timelines)?

**Example Selection:**
- What makes their examples effective?
- Do they use high-frequency vocabulary?
- Real-world contexts or constructed sentences?
- How many examples before moving to practice?

**Practice Design:**
- What types of exercises?
- Scaffolding progression (guided → independent)?
- Do they provide answer keys?

### 2. Terminology Audit

**For Present Tense Chapters (21.1-21.4):**
- What do they call verb groups? ("Class I/II", "First/Second Conjugation", "e-conjugation/и-conjugation", or something else?)
- How do they introduce the terminology?
- Do they use Ukrainian linguistic terms or English?

**For Aspect Chapters (27.1-27.4):**
- How do they define "perfective" and "imperfective"?
- What metaphors or analogies do they use?
- How do they explain the concept to non-linguists?

### 3. Sequencing Logic

**Critical Question: WHEN do they introduce aspect?**
- Is aspect introduced BEFORE present tense conjugations?
- Is aspect introduced DURING present tense chapters?
- Is aspect introduced AFTER basic conjugations are learned?
- What's the pedagogical reasoning?

**Reflexive Verbs Placement:**
- When do they teach -ся verbs?
- Before or after basic conjugations?
- Before or after aspect?

## Key Questions to Answer

### Question 1: Aspect Introduction Strategy ⚡ CRITICAL

**What we need to know:**
- At what point in the textbook do chapters 27.1-27.4 appear?
- Is this early (equivalent to our A1) or late (equivalent to our A2)?
- Do earlier chapters (21.1-21.4) mention aspect at all, even briefly?

**Look for:**
- "Imperfective" or "perfective" mentions in chapters 21.1-21.4
- Forward references like "you'll learn more about aspect in Chapter 27"
- Example sentences that hint at aspectual differences
- Any awareness-building before formal introduction

**Answer in this format:**
```markdown
### Aspect Introduction Timeline

**First Mention:** Chapter X.Y, page/section reference
**Type of Mention:** [Conceptual preview / Full introduction / Passing reference]
**Quote:** [Exact text where aspect is first mentioned]

**Formal Introduction:** Chapters 27.1-27.4
**Estimated Level:** [A1 equivalent / A2 equivalent / B1 equivalent]

**Pedagogical Approach:**
[Describe: Do they introduce aspect conceptually before conjugations, or teach conjugations first then add aspect later?]

**Our Current Approach Compared:**
[Explain how our approach differs and what implications this has]
```

### Question 2: Verb Group Terminology ⚡ CRITICAL

**What terminology does Dobra Forma use for verb conjugation groups?**

Look for:
- How they classify читати vs говорити
- What they call the -ати group vs -ити group
- Whether they use numbered systems or descriptive names

**Answer:**
```markdown
### Verb Group Terminology

**Dobra Forma Uses:**
- -ати verbs: [exact term they use]
- -ити verbs: [exact term they use]

**Examples from text:** [Quote showing how they use these terms]

**Standard in Ukrainian linguistics:** [Note if this matches academic terminology]

**Our "Class I/II" compared:** [Explain why ours is wrong and how to fix it]
```

### Question 3: Reflexive Verbs Placement ⚡ CRITICAL

**When and how do they teach -ся verbs?**

**Answer:**
```markdown
### Reflexive Verbs (-ся) Pedagogy

**Introduced in:** Chapters 23.1-23.2
**Placement in sequence:** [After basic conjugations? Before aspect? Integrated with aspect?]

**How they teach it:**
- [Approach to true reflexives vs lexicalized -ся]
- [How they explain -ся vs -сь alternation]
- [What examples they use]

**Missing from our A1:** [What we need to add]
```

### Question 4: Past and Future Tense Approach

**Do they teach past/future with aspect awareness or separately?**

**Answer:**
```markdown
### Past Tense (24.1-24.2)

**Aspect awareness:** [Yes/No - do they mention imperfective vs perfective past?]
**Examples:** [Do they show both читав and прочитав or only imperfective?]

### Future Tense (25.1-25.2)

**Two futures or one?** [Do they teach both буду читати AND прочитаю?]
**When introduced:** [Before or after aspect chapters?]
```

### Question 5: Overall Sequencing Logic ⚡ CRITICAL

**What's their pedagogical logic for the sequence?**

Map out the chapter order:
```markdown
### Dobra Forma Verb Sequence

Chapter 21: Present Tense (basic conjugations)
Chapter 23: -ся Verbs
Chapter 24: Past Tense
Chapter 25: Future Tense
Chapter 27: Aspect (full system)

**Pedagogical Logic:**
[Why this order? What builds on what?]

**Our Sequence:**
M06: Present -ати
M08: Present -ити
M21: Past
M22: Future
[57 modules gap]
A2 M12: Aspect

**Comparison:**
[Is our sequence fundamentally wrong or just needs adjustment?]
```

## Example of Excellent Analysis

Here's what a great answer to Question 1 looks like:

```markdown
### Aspect Introduction Strategy

**First Mention:** Chapter 21.2, Section "Verb Types"

**Type of Mention:** Conceptual preview (not full explanation)

**Quote:** "Some verbs describe ongoing actions (читати - to read), while others describe completed actions (прочитати - to finish reading). You'll learn more about this important distinction in Chapter 27."

**Formal Introduction:** Chapters 27.1-27.4

**Estimated Level:** A2 equivalent (appears after basic conjugations but before intermediate topics)

**Pedagogical Approach:**

Dobra Forma uses a three-stage approach:

1. **Stage 1 (Ch 21-25): Awareness Building**
   - Present tense chapters mention "ongoing vs completed" conceptually
   - Examples occasionally show aspectual pairs: давати/дати, брати/взяти
   - No formal terminology yet, just pattern recognition

2. **Stage 2 (Ch 27.1-27.2): Concept Introduction**
   - Define perfective/imperfective formally
   - Use timeline diagrams showing continuous vs point-in-time
   - Analogy: "Imperfective = movie (process), Perfective = photo (result)"

3. **Stage 3 (Ch 27.3-27.4): System Mastery**
   - Aspectual pairs by formation type
   - Usage in different tenses
   - Complex cases and exceptions

**Our Current Approach Compared:**

| Aspect | Dobra Forma | Our Curriculum |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| First mention | Ch 21 (early awareness) | A2 M12 (formal intro) |
| Conceptual intro | Ch 27 (systematic) | A2 M12 (same module) |
| Approach | 3-stage spiral | Single introduction |
| Gap from conjugations | ~6 chapters | 57 modules |

**Implications:**

Our 57-module gap is pedagogically problematic:
- Students learn conjugations without understanding aspectual restrictions
- Have to "unlearn" mental models later
- Miss why certain patterns exist (e.g., буду + imperfective infinitive)

**Recommendation:**

Add aspect awareness to A1 M06-M08:
- Brief note: "Ukrainian verbs come in pairs: ongoing vs completed"
- One example pair: давати (ongoing) vs дати (one-time)
- Promise: "Full system in A2!"

This builds awareness without overwhelming beginners.
```

**This is excellent because:**
- ✅ Specific references (Chapter 21.2)
- ✅ Direct quotes as evidence
- ✅ Clear comparison table
- ✅ Pedagogical reasoning (3-stage approach)
- ✅ Actionable recommendation with example

---

## Ready to Start?

1. Read all chapters in order (start with 27.1-27.4 for aspect)
2. Take notes using the framework above
3. Answer all 7 questions thoroughly
4. Write the comprehensive analysis document
5. Focus on the redesign decision (Question 6) - that's what we need most

**Good luck! Your analysis will determine the future of our A1/A2 verb pedagogy.** 🎯
