## Philosophy

> **The curriculum is the goal. Vibe is just a tool.**

Modules should be **rich, engaging, and comprehensive**. One curriculum module may generate multiple Vibe lessons - this is expected and encouraged. The curriculum should never be constrained by platform limitations.

**Grammar is a tool for communication, not an end in itself.** Every grammar point should be taught through:
1. **Real-world context** — when would someone actually use this?
2. **Cultural anchoring** — how does this connect to Ukrainian life?
3. **Narrative examples** — mini-stories, not isolated sentences
4. **Practical dialogues** — show the grammar in natural conversation

---

## Showcasing Ukrainian Richness & Beauty

To surprise and impress students, highlighting the beautiful, melodic, and rich nature of the Ukrainian language is paramount. Modules must actively integrate authentic cultural elements, showcase phonetic nuances, and highlight idiomatic expressions.

### 1. Phonetics & Nuance (The Sound of Ukraine)
- **IPA for All New Vocabulary:** Every new word introduced in the vocabulary table MUST have its full IPA transcription, regardless of level. This ensures pronunciation accuracy from A1.
- **Key Sound Spotlights:** Explicitly highlight challenging or unique Ukrainian sounds (e.g., Ї, Щ, Г vs Ґ, Ь) with detailed articulation guidance.
- **Melody Highlights:** Point out how specific sounds or grammatical structures (e.g., iotated vowels, soft signs, sentence stress patterns) contribute to the language's melodic quality.

### 2. Audio Integration (The Voice of Ukraine)
- **Mandatory Audio:** All new vocabulary, example sentences, key phrases, and dialogues MUST be accompanied by native speaker audio. Placeholder links can be used if actual audio generation is not yet integrated.
- **Intonation & Rhythm:** Audio should model natural Ukrainian intonation and rhythm, particularly in dialogues and longer texts.

### 3. Richness & Phraseology (The Wisdom of Ukraine)
- **Proverbs, Idioms & Set Expressions:** From B1+, modules MUST organically integrate Ukrainian proverbs, idioms, and stable phraseological expressions. These should be explained in context, not just listed. Aim for 1-2 new phraseological units per module.
- **Word Etymology:** Where appropriate, provide brief, engaging insights into the origin or cultural significance of a word.

### 4. Culture, Folklore & History (The Heart of Ukraine)
- **Beyond Basic Facts:** Engagement boxes should go deeper than simple facts.
- **Folklore/Traditions Corner (New Box Type):** `> 🎭 **Folklore/Traditions Corner**` for myths, legends, folk customs, and traditions.
- **Historical Context in Narrative:** Weave historical context naturally into narratives, especially in history and literature modules.
- **Decolonization Lens:** As per previous guidelines, actively dismantle imperial myths and celebrate Ukrainian achievements.

### 5. Grammatical Elegance (The Logic of Ukraine)
- **Highlight "Why":** For complex grammar points (cases, aspect, motion verbs), actively explain the elegance and logical beauty of the Ukrainian system, using relatable analogies where possible.
- **Case System:** Describe cases not just as endings, but as tools for expressing nuance and relationships.
- **Verbal Aspect:** Explain aspect as the "soul" of verbs, showing how it sculpts meaning.

| Type | A1 | A2 | B1+ | Description |
|------|----|----|-----|-------------|
| `quiz` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Multiple choice questions |
| `match-up` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Match pairs (Ukrainian ↔ English) |
| `group-sort` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Sort items into categories |
| `true-false` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Statement validation |
| `select` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Word selection from options |
| `fill-in` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Gap completion with options |
| `unjumble` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Reorder words into sentence |
| `anagram` | M01-10 | ✗ | ✗ | Letter unscrambling (Cyrillic scaffolding only) |
| `error-correction` | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | Find and fix errors |
| `transform` | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | Register shifts, paraphrase |

### Activity Priority by Level

**A1 (Beginner):** Recognition → Production
- Primary: quiz, match-up, group-sort, true-false
- Secondary: select, fill-in, unjumble
- Special: anagram (M01-10 only for Cyrillic scaffolding)

**A2 (Elementary):** Introduce error-finding
- All A1 types + **error-correction** (minimum 1 per module)
- Error-correction: 1 obvious error per sentence

**B1+ (Intermediate+):** Prioritize production & analysis

| Activity | B1 Min | B2 Min | C1 Min | C2 Min | Why Priority |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| fill-in | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | Core production skill |
| unjumble | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | Sentence construction |
| error-correction | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | Critical for accuracy |
| quiz | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Concept reinforcement |
| match-up | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Vocabulary/collocations |
| other | as needed | as needed | as needed | as needed | Variety |

**Rationale:** At B1+, learners need to *produce* correct Ukrainian, not just recognize it. Error-correction builds metalinguistic awareness essential for self-correction.

### Error-Correction Progression

| Level | Errors per Sentence | Error Types |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| A2 | 1 obvious | Gender agreement, case endings, animate accusative |
| B1 | 1-2 | + Aspect errors, participles, word order |
| B2 | 2+ subtle | + Style errors, register mismatches, Russianisms |
| C1-C2 | 2+ nuanced | + Stylistic inconsistency, academic register |

## Content Depth Requirements

### Vocabulary Policy: Active vs Passive

To ensure narratives are engaging and authentic (especially for History/Culture modules), we distinguish between two types of vocabulary:

1.  **Active Vocabulary (Target):** The ~25-40 specific words listed in the `Vocabulary` table.
    *   **Rule:** These MUST be drilled in activities.
    *   **Constraint:** Activities must ONLY test these words (plus prior module words).

2.  **Passive/Contextual Vocabulary:** Additional words used in the narrative to make the story flow or explain complex concepts.
    *   **Rule:** You ARE ALLOWED to use words outside the target list in the Narrative/Text sections to maintain richness and "Soul".
    *   **Constraint:** Do not test these in activities unless they are added to the table. Gloss difficult words if necessary.

### What Counts as "Content Words"

- ✅ Narrative paragraphs, explanations, cultural context
- ✅ Example sentences in flowing text
- ✅ Mini-dialogues and scenarios
- ✅ Engagement box text
- ❌ NOT vocabulary tables
- ❌ NOT grammar tables
- ❌ NOT activity instructions or answers

### A "Rich" Module Includes

- [ ] **Compelling introduction** (WHY, not "In this lesson we learn...")
- [ ] **Grammar tables surrounded by narrative** (no naked tables)
- [ ] **Mini-dialogues** showing grammar in real conversation
- [ ] **Usage patterns / Common mistakes** section
- [ ] **Multiple contextual examples** (not isolated words)
- [ ] **Phraseology Integration:** Use of proverbs, idioms, or set expressions (from B1+)
- [ ] **Engagement boxes** (varied types)
- [ ] **Cultural context** where relevant
- [ ] **Authentic materials** (real texts, media)
- [ ] **Production tasks** (speaking/writing) with **Model Answers** for self-correction
- [ ] **Self-assessment** checklist
- [ ] **Pronunciation guidance** (B2+ grammar modules)

### Red Flags for "Dry" Modules

- Tables with no surrounding paragraphs
- Introduction starts with "In this lesson we learn..."
- No mini-dialogues showing grammar in real conversation
- No "Common Mistakes" or "Usage Patterns" section
- Only ~150 words of narrative (rest is tables)

---

## Grammar-Focused Module Structure (TTT Approach)

**Pedagogy:** Test-Teach-Test (TTT) / Guided Discovery

Instead of: **Rule → Table → Exercises**

Use: **Context → Pattern Discovery → Practice → Real Application**

### Required Sections (A2+)

1. **Contextual Introduction (100+ words)**
   - Set up a real scenario where this grammar matters
   - Connect to cultural practices or daily life
   - Show WHY learners need this, not just WHAT it is

2. **Pattern Presentation with Narrative (80+ words per pattern)**
   - Brief table for reference
   - Paragraph explaining the pattern
   - Mini-examples in context
   - Engagement box connecting to culture/history

3. **Usage Patterns Section (150+ words)**
   - When to use vs. when NOT to use
   - Common mistakes and how to avoid them
   - Collocations and fixed expressions

4. **Mini-Dialogues (2-3 per module, 50+ words each)**
   - Show grammar in natural conversation
   - Vary scenarios (café, shop, home, work)
   - Highlight the grammar point with bold

5. **Cultural/Practical Connection (100+ words)**
   - How Ukrainians actually use this in life
   - Register notes (formal vs. informal)
   - Regional variations if relevant

---

## Vocabulary-Focused Module Structure (Narrative Arc)

**Pedagogy:** Content-Based Instruction (CBI) / Narrative-Driven

Instead of: **Table → Table → Table → Activities**

Use: **Story → Vocabulary-in-Context → Analysis → Retelling**

### Required Sections

1.  **Narrative Arc (Story-Driven) (150+ words)** — Vocabulary MUST be embedded in a compelling story or scenario.
2.  **Vocabulary Groups with Context (80+ words per group)** — Words in use, extracted from the story.
3. **Usage Patterns Section (150+ words)** — Collocations, what verbs go with what nouns
4. **Cultural/Real-World Connection (100+ words)** — How Ukrainians actually use these words
5. **Mini-Scenarios (150+ words)** — 2-3 short dialogues

### Minimum Content by Section

| Section | Min Words |
|---------|-----------|
| Thematic intro | 100 |
| Per vocab group | 80 |
| Usage patterns | 150 |
| Cultural notes | 100 |
| Mini-scenarios | 150 |
| **Total narrative** | **580+** (+ engagement boxes = 750+) |

---

## Engagement Boxes

### Required Types

| Box Type | Icon | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Did You Know? | 💡 | Fascinating facts |
| Myth Buster | 🔍 | Correct misconceptions |
| Pro Tip | ⚡ | Practical advice |
| Culture Corner | 🎭 | Traditions, customs |

```

### Placement Guidelines

- At least 1-2 boxes per module section
- Place after introducing new concepts (reinforcement)
- Use to break up dense grammar explanations
- Connect abstract grammar to real cultural context
- Make learners want to share what they learned!

### Box Content Principles

1. **Surprising** - Challenge assumptions
2. **Memorable** - Stick in the mind
3. **Accurate** - Verified facts only
4. **Relevant** - Connected to the lesson content
5. **Shareable** - "I didn't know that!" factor

### Examples by Level

- Origin of Cyrillic alphabet
- Ukrainian unique letters
- Why Ukrainian sounds different from Russian
- Famous Ukrainian words in English (steppe, borsch)

### Pop Culture References

**Good pop culture references:**
- Internationally known (Marvel, Star Wars, Harry Potter)
- Popular in Ukraine: Lord of the Rings, The Witcher, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series
- Video games with Ukrainian connections (S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Metro series - both made by Ukrainian studios!)
- Easy to translate/explain
- Make a teaching point (grammar, pronunciation, culture)
- Self-aware humor (like the Groot example about sentence length)

**Ukrainian pop culture gold:**
- **Lord of the Rings** - "орки" (orcs) became wartime slang; Tolkien's languages resonate with Slavic speakers
- **The Witcher** - Slavic mythology, hugely popular; Netflix series has excellent Ukrainian dub
- **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** - Made by GSC Game World (Kyiv); set in Chornobyl zone; iconic Ukrainian game
- **Metro 2033/Exodus** - Made by 4A Games (Kyiv); post-apocalyptic; Ukrainian voice acting
- **Cossacks** - Classic strategy game series by GSC Game World

**Ideas for pop culture boxes:**
- How would [character] say this in Ukrainian?
- Famous movie quotes in Ukrainian
- Ukrainian songs that teach grammar patterns
- Viral Ukrainian memes explained
- Video game localization quirks
- How Ukrainian dubbing differs from subtitles

**Format:**
```markdown

## Ukrainian Identity & Decolonization

### Philosophy

This curriculum takes a **decolonial approach** to teaching Ukrainian. For centuries, Russian imperial and Soviet narratives minimized, distorted, or erased Ukrainian language, history, and identity. Our role is to provide **accurate, factual information** that corrects misconceptions.

This is not about politics - it's about **historical accuracy** and **respect for Ukrainian identity**.

### Principles

1. **Ukrainian is a distinct language** - Not a "dialect of Russian," not "Little Russian," not derivative. Ukrainian has its own history, literature, and development path.

2. **Facts over narratives** - Present historically accurate information, even when it contradicts widely-held misconceptions. Cite sources when possible.

3. **Celebrate Ukrainian achievements** - Highlight Ukrainian contributions to world culture, science, literature, and history that have been overlooked or misattributed.

4. **Use proper Ukrainian** - Avoid Russianisms and Surzhyk in curriculum content. Teach standard Ukrainian vocabulary, not Russian calques.

5. **Name things correctly** - Use Ukrainian names for Ukrainian places (Kyiv not Kiev, Kharkiv not Kharkov, Odesa not Odessa).

### Common Misconceptions to Address

Use **🔍 Myth Buster** boxes when relevant:

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "Cyrillic is Russian" | Created in Bulgaria (9th c.); Ukraine adopted it independently |
| "Ukrainian is a dialect of Russian" | Separate East Slavic language with distinct development |
| "Kyivan Rus' was Russia" | Medieval state centered in Kyiv; "Russia" didn't exist yet |
| "Borsch is Russian" | Ukrainian dish; the word entered English from Ukrainian |
| "Holodomor was just a famine" | Deliberate genocide killing 4-10 million Ukrainians |
| "Ukraine means 'borderland'" | Contested etymology; Ukrainians reject this interpretation |
| "Russians and Ukrainians are one people" | Distinct nations with different languages, cultures, histories |

### Level-Appropriate Integration

| Level | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| **A1** | Factual corrections in engagement boxes (Cyrillic origins, word etymologies) |
| **A2** | Language comparisons, Ukrainian unique features, cultural facts |
| **B1** | Historical context, regional diversity, Ukrainian achievements |
| **B2** | Dedicated history modules, explicit myth-busting, literature |
| **C1-C2** | Critical analysis, propaganda recognition, academic discourse |

### Myth Buster Examples by Level

**A1 - Alphabet lesson:**
> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** "Cyrillic is the Russian alphabet"
> **Fact:** Cyrillic was created in Bulgaria in the 9th century, over 100 years before "Russia" existed. Ukrainian Cyrillic has unique letters (Ї, Є, Ґ) that Russian doesn't have!

**A2 - Food vocabulary:**
> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** "Borsch is a Russian dish"
> **Fact:** Borsch (борщ) is Ukrainian! The word entered English directly from Ukrainian. UNESCO recognized Ukrainian borsch culture as endangered heritage in 2022.

**B1 - History module:**
> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** "Kyivan Rus' was an early Russian state"
> **Fact:** Kyivan Rus' (Київська Русь) was a medieval federation centered in Kyiv. The name "Russia" (Росія) appeared centuries later. Moscow didn't exist when Kyiv was already a major European capital.

### What This Is NOT

- **Not anti-Russian bigotry** - We distinguish between Russian government narratives and Russian people
- **Not political propaganda** - We present historical facts, not political opinions
- **Not one-sided** - We acknowledge complexity where it exists
- **Not aggressive** - Tone is educational and matter-of-fact, not polemical

### Vocabulary Choices

Always prefer standard Ukrainian over Russianisms:

| Use ✅ | Not ❌ | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| вибачте | ізвіняюсь | Russian calque |
| будь ласка | пожалуйста | Russian word |
| квиток | білет | Russian *билет* |
| гаразд | ладно | Russian word |
| файно/чудово | класно | Russian slang |
| мабуть | наверно | Russian word |
| відчиняти (doors) | відкривати | Russian usage pattern |

## Module-to-Vibe Mapping

> ⚠️ **STALE / NEEDS REWORK**
> This section is currently outdated and requires significant rework to align with the new "Theory-First" approach and data structure. Do not rely on these mapping rules until updated.

### One Module → Multiple Vibe Lessons

A single curriculum module can generate:

| Vibe Lesson | Content |
|-------------|---------|
| Lesson 1 | Theory + Basic practice |
| Lesson 2 | Vocabulary deep dive |
| Lesson 3 | Interactive activities |
| Lesson 4 | Production + Review |

### When to Split

**Split a module into multiple Vibe lessons when ANY apply:**

| Trigger | Threshold | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Duration | > 60 min estimated | Learner fatigue, session limits |
| Vocabulary | > 25 words | Memory overload |
| Activities | > 5 activities | Too much in one session |
| Grammar points | > 2 major concepts | Cognitive overload |
| Content sections | > 4 distinct topics | Natural breakpoints exist |
| Engagement boxes | > 6 boxes | Information density |

### Splitting Approach

```
Module 01 (too long) → Split into:
├── Lesson 01a: Theory + first activity
├── Lesson 01b: Vocabulary + practice activities
└── Lesson 01c: Production + review
```

### Example Breakdown

**Module 201: Ancient Ukraine** could become:
1. **Vibe Lesson 201a:** Pre-history vocabulary + map activities
2. **Vibe Lesson 201b:** Scythian culture reading + comprehension
3. **Vibe Lesson 201c:** Founding of Kyiv narrative + listening
4. **Vibe Lesson 201d:** Production - describe ancient Ukraine
5. **Vibe Lesson 201e:** Review quiz + cultural discussion

**For now:** Start with 1:1 mapping. Mark heavy modules with:
```yaml
split_candidate: true
split_reason: "25+ vocabulary words, 6 activities"
```

We'll revisit after testing with real learners.

### Generator Adaptation

The generator (`scripts/generate.ts`) should:
1. Accept module markdown as input
2. Optionally split into multiple Vibe lessons
3. Maintain cross-references between lessons
4. Track which lessons belong to which module

## Pronunciation & Phonetics Guide (All Levels)

### When Required

Pronunciation guidance must be integrated actively across all modules where new sounds, challenging phonetic distinctions, or specific intonation patterns are introduced.

| Level | Focus Areas |
|-------|-------------|
| **A1** | IPA for all new vocabulary, key letter sounds (e.g., Ж, Щ, Ц, Г vs Ґ, Ь, И vs І), basic word stress. |
| **A2** | IPA for all new vocabulary, aspect-related stress shifts, challenging consonant clusters, basic intonation patterns for questions/statements. |
| **B1** | IPA for new vocabulary, stress changes in declension/conjugation, sentence rhythm, connected speech phenomena. |
| **B2+** | All above, plus stylistic intonation, regional accents (recognition), phrase stress, fine-tuning of articulation. |

### Required Components

1.  **IPA Transcriptions:** MUST be provided for *all new vocabulary* in the vocabulary table.
2.  **Key Sound Spotlights:** Dedicated sections or engagement boxes for challenging sounds (e.g., Г vs Ґ, Ь, И vs І), providing detailed articulation instructions (mouth position, tongue placement).
3.  **Stress Pattern Guidance:**
    *   For words with mobile stress (B1+), provide examples of stress shifts.
    *   Stress pattern tables for grammatical forms (e.g., passive participles).
4.  **Minimal Pairs:** For sounds that are easily confused, provide minimal pair examples (e.g., сім / сін).
5.  **Intonation Contours:** For sentence-level pronunciation, illustrate basic intonation patterns (e.g., for questions, exclamations, neutral statements).
6.  **Audio Integration (CRITICAL):** All spoken examples (words, phrases, dialogues) MUST have associated native speaker audio.

### Format Example (IPA for Vocabulary)

```markdown
# Vocabulary

| Word | IPA | English | POS | Gender | Note | Audio |
|------|-----|---------|-----|--------|------|-------|
| слово | /ˈslɔvɔ/ | word | noun | n | | [🔊](link_to_audio) |
```

### Format Example (Key Sound Spotlight)

```markdown
> 💡 **Key Sound Spotlight: Г vs Ґ**
> Ukrainian has two distinct 'G' sounds:
> - **Г (Hook):** A soft, breathy 'h' sound (like in 'ahoy'). Your throat barely vibrates.
> - **Ґ (Hook with Hat):** A hard, explosive 'g' sound (like in 'go'). Your throat vibrates strongly.
> Mispronouncing these can change meaning (e.g., Ганна vs Ґанна). Listen carefully and practice:
> [🔊](link_to_audio_g) (Ганна) vs [🔊](link_to_audio_g_hat) (Ґанна)
```

### Rationale

At all levels, accurate pronunciation is foundational. From A1, learners need clear guidance. At B2+, learners need to produce and perceive subtle phonetic and intonational distinctions for native-like fluency and effective communication across all registers.

## Grammar Module Example: BAD vs GOOD

### BAD (Rule-Dump Style)

```markdown
# Dative Case

The dative case shows indirect object.

| Noun | Nominative | Dative |
|------|------------|--------|
| мама | мама | мамі |
| друг | друг | другу |
| книга | книга | книзі |

## Exercises
1. Fill in the dative: Я даю ___ (мама).
```

### GOOD (Contextual Style)

```markdown
# Dative Case: The Art of Giving

In Ukrainian culture, giving matters. Whether it's a birthday gift, a cup of tea
to a guest, or advice to a friend — the ACT of giving is deeply woven into daily
life. And Ukrainian grammar has a special case just for recipients: the Dative.

The dative answers: **Кому?** (To whom?) — whenever something is given, told,
shown, or sent TO someone.

> 💡 **Did You Know?** Ukrainians traditionally give flowers in odd numbers
> (3, 5, 7...) for celebrations. Even numbers are only for funerals. So when
> you say "Я дарую мамі квіти" — make sure it's an odd bunch!

**Core Pattern:**

| Who receives? | Nominative | Dative | Example |
|---------------|------------|--------|---------|
| мама | мама | мам-і | Дарую мамі квіти. |
| друг | друг | друг-у | Кажу другу новину. |
| дитина | дитина | дитин-і | Читаю дитині казку. |

Notice the pattern: feminine nouns ending in -а get -і, masculine nouns get -у
(or -ові for people: другові, батькові).

**У реальному житті (In Real Life)**

You're at a birthday party in Lviv:

— Що ти подарував **Олені**?
— Я подарував **їй** книгу про Карпати.
— Вона любить гори?
— Так! Я завжди дарую **друзям** щось особливе.

Notice how the dative marks every recipient: Олені, їй, друзям.

**Common Dative Verbs:**
- **дарувати** — to give as a gift: Дарую мамі квіти.
- **казати** — to tell: Кажу другу правду.
- **показувати** — to show: Показую туристам місто.
- **допомагати** — to help: Допомагаю бабусі.
- **телефонувати** — to call: Телефоную батькам.

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment:** In the Ukrainian dub of "The Lord of the Rings",
> when Galadriel gives gifts to the Fellowship, every recipient is in dative:
> "Я даю тобі світло..." The grammar of giving!
```

## Vocabulary Module Example: BAD vs GOOD

### BAD (Table-Only Style)

```markdown
# Види спорту

| Спорт | English |
|-------|---------|
| футбол | football |
| баскетбол | basketball |

> 💡 Fact about sports
```

### GOOD (Contextual Style)

```markdown
# Види спорту / Types of Sports

Ukraine has a rich sporting culture. Football (футбол) is the most popular
team sport, with clubs like Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk competing in
European championships. Basketball (баскетбол) has grown rapidly, especially
among young people in cities.

| Спорт | IPA | English |
|-------|-----|---------|
| футбол | /futˈbɔl/ | football |
| баскетбол | /baskɛtˈbɔl/ | basketball |

**У реальному житті (In Real Life)**

Imagine you're at a café in Kyiv with new Ukrainian friends. They ask about
your hobbies:

— Чим ти займаєшся у вільний час?
— Я граю у футбол щонеділі з друзями.
— О, класно! А де ви граєте?
— На стадіоні біля університету.

Notice how we use "грати в" (play) with ball sports...
```
