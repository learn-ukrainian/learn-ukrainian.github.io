## Writing (Productive Skills)

| Can-Do Statement | Module Coverage | Status |

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gap: Summarizing Skills

**Problem:** M98 (Summarizing Information) was deleted in the restructuring, but "summarize information from different sources" is a core CEFR B1 can-do statement.

**Current partial coverage:**
- M90 (Presentations): Includes підсумок (summary) section
- M92 (Final Exam): Includes summarizing tasks

**Recommendation:** Add summarizing section to M90 (Presentations) since summarizing is a natural part of presenting information.

2. **Verify synthetic future is explicit in M09 content** - State Standard requirement
3. **All plans now aligned** - need content to match plans
