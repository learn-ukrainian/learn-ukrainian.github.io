> - ✅ Ukrainian channels: Ukrainian Lessons, Speak Ukrainian, Let's Learn Ukrainian
> - ✅ Content that celebrates Ukrainian identity and independence
> - ✅ Myth-buster boxes that debunk Russian propaganda (with "Prosecutor's Voice")
>
> **Before adding ANY YouTube video:**
> 1. Check the channel - is it Ukrainian-owned?
> 2. Check the title - any Russian references or comparisons?
> 3. Check the content - does it treat Ukrainian as its own language?
>
> **If in doubt, DO NOT USE THE VIDEO.**
