## Authoritative Sources (READ THESE FIRST)

| Document | Contains | Location |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `{LEVEL}-CURRICULUM-PLAN.md` | Grammar constraints, vocabulary lists, module specs | `docs/l2-uk-en/` |
| `MODULE-RICHNESS-GUIDELINES-v2.md` | Activity counts, engagement boxes, sentence complexity, activity templates | `docs/l2-uk-en/` |

**Before ANY module work:**
1. Open the curriculum plan for the level
2. Find the module number
3. Copy the EXACT vocabulary list
4. Read the grammar constraints for that level

---

## Creating a New Module

**Follow this workflow EXACTLY. Do not skip steps.**

### Step 1: GATHER CONSTRAINTS (Before Writing Anything)

1. **Open `{LEVEL}-CURRICULUM-PLAN.md`**
   - Find the module number
   - Copy the EXACT vocabulary list for this module
   - Read the grammar scope allowed at this level

2. **Open `MODULE-RICHNESS-GUIDELINES-v2.md`**
   - Note activity count requirement for this level
   - Note items per activity requirement
   - Note engagement box minimum
   - Note mini-dialogue requirement
   - Note sentence complexity (fill-in/unjumble word counts)
   - Note narrative richness requirements (see table below)

3. **Check previous module**
   - Read ending to ensure continuity
   - Note what "Coming Next" promised

### Step 2: WRITE THE MODULE

Write sections in this order:

1. **Frontmatter** — Title, subtitle, phase, objectives, grammar tags
2. **Lesson Content** — warm-up → presentation → practice → production
   - Hook with WHY this matters (not "In this lesson...")
   - Add engagement boxes as you go (💡 🎬 🌍 🎭 📜)
   - Include mini-dialogues showing grammar in use
   - Surround tables with narrative (no naked tables)
3. **Activities** — Create using ONLY vocabulary from Step 1
   - Meet activity count for level
   - Meet items per activity for level (12+ items)
   - Use 4+ different activity types
   - **Activity Order:** Warm-up (match-up) -> Core (fill-in, quiz) -> Complex (unjumble, translation)
   - **Unjumble:** Sentences MUST be 5-8 words long (no 3-word sentences!)
4. **Vocabulary** — Use format for this level

5. **Summary** — Include accurate "Coming Next" for next module

### Step 3: VERIFY BEFORE DELIVERING

**Scope & Accuracy:**
- [ ] Every word in activities appears in vocabulary or prior modules
- [ ] Grammar stays within level scope (no features from later modules)
- [ ] Activity answers have only ONE valid answer
- [ ] "Coming Next" matches actual next module topic

**Narrative Richness (CRITICAL — modules fail without this):**
- [ ] Introduction has compelling WHY (not "In this lesson we learn...")
- [ ] Grammar tables surrounded by narrative (no naked tables)
- [ ] Mini-dialogues present (see count below)
- [ ] Usage patterns / common mistakes section exists
- [ ] Content word count meets minimum (excluding tables)
- [ ] Engagement box count meets minimum

**Narrative Richness Requirements by Level:**

| Level | Content Words | Mini-Dialogues | Engagement Boxes | Examples |
|-------|---------------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| A1 | 600+ | 2+ | 3+ | 12+ |
| A2 | 750+ | 2-3 | 4+ | 18+ |
| B1 | 900+ | 3-4 | 5+ | 24+ |
| B2 | 1000+ | 4+ | 6+ | 28+ |
| C1 | 1100+ | 5+ | 7+ | 30+ |
| C2 | 1200+ | 5+ | 8+ | 32+ |

**What counts as "content words":**
- ✅ Narrative paragraphs, explanations, cultural context
- ✅ Example sentences in flowing text
- ✅ Mini-dialogues and scenarios
- ✅ Engagement box text
- ❌ NOT vocabulary tables
- ❌ NOT grammar tables
- ❌ NOT activity instructions or answers

**DO NOT deliver without verification. You WILL forget constraints.**

## Reviewing a Module

For each module, verify against the curriculum plan:

### 1. Grammar Scope (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Check module's allowed grammar in curriculum plan
- [ ] Verify NO grammar features from later modules appear
- [ ] See "Appendix: Grammar Constraints" in curriculum plan for exact rules

### 2. Vocabulary
- [ ] Count matches plan target (±10%)
- [ ] All planned words present
- [ ] No thematic drift (words from other topics)
- [ ] Example/activity nouns exist in vocabulary table or prior modules

### 3. Activities
- [ ] Minimum count met (see MODULE-RICHNESS-GUIDELINES-v2.md)
- [ ] At least 4 different types
- [ ] All words used are in scope
- [ ] **No `order:` activities** — replace any `## order:` with `## unjumble:`
- [ ] **Unjumble Complexity:** Are sentences 5-8 words long? (Crucial)
- [ ] **Activity Order:** Simple to Complex flow?

### 4. Narrative Richness (CRITICAL)

**This is where most modules fail. Check carefully.**

- [ ] Introduction has compelling WHY (not "In this lesson we learn...")
- [ ] **Grammar Tables:** Must have explicit headers (Case/Gender/Ending) and be surrounded by text.
- [ ] Mini-dialogues present and meet count for level
- [ ] Usage patterns / common mistakes section exists
- [ ] Content word count meets minimum (excluding tables)
- [ ] Engagement boxes meet minimum for level
- [ ] Examples are in context, not isolated words
- [ ] Ukrainian/English ratio matches level

**Narrative Richness Requirements by Level:**

| Level | Content Words | Mini-Dialogues | Engagement Boxes | Examples |
|-------|---------------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| A1 | 600+ | 2+ | 3+ | 12+ |
| A2 | 750+ | 2-3 | 4+ | 18+ |
| B1 | 900+ | 3-4 | 5+ | 24+ |
| B2 | 1000+ | 4+ | 6+ | 28+ |
| C1 | 1100+ | 5+ | 7+ | 30+ |
| C2 | 1200+ | 5+ | 8+ | 32+ |

**Red flags for "dry" modules:**
- Tables with no surrounding paragraphs
- Introduction starts with "In this lesson we learn..."
- No mini-dialogues showing grammar in real conversation
- No "Common Mistakes" or "Usage Patterns" section
- Only ~150 words of narrative (rest is tables)

### 5. Coming Next
- [ ] Matches actual next module content

## Common Issues by Level

### A1 Special Rules

| Topic | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Cases | Only Nom, Acc (M11+), Loc (M13+), Gen (M16+), Voc |
| Adjectives | Only from M26+ |
| свій | NOT at A1 (use мій/твій/його/її) |
| Imperatives | As phrase chunks only |
| Aspect | Default imperfective, avoid teaching aspect |

### A2 Common Issues

| Issue | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Missing IPA | EVERY word MUST have IPA |
| напроти/навпроти | Genitive, NOT dative |
| над/під | Instrumental (both direction AND location) |
| за + Acc | Include meaning "for" (support), not just "behind" |
| "Coming Next" | MUST match next module, NOT repeat current |

---

## Vocabulary Completeness Checklist

**CRITICAL: Every word used in the module MUST be in the vocabulary section or a prior module.**

### Words That Are Often Missing

| Category | What to check | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Verb pairs** | Both impf AND pf if either is used | продавати/продати, їсти/з'їсти |
| **Past tense forms** | Gendered forms used in examples | читав (m), читала (f), читали (pl) |
| **Comparative base** | If comparative is used, add base form | ближчий needs близький |
| **Words in tables** | All words in grammar tables | Words in "Imperfective → Perfective" tables |
| **Activity answers** | Every answer word | If answer is "забути", vocab needs забути |

### Cross-Check Workflow

1. **After writing lesson content**: Scan all example sentences for verbs/nouns
2. **After writing activities**: List all answer words, verify each is in vocab
3. **After writing vocab table**: Re-read activities to catch any missed words

## IPA Transcription Rules (Ukrainian)

### Vowel Accuracy

| Ukrainian | IPA | NOT | Example |
|-----------|-----|-----|---------|
| **и** | /ɪ/ | /i/ | вид = /wɪd/ NOT /wid/ |
| **і** | /i/ | /ɪ/ | він = /win/ |
| **е** | /ɛ/ | /e/ | |
| **о** | /ɔ/ | /o/ | |

**Key distinction**: Ukrainian "и" is a near-close near-front vowel /ɪ/ (like English "pit"), NOT close front /i/ (like "see").

### Common IPA Errors

| Word | Wrong | Correct |
|------|-------|---------|
| вид | /wid/ | /wɪd/ |
| син | /sin/ | /sɪn/ |
| ми | /mi/ | /mɪ/ |
| читати | /tʃitati/ | /tʃɪˈtatɪ/ |

---

## Activity Answer Constraints

### Fill-in Answers

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Single word only** | ✅ `будуть` ❌ `будуть вчити` |
| **Restructure if needed** | Change sentence to allow single-word answer |
| **Must be in vocab** | Answer word must exist in vocabulary section |

**If you need a multi-word answer**: Restructure the sentence so the gap requires only one word, or use a different activity type (unjumble for word order).

### Example Fix

**Before** (wrong — two-word answer):
```
Діти ___ завтра. (will study)
> [!answer] будуть вчити
```

**After** (correct — single word):
```
Діти ___ вчити завтра. (will)
> [!answer] будуть
```

---

## Fix Strategies

| Violation | Fix |
|-----------|-----|
| Dative at A1 | "Дайте мені" → "Я хочу" |
| Instrumental at A1 | "з другом" → "і друг" |
| свій at A1 | свою → мою/твою/його |
| Adjective before M26 | Remove or use noun only |
| Out-of-scope word | Replace with in-scope vocabulary |
| Missing IPA | Add transcription |
| `## order:` activity | Replace with `## unjumble:` (sentence word reordering) |

**Full Rewrite Triggers:**
- >30% violations
- Wrong level grammar
- Missing core sections
- **Narrative richness failure**: Content words <50% of requirement, no mini-dialogues, tables-only content
