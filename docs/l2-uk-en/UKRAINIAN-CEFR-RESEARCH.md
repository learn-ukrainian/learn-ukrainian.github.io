# Ukrainian Language CEFR Standards Research & Immersion Strategy

**Date:** 2025-12-07
**Purpose:** Research official Ukrainian language proficiency requirements and define a pedagogically sound immersion strategy.

## 1. Official Source Analysis: Ukrainian State Language Standard

**Document:** "Українська мова як іноземна. Рівні загального володіння А1 – С2"
**Authority:** National Commission for State Language Standards (2024)

### Findings on Language of Instruction

*   **No Explicit Ratio:** The Standard defines **outcomes** (competencies), not **methodology**. It does not prescribe a specific percentage of L1 (native language) vs L2 (target language) instruction.
*   **Implied Complexity:** The Standard requires A1/A2 learners to master complex morphological concepts (7 cases, gender agreement, aspect introduction) that are alien to English speakers.
*   **Pedagogical Inference:** Explaining abstract grammatical concepts like "perfective aspect" or "case government" *in Ukrainian* to an A1/A2 learner would create a cognitive overload, violating the "Theory-First" principle which prioritizes deep understanding.

## 2. The "Theory-First" Immersion Strategy (Revised)

**Objective:** Balance the goal of immersion with the necessity of deep theoretical understanding.
**Principle:** "English for the *Why*, Ukrainian for the *What*."

### Proposed Immersion Curve

| Level | Target Language (Ukrainian) | Instructional Language (English) | Role of English |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **A1** | **25%** | **75%** | **The Driver.** Used for all explanations, context setting, and cultural notes. Ukrainian is used *only* for target examples, vocabulary, and simple reading passages. |
| **A2** | **40%** | **60%** | **The Guide.** Used for explaining complex grammar (Aspect, Cases). Simple instructions ("Read text") switch to Ukrainian. |
| **B1** | **60%** | **40%** | **The Bridge.** Simple grammar explanations switch to Ukrainian. English reserved for complex syntax, nuance, and ensuring 100% comprehension of new concepts. |
| **B2** | **80%** | **20%** | **The Clarifier.** Most instruction is in Ukrainian. English is used *only* for very subtle distinctions, translation exercises, or comparative linguistics. |
| **C1** | **95%** | **5%** | **The Trace.** Full immersion. English exists only in "Language Link" boxes or specific translation tasks. |
| **C2** | **100%** | **0%** | **Native.** No English support. |

### Rationale for Adjustment

*   **A1 (Was 30% -> New 25%):** A1 modules focus heavily on *explaining* the Cyrillic alphabet, phonetics, and the concept of gender/cases. These require precise English analogies.
*   **A2 (Was 50% -> New 40%):** A2 introduces **Verbal Aspect**, the hardest concept for Slavic learners. 50% Ukrainian would force us to simplify these explanations too much. 40% allows for deep theory while increasing exposure.
*   **B1 (Was 75% -> New 60%):** B1 is the "Threshold". Moving to 75% too fast risks learners glossing over details. 60% is a safer "transitional" zone.

## 3. CEFR Thresholds for Transition

### The "Instructional Shift" Points

1.  **A1 → A2 (The Grammar Shift):**
    *   *Trigger:* Introduction of Cases (beyond Nom/Acc).
    *   *Action:* English remains dominant to explain *why* endings change.
    *   *Ukr Only:* Examples, simple commands ("Слухайте", "Читайте").

2.  **A2 → B1 (The Narrative Shift):**
    *   *Trigger:* Past/Future Tenses mastery + Aspect.
    *   *Action:* Narrative texts become 50/50. Theory remains English.
    *   *Ukr Only:* Cultural boxes, simple grammar definitions.

3.  **B1 → B2 (The Immersion Shift):**
    *   *Trigger:* Abstract vocabulary + Stylistics.
    *   *Action:* English is removed from instruction.
    *   *Ukr Only:* Everything except specific "Translation Challenges".

## 4. Transition Strategy: "Fading Scaffolding"

**Phase 1: Bilingual Mirroring (A1-A2)**
*   Every Ukrainian example is immediately followed by an English translation.
*   *Example:* "Я читаю книгу. (I am reading a book.)"

**Phase 2: Selective Glossing (B1)**
*   Ukrainian sentences are presented without immediate translation.
*   Only difficult words/phrases are glossed in brackets or footnotes.
*   *Example:* "Я читаю *захопливу* (exciting) книгу."

**Phase 3: Monolingual Definitions (B2+)**
*   New vocabulary is defined using simpler Ukrainian words.
*   *Example:* "Бібліотека — це місце, де зберігаються книги."

## 5. Summary of Changes to Guidelines

We will update `SKILL.md` and `MODULE-RICHNESS-GUIDELINES-v2.md` to reflect these **more realistic** percentages, ensuring the "Theory-First" approach is not compromised by artificial immersion targets.

| Metric | Old Target | **New Target** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A1 Immersion | 30% | **25%** |
| A2 Immersion | 50% | **40%** |
| B1 Immersion | 75% | **60%** |
| B2 Immersion | 85% | **80%** |

This adjustment aligns with the user's request to "give space for English explanations."
