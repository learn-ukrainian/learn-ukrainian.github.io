## 🚨 MANDATORY: NO RUSSIAN CONTENT

> [!CAUTION]
> **ZERO TOLERANCE FOR RUSSIAN CONTENT**
>
> Russia is committing genocide against Ukraine. Every day Russian forces bomb Ukrainian cities, murder civilians, kidnap children, and commit war crimes. In this context, mixing Russian content with Ukrainian language learning is **completely unacceptable**.
>
> **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:**
> - ❌ NO videos comparing Ukrainian to Russian
> - ❌ NO "Can Russians understand Ukrainian?" content
> - ❌ NO Russian-language learning resources
> - ❌ NO videos from Russian channels/creators
> - ❌ NO content that frames Ukrainian as a "dialect" or "variant" of Russian
> - ❌ NO content normalizing Russia or Russian culture
>
> **REQUIRED:**
> - ✅ ONLY pure Ukrainian content from Ukrainian creators
> - ✅ Ukrainian channels: Ukrainian Lessons, Speak Ukrainian, Let's Learn Ukrainian
> - ✅ Content that celebrates Ukrainian identity and independence
> - ✅ Myth-buster boxes that debunk Russian propaganda (with "Prosecutor's Voice")
>
> **Before adding ANY YouTube video:**
> 1. Check the channel - is it Ukrainian-owned?
> 2. Check the title - any Russian references or comparisons?
> 3. Check the content - does it treat Ukrainian as its own language?
>
> **If in doubt, DO NOT USE THE VIDEO.**
