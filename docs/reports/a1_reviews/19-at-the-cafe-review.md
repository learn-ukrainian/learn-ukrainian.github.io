# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
This module focuses on *usage* rather than new grammar, which is the right call for M19. It standardizes phrases like `Столик на двох` and `Рахунок, будь ласка`.

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
It flows naturally from Entering -> Ordering -> Eating -> Paying.

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
The "Common Mistake: Я хочу vs Я візьму" is a critical politeness nuance that saves learners from sounding rude.

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The breakdown of cases in the "Putting It Together" table (Nom, Acc, Gen, Loc all in one conversation) shows the learner how far they've come.

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
The "dessert culture" (Kyiv Cake, Napoleon) adds a sweet touch. Lviv coffee legend adds historical context.

# Content / Output Review

**1. Accuracy of Examples:** 10/10

- `Я візьму каву` (Polite future)

  All correct.

**2. Relevance of Scenarios:** 10/10
Asking for separate checks is a very common social situation often missed in textbooks.

**3. Cultural Nuance:** 10/10
The "tipping etiquette" (10%, cash vs card) is practical advice for any traveler.

**4. Formatting and Structure:** 10/10
Standard structure.

Synthesizes previous modules well.

# Activity / Drill Review

**1. Variety of Activity Types:** 10/10
Match-up, Quiz, Fill-in, True/False, Group Sort.

**2. Alignment with Content:** 10/10
The "Polite vs Direct" quiz (`Я хочу` vs `Я візьму`) directly reinforces the core etiquette lesson.

**3. Difficulty Curve:** 10/10
Appropriate.

**4. Quality of Distractors:** 10/10
Distractors test the specific politeness markers.

**5. Technical Correctness (YAML):** 10/10
YAML is valid.

# Final Score: 10/10

The perfect "capstone" for the food/shopping unit. It transforms a learner from someone who knows words into someone who can function socially in a Ukrainian café.
