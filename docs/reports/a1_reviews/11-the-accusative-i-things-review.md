# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
The explanation of the Accusative Case for inanimate objects is crystal clear. The distinction between masculine/neuter (no change) and feminine (change) is well-presented. The table layout used for "The pattern for inanimate objects" is excellent.

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
The module introduces the concept gently, starting with "what things ARE" (Nominative) vs "what you DO with things" (Accusative). The limited scope (inanimate only) prevents overwhelm before introducing animate in M12.

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
It correctly notes that only feminine -а/-я change. It covers the specific verbs that trigger accusative (бачити, брати, etc.).

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The "Real World" box about the post office provides immediate context for why this case matters constantly. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. reference effectively hooks gamer learners.

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
The tone is encouraging and practical. The "Prosecutor's Voice" is subtle but present in the precision of the grammar.

# Content / Output Review

**1. Accuracy of Examples:** 10/10
All examples are grammatically correct.

- `Я бачу стіл` (Masculine Inanimate - No change)
- `Я читаю книгу` (Feminine - Change)

**2. Relevance of Scenarios:** 10/10
The scenarios (Airport, Post Office, Café) are high-utility for a learner.

**3. Cultural Nuance:** 10/10
The cultural insight on gift-giving adds depth beyond just grammar. "Odd numbers for festivals, even for funerals" is a crucial cultural tip included.

**4. Formatting and Structure:** 10/10
Follows the standard module structure perfectly.

**5. Consistency with Curriculum:** 10/10
Builds perfectly on previous modules (Gender) and prepares for M12 (People).

# Activity / Drill Review

**1. Variety of Activity Types:** 10/10
Includes Quiz, Match-up, Fill-in, True/False, Group Sort. Good mix.

**2. Alignment with Content:** 10/10
Activities directly practice the animate/inanimate distinction (even though this module is inanimate focused, it preps the logic). The "Accusative Recognition" quiz is very targeted.

**3. Difficulty Curve:** 10/10
Starts with identifying the form, moves to filling in blanks, then to sentence construction basics.

**4. Quality of Distractors:** 10/10
Distractors like "книзі" (Locative/Dative ending) or "книга" (Nominative) effectively test the learner's grasp of the specific accusative ending.

**5. Technical Correctness (YAML):** 10/10
YAML structure is valid.

# Final Score: 10/10

A perfect introduction to the first major case change for learners. It simplifies a complex topic by isolating the inanimate aspect first.
