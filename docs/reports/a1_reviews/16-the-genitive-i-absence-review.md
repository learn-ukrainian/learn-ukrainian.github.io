# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
The concept of "Absence = Genitive" is explained with the "Magic Formula": `Немає + Genitive`. The comparison to English "Don't have" vs Ukrainian "By me there is no" is crucial for shifting the learner's mindset.

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
Genitive is a huge case. By isolating "Absence" as the first introduction (before possession or numbers), the module keeps cognitive load low.

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
It covers `без` (without) as another trigger for Genitive. It clearly lists the gender endings (`-а/-я` -> `-и/ї`, `-o` -> `-a`, Consonant -> `-a/-y`).

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The "Spatial Thinking" note ("absence is a location issue") provides a deep philosophical anchor for the grammar rule.

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
Use of Lord of the Rings ("I have no memory") again connects pop culture to grammar rules.

# Content / Output Review

**1. Accuracy of Examples:** 10/10

- `У мене немає часу` (Correct Genitive formulation)
- `Без цукру` (Correct preposition usage)
- `Немає проблем` (Idiomatic usage)
  All correct.

**2. Relevance of Scenarios:** 10/10
Running out of money, ordering coffee without sugar, asking for a pen—these are daily occurrences.

**3. Cultural Nuance:** 10/10
The section on "Ukrainians and Time" (`немає часу` vs `час завжди є`) offers a nuanced look at the pace of life in Ukraine.

**4. Formatting and Structure:** 10/10
Standard structure.

**5. Consistency with Curriculum:** 10/10
Introduces the next major Case (Genitive) smoothly.

# Activity / Drill Review

**1. Variety of Activity Types:** 10/10
Match-up, Group Sort, Fill-in, Quiz, True/False.

**2. Alignment with Content:** 10/10
The "Transform to Negative" activity (`У мене є час` -> `У мене немає часу`) is the perfect drill for this specific grammatical transformation.

**3. Difficulty Curve:** 10/10
Good progression.

**4. Quality of Distractors:** 10/10
Distractors test the specific genitive ending (`часу` vs `час`) and the structure.

**5. Technical Correctness (YAML):** 10/10
YAML is valid.

# Final Score: 10/10

An educational masterpiece on the Genitive of Absence. It simplifies a notoriously difficult case by focusing on a single, high-frequency function (`немає`).
