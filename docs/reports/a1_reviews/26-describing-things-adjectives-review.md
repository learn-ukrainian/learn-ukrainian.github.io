# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
Adjectives are a huge topic. This module handles them well by focusing on Hard Stems first, then briefly mentioning Soft. The table layout uses bolding (`нов**ий**`) to highlight endings.

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
Separates "Position" and "Antonyms" nicely.

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
Soft stem explanation (`синій`) is included but kept simple.

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The "Why Agreement is Good" box turns a grammar pain point into a "preview feature" benefit. Excellent framing.

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
Encouraging tone. "Reviewing the world!"

**2. Alignment with Content:** 10/10
Separate drills for "Meaning" vs "Grammar Form" is smart.

**3. Difficulty Curve:** 10/10
Progressive.

**4. Quality of Distractors:** 10/10
