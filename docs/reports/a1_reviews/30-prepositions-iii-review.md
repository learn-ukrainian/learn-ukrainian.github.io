# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
This module masters the "Three Questions" rule: `Де?`, `Куди?`, `Звідки?`. This is the fundamental key to Ukrainian case usage for beginners. The table summarizing Question -> Case is perfect.

Logically sequences Location -> Direction -> Origin.

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
Distinguishes between `до` (to a person/home) and `в/на` (to a place). This is a critical distinction often missed.

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The "Locations vs Directions" pairs list (`тут` vs `сюди`, `вдома` vs `додому`) is extremely helpful for learners who confuse these.

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
Practical and clear.
