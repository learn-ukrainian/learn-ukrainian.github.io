# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
The breakdown of past tense formation (stem + -в/-ла/-ло/-ли) is excellent. The comparison to English ("I worked" vs "She worked") immediately sets the stage for gender agreement.

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
Introduces the imperfective past first without overwhelming the learner with aspect details, but correctly flags it in an "Aspect Awareness" box.

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
Correctly explains the return of `-ва-` in verbs like `працювати` vs `працюю`. This is a crucial detail often missed.

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The "Magic Return of -ва-" section provides a satisfying explanation for why the form changes back to the infinitive stem.

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
The "Red Rue" song reference for `колись` is a great cultural touch.
