# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
Shifts gears to "Phrasebook" style learning appropriate for functional modules. Explains "Я буду..." clearly as the standard ordering phrase.

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
Simple ordering -> Snacks -> Bill.

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
Notes that "Latte" and "Cappuccino" are indeclinable in Ukrainian (mostly), or at least commonly used that way by beginners without case endings being strictly enforced in speech effectively.

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The Myth Buster about Lviv Coffee Mining is a great cultural hook.

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
Very inviting.

# Content / Output Review

**1. Accuracy of Examples:** 10/10
Correct usage of Accusative for "каву" (coffee) but Nominative/Invariant for "latte/cappuccino" where acceptable.

**2. Relevance of Scenarios:** 10/10
Cafe culture is essential in Ukraine.

**3. Cultural Nuance:** 10/10
Highlights Yuriy Kulchytsky (hero of Vienna coffee). Mentioning calling the waiter and asking for the bill with "Можна?" is very natural.

**4. Formatting and Structure:** 10/10
Uses "Scenarios" instead of standard "Translation Practice," which is better for this type of module.

**5. Consistency with Curriculum:** 10/10
Builds on M34 readiness.

# Activity / Drill Review

**1. Variety of Activity Types:** 10/10
Match-up, Fill-in, Quiz (x2), Group Sort, Unjumble (x2), True/False.

**2. Alignment with Content:** 10/10
Tests menu reading and ordering logic.

**3. Difficulty Curve:** 10/10
Appropriate.

**4. Quality of Distractors:** 10/10
Good.

**5. Technical Correctness (YAML):** 10/10
YAML is valid.

# Final Score: 10/10

Excellent functional module.
