# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
Introduces Reflexive Verbs (-ся/-сь) naturally through the context of daily routine. The table showing conjugation is clear.

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
Starts with routine vocabulary first, then explains the grammatical mechanism (Reflexive) later. This is good "Context First" pedagogy.

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
Correctly explains the `-ся` (consonant) vs `-сь` (vowel) rule, and the specific `-ться` pronunciation.

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The "Reflexive Pattern" box makes the concept less scary by equating it to "doing it to yourself".

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
Very relatable topic.

Standard structure.
