# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
The explanation of the Animate Accusative (Masculine Animate = Genitive) is handled brilliantly. The "Is it alive?" decision tree approach is very effective for learners.

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
Building on M11 (Inanimate), this module isolates the "People" aspect, which is the trickiest part of Ukrainian accusative. This separation is pedagogically sound.

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
It addresses the feminine animate "no change from inanimate pattern" rule clearly, preventing confusion. It also covers the -а masculine nouns (тато → тата).

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The comparison table (Animate vs Inanimate side-by-side) is the "click" moment. It makes the distinction visual and logical.

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
The Witcher reference ("Anyone" vs "Anything") is a fantastic pop-culture hook that illustrates the grammar rule in action.

# Content / Output Review

**1. Accuracy of Examples:** 10/10

- `Я бачу студента` (Masculine Animate - Genitive ending)
- `Я бачу подругу` (Feminine Animate - Accusative ending)
  All correct.

**2. Relevance of Scenarios:** 10/10
"Who are you waiting for?" is a very common social scenario that perfectly triggers this case usage.

**3. Cultural Nuance:** 10/10
The "Professions and Gender" section is excellent, highlighting the modern usage of feminitives (лікарка, директорка) which is culturally and politically relevant in modern Ukraine.

**4. Formatting and Structure:** 10/10
Standard structure followed thoroughly.

**5. Consistency with Curriculum:** 10/10
Direct sequel to M11, completing the Accusative introduction.

# Activity / Drill Review

**1. Variety of Activity Types:** 10/10
Good variety: Match-up, Group Sort, Quiz, Fill-in.

**2. Alignment with Content:** 10/10
The "Animate vs Inanimate" sorting activity is exactly what is needed to solidify this concept.

**3. Difficulty Curve:** 10/10
Appropriate progression from recognition to production.

**4. Quality of Distractors:** 10/10
Distractors like "брат" (Nominative) vs "брата" (Accusative/Genitive) effectively test the core rule.

**5. Technical Correctness (YAML):** 10/10
YAML is valid.

# Final Score: 10/10

An engaging and clear explanation of one of the Slavic languages' unique features (animacy). The cultural notes on feminitives add significant value.
