# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
The complex Ukrainian number agreement system (1=NomSg, 2-4=NomPl, 5+=GenPl) is broken down into clear, manageable rules. The 0-20 list is comprehensive with IPA.

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
It introduces the numbers first, then the logic. The "Genitive Plural" concept is introduced gently here as "the 5+ rule", which is a perfect soft entry before the full grammar explanation later in the curriculum.

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
It covers `один/одна/одне` and `два/дві` gender agreement correctly. The 11-19 pattern (-надцять) is explained well as a mnemonic.

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The "Pro Tip: Currency Forms" (1 гривня, 2 гривні, 5 гривень) is the most practical application of the rule and is highlighted effectively.

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. "Artifact" reference for counting is a great touch for the target audience. The history of "Hryvnia" (neck ring) adds depth.

# Content / Output Review

**1. Accuracy of Examples:** 10/10

- `Двадцять гривень` (5+ Gen Pl)
- `Дві гривні` (2-4 Nom Pl)
- `Одна гривня` (1 Nom Sg)
  All grammatically perfect.

**2. Relevance of Scenarios:** 10/10
Shopping at a market and ordering coffee are high-utility scenarios.

**3. Cultural Nuance:** 10/10
The section on "Bargaining Culture" (not common in shops, maybe in markets) is a crucial cultural tip to prevent embarrassment.

**4. Formatting and Structure:** 10/10
Standard structure.

**5. Consistency with Curriculum:** 10/10
Uses Genitive case (introduced in M16) effectively.

# Activity / Drill Review

**1. Variety of Activity Types:** 10/10
Match-up, Fill-in, Quiz, Group Sort, True/False.

**2. Alignment with Content:** 10/10
The "Number Categories" group sort (sorting phrases into 1, 2-4, 5+ buckets) is exactly the drill needed to master this concept.

**3. Difficulty Curve:** 10/10
Good progression.

**4. Quality of Distractors:** 10/10
Distractors test the specific endings (`гривня` vs `гривні` vs `гривень`).

**5. Technical Correctness (YAML):** 10/10
YAML is valid.

# Final Score: 10/10

A masterclass in teaching one of the trickiest parts of Ukrainian grammar (numbers) through practical, money-based examples.
