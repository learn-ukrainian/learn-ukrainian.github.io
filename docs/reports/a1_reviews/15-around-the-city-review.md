# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
The module breaks down navigation into manageable chunks: Places, Directions (straight/left/right), Prepositions, and Transport. The explanation of `на` + Locative for transport ("on the bus") is consistent with M13.

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
It introduces the vocabulary first, then the directional commands, then the complex interaction of "How to get there".

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
It covers `пішки` (on foot) vs vehicle travel clearly. It also notes the indeclinable `метро`.

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The distinction between `в` (direction toward enclosed) and `до` (movement toward) is handled well in the context of the dialogues. The "Metro Color System" real-world tip is highly practical.

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
Another S.T.A.L.K.E.R. reference connects the learner's gaming knowledge (map navigation) to real-world skills. The Marshrutka cultural insight is hilarious and accurate.

# Content / Output Review

**1. Accuracy of Examples:** 10/10

- `Іди прямо` (Imperative)
- `Я їду на автобусі` (Transport locative)
- `Біля парку` (Preposition)
  All correct.

**2. Relevance of Scenarios:** 10/10
"Lost Tourist" and "Asking for Metro" are the definition of survival survival skills.

**3. Cultural Nuance:** 10/10
The "Marshrutka" section is a gem. It explains not just the word, but the social etiquette (passing money, shouting "At the stop!"). The "Coffee as landmark" in Lviv is also a beautiful detail.

**4. Formatting and Structure:** 10/10
Standard structure.

**5. Consistency with Curriculum:** 10/10
Builds on M13 (Locative) effectively.

# Activity / Drill Review

**1. Variety of Activity Types:** 10/10
Quiz, Match-up, Fill-in, Group Sort (Directional vs Locational), True/False.

**2. Alignment with Content:** 10/10
The "Directional vs Locational" group sort (`Я в центрі` vs `Я йду в центр`) is a fantastic drill to distinguish static location (Locative) from motion (Accusative/Directional).

**3. Difficulty Curve:** 10/10
Appropriate.

**4. Quality of Distractors:** 10/10
Distractors test the preposition choice (`на` vs `у`) and directional verbs.

**5. Technical Correctness (YAML):** 10/10
YAML is valid.

# Final Score: 10/10

A highly practical module that not only teaches directions but prepares the learner for the reality of Ukrainian public transport.
