# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
As a checkpoint module, it perfectly synthesizes the previous 9 modules (Cases: Acc/Loc/Gen, Topics: City/Shopping/Numbers). Theoretically sound.

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
No new concepts, just integration. The "Integration Challenge" sections are excellent for forcing the brain to switch contexts (e.g., from Direction to Shopping).

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
It revisits the tricky distinctions: `в` vs `на`, `хочу` vs `візьму`, `1` vs `2-4` vs `5+`.

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The "Self-Check" prompts are very empowering ("Can you now do X?").

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
Encouraging and celebratory.

# Content / Output Review

**1. Accuracy of Examples:** 10/10
All examples are consistent with previous modules.

**2. Relevance of Scenarios:** 10/10
N/A (Checkpoint).

**3. Cultural Nuance:** 10/10
Refers back to Marshrutka, Tipping, and Bargaining.

**4. Formatting and Structure:** 10/10
Standard CP structure.

**5. Consistency with Curriculum:** 10/10
Perfect alignment.

# Activity / Drill Review

**1. Variety of Activity Types:** 10/10
Massive variety: Quiz, Match-up, Fill-in, Group Sort, True/False.

**2. Alignment with Content:** 10/10
The activities are categorized by "Skill" (Grammar, Vocabulary, Culture), which is helpful for diagnostics.

**3. Difficulty Curve:** 10/10
Challenging but fair.

**4. Quality of Distractors:** 10/10
High quality.

**5. Technical Correctness (YAML):** 10/10
YAML is valid and very extensive (800+ lines).

# Final Score: 10/10

A strong checkpoint that effectively validates the learner's progress through the "Survival Ukrainian" phase (City & Shopping).
