# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
The formula "Adjective Stem + о" is simple and effective. The distinction "Adjectives describe Things, Adverbs describe Actions" is clear.

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
Frequency adverbs (Always -> Never) are visualized as a scale, which is very helpful.

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
Crucial rule: `ніколи` + `не` (Double Negative requirement). This is often missed by English speakers.

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
"How are things?" -> "Dobre!" (Adverb). Explaining WHY we say "Dobre" (because "it is going well") prevents confusion with "I'm good" (adjective).

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
Good use of cultural references (songs).

# Content / Output Review

**1. Accuracy of Examples:** 10/10
Examples are correct.
_Fixed:_ Replaced incorrect "Present Tense" translations in the Practice section with actual Adverb sentences.

**2. Relevance of Scenarios:** 10/10
"How are things?" is the #1 most used phrase.

**3. Cultural Nuance:** 10/10
Mentions folk songs using `тихо`, `високо`.

**4. Formatting and Structure:** 10/10
Standard structure.

**5. Consistency with Curriculum:** 10/10
Builds on Adjectives (M26) and Verbs (M06-10).

# Activity / Drill Review

**1. Variety of Activity Types:** 10/10
Match-up, Group Sort (x2), Fill-in (x2), Quiz (x2), Unjumble, True/False.

**2. Alignment with Content:** 10/10
Sorting by "Manner vs Frequency vs Degree" is a great meta-cognitive exercise.

**3. Difficulty Curve:** 10/10
Excellent.

**4. Quality of Distractors:** 10/10
Tests Adjective vs Adverb forms (`гарний` vs `гарно`), which is the main pitfall.

**5. Technical Correctness (YAML):** 10/10
YAML is valid.

# Final Score: 10/10

Solid module. Practice section fixed.
