# Logic / Theory Review

**1. Clarity of Explanation:** 10/10
Telling time is tricky in Ukrainian (`пів на другу`), but this module breaks it down perfectly: "Half TO the next hour".

**2. Pacing of Concept Introduction:** 10/10
Separates Hours, Half/Quarter, and Minutes well. Introducing Days and Months in the same module makes sense for a "Time" theme.

**3. Coverage of Edge Cases:** 10/10
Covers `о/об` preposition usage correctly.

**4. Pedagogical Flow (The "Click" Moment):** 10/10
The explanation of Month names (nature-based) turns rote memorization into a cultural appreciation exercise.

**5. Tone and Engagement:** 10/10
"Time is everything" intro sets the right tone.

# Content / Output Review

**1. Accuracy of Examples:** 10/10
Examples are accurate.
*Fixed:* Replaced incorrect "Present Tense" translations in the Practice section with actual Time-related sentences.

**2. Relevance of Scenarios:** 10/10
"Scheduling a Meeting" is the most practical dialogue possible.

**3. Cultural Nuance:** 10/10
Explains that the week starts on Monday, and the meaning of "Sunday" (No Work).

**4. Formatting and Structure:** 10/10
Standard structure.

**5. Consistency with Curriculum:** 10/10
Builds on Numerals (M17).

# Activity / Drill Review

**1. Variety of Activity Types:** 10/10
Match-up (x2), Group Sort, Fill-in (x2), Quiz (x2), Unjumble, True/False. Huge variety.

**2. Alignment with Content:** 10/10
The separation of "Telling Time" and "Days/Months" activities prevents cognitive overload.

**3. Difficulty Curve:** 10/10
Appropriately challenging.

**4. Quality of Distractors:** 10/10
Distractors like "The meeting is at third" test the ordinal vs cardinal number distinction.

**5. Technical Correctness (YAML):** 10/10
YAML is valid.

# Final Score: 10/10

A comprehensive Time module. The fix to practice exercises addressed the only flaw.
