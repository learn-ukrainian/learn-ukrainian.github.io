# Lesson Contract — Curriculum Reboot (#1577 Phase 0 draft)

> **Status:** DRAFT v3 — signed off by Codex + Gemini in `architecture` channel
> thread `6de2be4789394536abdb6356cd5bb006` (round 2, both `[AGREE]`).
> Open questions §7 resolved per panel consensus. Activity matrix in §3.4
> aligned with `docs/best-practices/activity-pedagogy.md` per Codex
> finding. Component count corrected per Codex finding.
>
> v3 corrections from v2:
> - §3.4 activity types fully aligned with `docs/best-practices/activity-pedagogy.md`
>   (was contradicting it on Transcription, EssayResponse, Observe,
>   ReadingActivity, MarkTheWords, Classify, Select)
> - §3 component-count line corrected: 50 `.tsx` + 5 `.astro` overrides
>   = 55 files, minus `utils.tsx` = 54 non-utility components
> - §7 open questions resolved inline as policy
>
> v2 from v1: B1+ immersion is uniform 100 % Ukrainian across every tab
> body, with the **Словник (Tab 2) translation column + idiom/expression
> notes** as the ONLY sanctioned English at B1+. The stale `b1-m01-05`
> band in `scripts/config.py` does not exist in this contract — Phase 2
> config audit cleans up the file. Tab 2 ``VocabCard`` stays slim per
> EPIC #1581 (site-wide dictionary section is separate from per-module
> Словник).
>
> **Purpose.** This document is the single source of truth for the SHAPE of
> a published lesson. The North Star says what we're shipping and why; this
> says what artifacts the pipeline must produce, what tabs the published
> MDX must have, and which Starlight components live in which tab. Phase 3
> formalizes the per-component prop schemas in YAML; this doc defines the
> structural skeleton Phase 3 will fill in.
>
> **Scope.** A1 + A2 + B1 MVP (218 modules). Higher-level
> (B2 / C1 / C2 / seminar / PRO) component support is described where
> relevant but the MVP does not exercise it. The seminar-only / C-only
> components are noted as "out-of-scope-for-MVP."

## 1. Source artifacts the writer produces

Every module's authoring output is a small set of files at
`curriculum/l2-uk-en/{level}/{slug}/`:

| File | Purpose | Schema authority |
|---|---|---|
| `module.md` | Theory prose (lesson narrative) — Tab 1 source | Plan section structure + Starlight `:::tip` callouts + `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: {id} -->` placeholders + blockquoted dialogues |
| `activities.yaml` | Typed activity definitions — Tab 3 + inline-Tab-1 | `docs/ACTIVITY-YAML-REFERENCE.md`. Bare list at root, no `activities:` wrapper. Each item has `id`, `type`, `instruction`, type-specific payload |
| `vocabulary.yaml` *(or inline)* | Vocab list — Tab 2 source | Per `docs/best-practices/vocabulary-activity-standards.md`. Each entry: lemma + translation + part-of-speech + example sentence |
| `resources.yaml` *(or inline in `module.md`)* | External citations + media — Tab 4 source | Each entry: title + author + URL + access date + role (textbook/wiki/audio/video) |

Pipeline inputs the writer DOES NOT produce:

- **Plan YAML** — lives at `curriculum/l2-uk-en/plans/{level}/{slug}.yaml` (sacred, pre-existing, immutable mid-build per ADR-007 / non-negotiable rule §7).
- **Wiki packet** — context the writer reads but does not author. Owned by Phase 5+ wiki retrieval.
- **Annotation pass** — stress marks added deterministically AFTER review by `ukrainian-word-stress`, not by the writer.

### Plan Targets (PR2)

Plan YAML may declare an optional `targets` block. This is the unified,
machine-readable source for what a module introduces and deliberately
recycles:

```yaml
targets:
  new_vocabulary:
    - lemma1
    - lemma2
  new_grammar:
    - topic1
    - topic2
  recycle_vocabulary:
    - earlier-lemma
```

`targets.new_vocabulary` lists lemmas this module introduces.
`targets.new_grammar` lists grammar topics this module introduces.
`targets.recycle_vocabulary` is optional and names earlier lemmas the
module intentionally brings back. During PR2 migration, plans without
`targets` remain valid; tooling falls back to
`vocabulary_hints.required` for `new_vocabulary` so legacy plans keep
building while the explicit schema rolls out.

## 2. Published MDX shape

The pipeline's MDX assembler (today: `scripts/generate_mdx/core.py:267-364`)
produces ONE `.mdx` file at `starlight/src/content/docs/{level}/{slug}.mdx`
with:

- **Frontmatter:** `title`, `description`, `sidebar.order`, `sidebar.label`,
  optional `pipeline`, optional `build_status`, optional `draft`. Schema
  extension declared in `starlight/src/content.config.ts`.
- **Imports block:** every component used in the body, imported from
  `@site/src/components/...`.
- **One `<Tabs syncKey="module-tab">` block** with **exactly four
  `<TabItem>` children** in this order. Tab labels are the Ukrainian
  strings shown to learners; the English labels in the table are the
  canonical English aliases used throughout this contract:

| # | EN label | UK label (in code) | UK label (in handoff text) | What it contains |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Lesson | **Урок** | Урок | Theory prose from `module.md` after activity-id substitution and shared transforms |
| 2 | Vocabulary | **Словник** | Словник | Vocabulary cards / flashcard deck / phrase table from `vocabulary.yaml` |
| 3 | Activities | **Вправи** | **Зошит** *(handoff says Зошит — code says Вправи — open Q1 below)* | All activities from `activities.yaml`, rendered as their typed components |
| 4 | Resources | **Ресурси** | Ресурси | External citations, source attribution, embedded video links |

The 4-tab structure is fixed; learners always see all four labels even
if a tab is empty (the empty state is a localized "No vocabulary for
this module" / "Немає словника для цього модуля" message — already
implemented at `core.py:283-302`).

## 3. Component inventory — 1:1 mapping

See `docs/best-practices/writer-prompt-appendix.md` § Component inventory for the full React component → MDX mapping. The writer prompt does NOT inline this — the authoring fields (consumed by `scripts/yaml_activities.py`) are surfaced via the COMPONENT_PROPS_SCHEMA template substitution and the §Activity Authoring Fields section in `linear-write.md`, which is what the writer acts on. Reference the appendix only if you need to debug a downstream MDX-render issue.

Per-tab activity surfaces:
- Tab 1 — Урок: explanation prose, dialogues, vocabulary previews
- Tab 2 — Словник: full vocabulary list
- Tab 3 — Вправи: workbook activities (fill-in, quiz, match, select, error-correction, drag-drop, anagram, mark-the-words, multiple-choice, true-false, hangman, gap-fill, listening, pair-up, order)
- Tab 4 — Джерела: textbook citations + multimedia resources

Component compatibility note: legacy `fill-in-the-blanks` is Deprecated; subsumed by `mark-the-words` and `gap-fill` in the V7 component inventory.

## 4. Constraints the writer must obey

1. **Tab 3 activities use only the 22 type strings in §3.4** (or the
   B2+ extensions when explicitly authorized by the plan). Unknown
   types fall through to `ActivityPlaceholder` and FAIL Python QG.
2. **`<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: {id} -->` ids must resolve** to an entry
   in `activities.yaml`. Unresolved ids fail the build.
3. **Every Tab 4 SourceBox must trace back** to a citation present in
   the plan's `references` field or in the wiki packet. Ghost
   citations (a SourceBox not justified by source data) fail Python
   QG.
4. **Vocabulary in Tab 2** — every lemma is VESUM-verified or
   whitelisted in `PROPER_NAME_WHITELIST`. Translations come from the
   writer with contextual disambiguation (not Балла-direct lookup).
5. **No empty tabs without justification.** The plan should account
   for all four tabs. If a module legitimately has no external
   resources, the plan declares this and the empty state renders.
6. **Immersion is band-strict and tab-aware:**
   - **A1 + A2:** writer hits the per-band ramp from `scripts/config.py`
     IMMERSION_POLICIES across all four tabs.
   - **B1+ (including B2, C1, C2, all seminars):** **Tab 1 / Tab 3 /
     Tab 4 module body is 100 % Ukrainian.** No exceptions, no rescue
     notes, no parenthetical English glosses on grammar terms, no
     English mirror-translations, no English narrative scaffolding.
     Tab 2 (Словник) carries English translations + English
     idiom/expression notes as a structural carve-out — this is
     the ONLY sanctioned English at B1+.
7. **Decolonized framing across all four tabs.** Same standards in
   `docs/north-star.md` § WRONG apply uniformly: no Russianisms, no
   Russian-imperial cultural framing, no Soviet-era euphemisms.

## 5. Constraints the pipeline must enforce

Python QG (deterministic) catches:

- Missing tab content (any of the four tabs entirely empty when the
  plan asserts content for it)
- Unknown activity `type` strings
- Unresolved `INJECT_ACTIVITY` ids
- Vocabulary entries failing VESUM verification (with whitelist)
- SourceBox citations that don't roundtrip against plan / wiki packet
- Word count under `target_words`
- Forbidden lemmas (Russianism / Surzhyk / calque list — to be
  formalized in Phase 3 / Phase 4)
- A1 + A2: immersion ratio outside the band's tolerance per
  `IMMERSION_POLICIES`
- **B1+: Latin-character ratio in Tab 1 / Tab 3 / Tab 4 module body
  exceeds a small allowance for proper-name spellings + ISO codes
  (≤ 1 % default). Tab 2 is exempt from this check.**
- MDX renders cleanly under Starlight (`npm run build` smoke test —
  enforced in CI per Phase 4)

LLM QG (pedagogical, by a non-writer agent) scores:

- Naturalness of the Ukrainian prose
- Pedagogical flow (do sections build on each other; is the rule
  introduced before the practice)
- Decolonization (framing, examples, references)
- Engagement (does the prose hold attention; are dialogues real)
- Tone (peer voice, no AI slop, no robotic interrogations)

The two layers must NOT overlap. LLM does not score word count; Python
does not score tone. (See North Star § HOW.)

## 6. What this contract DOES NOT specify

- Per-component prop schemas (Phase 3 work — `docs/lesson-schema.yaml`)
- Wiki packet schema (Phase 5 work)
- Plan YAML schema (already defined in `curriculum/l2-uk-en/plans/`
  and `scripts/build/contracts/module-contract.md`; this doc accepts
  it as given)
- Per-level word targets (already in `scripts/audit/config.py`)
- Activity-type pedagogy (already in
  `docs/best-practices/activity-pedagogy.md`)
- Site-wide ``/dictionary/`` section design (covered separately by
  EPIC #1581; per-module ``VocabCard`` only cross-links to dictionary
  entries — see §3.3)

## 7. Resolved policy decisions (panel-confirmed 2026-04-25)

3-agent review thread `6de2be4789394536abdb6356cd5bb006` resolved the
following design questions unanimously. Each is now binding policy.

**P1 — Tab 3 canonical Ukrainian label = `Вправи`.**
The running code (`scripts/generate_mdx/core.py:356`) is canonical.
The handoff doc reference to `Зошит` was a drafting error and gets a
one-line correction. Reasoning: `Вправи` accurately translates
"Exercises / Activities" and matches every existing curriculum module;
`Зошит` (notebook) is conceptually closer to the Tab 2 vocabulary
deck and would be misleading. Source: panel consensus.

**P2 — Inline-AND-aggregate activity rendering is intentional.**
An activity referenced via `INJECT_ACTIVITY` in Tab 1 ALSO appears in
the Tab 3 aggregate. The Tab 3 aggregate adds a
`(see lesson, §<section-title>)` cross-reference next to each entry
that was already encountered inline, so the learner knows they are
reviewing an activity they have seen rather than meeting a new one.
Source: panel consensus (intentional reinforcement; explicit
cross-reference required).

**P3 — At least one inline activity per major section is required.**
The writer must place at least one `INJECT_ACTIVITY` marker per
major Tab 1 section. No maximum cap; writer discretion for additional
inline activities and for end-of-section placement. Reasoning: breaks
walls of text, paces cognitive load, prevents writer from frontloading
all activities into Tab 3. Source: panel consensus.

**P4 — At least one Tab 4 (Resources) entry is required per module.**
The plan ALWAYS has `references`, so at minimum the module's plan
references re-list as `SourceBox` entries in Tab 4. Empty Tab 4
fails Python QG. Reasoning: zero-cost enforcement that prevents
citation drift; the empty-state localized message remains in the
codebase only as a fallback for malformed plans. Source: panel
consensus.

**P5 — Out-of-scope MVP components are hard-rejected by Python QG.**
At A1 + A2 + B1, any writer output emitting an out-of-MVP component
type (per §3.4.b list) or a deprecated type (per §3.4.c) fails the
build deterministically. The writer prompt at MVP levels ships only
the in-scope component list as the complete option set. Reasoning:
the writer should never need the out-of-scope set at MVP levels; an
emission is a hallucination. Source: panel consensus, contingent on
the §3.4 matrix alignment with `activity-pedagogy.md` (now done in
v3).

**P6 — B1+ body-English Python QG threshold = ≤ 1 % Latin character
ratio in Tab 1 / Tab 3 / Tab 4 module body, with Tab 2 + citation
metadata excluded.** Token-aware tokenization
(skip URLs, ISO codes like `[uk]`, proper-name transliterations like
`Kyiv` inline next to `Київ`). Tab 2 (Словник) is exempt — the
translation column is structural English, not body English. Citation
metadata in Tab 4 (English source titles, English publisher names,
English-language URL paths) is also exempt. Source: panel consensus
on the ≤ 1 % default with Codex's refinement that enforcement should
be token-aware rather than raw-character-ratio-only.

**P7 — VocabCard cross-link to dictionary section: SUPPRESSED until
EPIC #1581 ships.** Per-module `VocabCard` at MVP levels does NOT
emit a cross-link to `/dictionary/{lemma}/`. Once #1581 lands, this
contract is amended (see §6) and the cross-link prop becomes
required. Reasoning: keep the contract simple now; amend only when
the dictionary destination is real. Source: panel consensus
(option c).
