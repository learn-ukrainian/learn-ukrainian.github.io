## Research Complete: RUTH Phase 2 (Sacred Word)

The deep research for Phase 2 is complete. I have defined the curriculum for Modules 26-50, focusing on the tension between the Vernacular (*Peresopnytsia Gospel*) and the Standardized Church Slavonic (*Ostrih Bible*).

**Status**: Research Completed & Approved by Claude.

### Summary
*   **Modules 26-35**: The Peresopnytsia Gospel (1561).
    *   *Focus*: Vernacular glosses, synonyms, dialectisms, and the visual style of the manuscript.
    *   *Pedagogy*: Analyzing how the translators made scripture accessible to the "simple people" (*Prosta Mova*).
*   **Modules 36-45**: The Ostrih Bible (1581).
    *   *Focus*: High Style, Greek calquing, and theological terminology.
    *   *Highlight*: Module 43 introduces Herasym Smotrytsky's early poetry.
*   **Modules 46-50**: Sacred Philology.
    *   *Focus*: The polemic debate (Vyshensky vs Smotrytsky) and Comparative Labs (Parallel Text Analysis).
    *   *Capstone*: Translating a modern prayer into the style of the Peresopnytsia Gospel.

### Next Steps
*   Generate plan files (`plans/ruth/26-translators.yaml`, etc.).
*   Extract comparative passages from litopys.org.ua.
