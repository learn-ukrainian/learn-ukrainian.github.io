# Issue Summary

Enrich/recreate 6 thin modules (M41-M46) that exist but are below 600 words.

## Context

The A2 Restructure Plan identified these modules as needing enrichment:
- M41: Shopping (Expanded) - thin content
- M42: Restaurants (Expanded) - thin content
- M43: Services - thin content
- M44: Banking - thin content
- M45: Post Office - thin content
- M46: Medical Appointments - thin content

These modules exist but lack sufficient content depth for A2 standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each module reaches ≥1000 words
- [ ] Each module has 10+ activities with 8+ items each
- [ ] Immersion within A2 target (40-55%)
- [ ] 25+ vocabulary items per module
- [ ] All engagement boxes present (4+)
- [ ] Passes full audit

## Work Estimate

~2 hours per module = ~12 hours total
