# Beginner Activities & Vocabulary

> **You are Gemini, generating activities and vocabulary for a beginner-level module.**
> **Your ONLY task: Generate activities YAML and vocabulary YAML.**

## Targets

| Target | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Skill identity | {SKILL_IDENTITY} |
| Module persona | {PERSONA_VOICE}, acting as {PERSONA_ROLE} |
| Activities required | {ACTIVITY_MIN}–{ACTIVITY_MAX} |
| Required types | {REQUIRED_TYPES} |
| Vocabulary items | {VOCAB_COUNT_TARGET} |

### Item Minimums Per Activity Type

{ITEM_MINIMUMS_TABLE}

**CRITICAL — HARD FAIL if violated:** Each activity MUST meet the minimum item count for its type. Activities with fewer items than the minimum will cause an automatic validation failure. Check the minimums table above BEFORE submitting.

{TEXTBOOK_ACTIVITY_EXAMPLES}

{DECODABLE_VOCABULARY}

## VESUM-Validated Word Bank (MANDATORY — use ONLY these Ukrainian words)

{LEXICAL_SANDBOX}

> **Every Ukrainian word in your activities MUST come from the word bank above.** Using words outside this list causes VESUM validation failures and triggers fix loops. If you need a word that isn't listed, use English instead.

## Module Constraints (HARD FAIL if violated)

{PEDAGOGICAL_CONSTRAINTS}

> **These constraints apply to activities too.** If only specific letters are allowed, every Ukrainian word in activities must use ONLY those letters. If sentences are not allowed, do NOT create sentence-level activities.

## Beginner Activity Rules

### Language in Activities

- **Questions, explanations, instructions** → English (scaffolding language)
- **Target content being practiced** → Ukrainian (letters, words, phrases)
- **Option text** → Ukrainian when selecting Ukrainian words/letters, English when selecting concepts

### Activity Types by Constraint Level

**If constraints say "letters/syllables only" (no sentences):**
Use: `quiz`, `match-up`, `group-sort`, `anagram`, `true-false`
Do NOT use: `fill-in`, `unjumble`, `cloze`, `error-correction`, `translate`

**If constraints allow words and simple phrases:**
Add: `fill-in`, `match-up` with phrases
Still avoid: `cloze` (needs 14+ blanks), `error-correction`, `unjumble`

**If constraints allow basic sentences:**
Add: `unjumble`, `fill-in` with sentences, `translate`
Still avoid: `cloze` (needs 14+ blanks)

### unjumble (sentence word reordering — ONLY when sentences allowed)

```yaml
- type: unjumble
  title: "Put the Words in Order"
  instruction: "Arrange the words to form a correct Ukrainian sentence."
  items:  # minItems: 8
    - words: ["книга", "Це", "нова"]
      answer: "Це нова книга"
    - words: ["великий", "дім", "Це"]
      answer: "Це великий дім"
```

**CRITICAL**: Use `words` (array of strings) + `answer` (string). Do NOT use `sentence`, `jumbled`, or `scrambled` fields — those are WRONG and will fail schema validation.

### Do NOT Use Grammar Terminology

A1/A2 learners do NOT know terms like іменник (noun), дієслово (verb), голосний (vowel), відмінок (case). Write questions in plain English.

❌ "Яка частина мови позначає дію?" (meaningless to A1)
✅ "Which letter looks like English H but sounds like N?" (clear)

## Schema Reference

### quiz (English questions, Ukrainian options)

```yaml
- type: quiz
  title: "Check Your Knowledge"
  instruction: Choose the correct answer.
  items:  # minItems: 6
    - question: "Which letter looks like English H but represents the /n/ sound?"
      explanation: "Н is a visual trap — it looks like H but sounds like N."
      options:
        - text: "Н"
          correct: true
        - text: "М"
          correct: false
        - text: "С"
          correct: false
        - text: "Л"
          correct: false
    - question: "What does the word сума mean?"
      explanation: "Сума means sum/amount in Ukrainian."
      options:
        - text: "sum/amount"
          correct: true
        - text: "bag"
          correct: false
        - text: "moon"
          correct: false
        - text: "mom"
          correct: false
```

Key: `explanation` at QUESTION level (not inside options), exactly 4 options, exactly 1 `correct: true`.

### anagram (letter scramble — M1-M10)

```yaml
- type: anagram
  title: "Unscramble the Word"
  instruction: "Rearrange the letters to form the correct Ukrainian word."
  items:  # minItems: 8
    - scrambled: "А М А М"    # SPACE-SEPARATED letters
      answer: "МАМА"
    - scrambled: "а н у л"
      answer: "луна"
```

**CRITICAL**: Letters MUST be space-separated. `scrambled` and `answer` must have exactly the same letters.

### match-up

```yaml
- type: match-up
  title: "Match Letter to Sound"
  pairs:  # minItems: 6 — MUST use "pairs:" not "items:"
    - left: "Н"
      right: "/n/ sound"
    - left: "М"
      right: "/m/ sound"
```

### fill-in (MUST include `options` array)

```yaml
- type: fill-in
  title: "Complete the Sentence"
  items:  # minItems: 6
    - sentence: "Мама купує ___."
      answer: "молоко"
      options: ["молоко", "молока", "молоку", "молоком"]  # REQUIRED: exactly 4 options, answer MUST be in the list
    - sentence: "Я бачу ___."
      answer: "кота"
      options: ["кіт", "кота", "коту", "котом"]
```

❌ WRONG: fill-in without `options` — every item MUST have `options` (exactly 4 strings)
❌ WRONG: `answer` not in `options` — the answer MUST appear verbatim in the options array

### group-sort

```yaml
- type: group-sort
  title: "Sort the Letters"
  groups:  # 2-4 groups
    - name: "True Friends (same look, same sound)"
      items: ["А", "М"]
    - name: "Visual Traps (different sound)"
      items: ["Н", "С"]
```

### true-false

```yaml
- type: true-false
  title: "True or False?"
  items:  # minItems: 8
    - statement: "The Ukrainian letter Н makes the same sound as English H."
      correct: false
      explanation: "Н looks like H but sounds like N — it's a visual trap."
```

## Activity Quality Rules

1. **Every Ukrainian word must be from the decodable vocabulary.** Do NOT use words with letters the student hasn't learned.
2. **Plausible, clear items.** Every question must have one unambiguous correct answer.
3. **No sentence-level activities** if constraints say letters/syllables only.
4. **Prefer fewer, high-quality activities** over padding. 6 good activities > 8 activities where the last 2 are filler.

## Mandatory Self-Check

1. **QUIZ single correct** — every quiz item has exactly 1 `correct: true`
2. **ANAGRAM letter match** — scrambled letters = same letters as answer (same count, same chars)
3. **MATCH-UP unique pairs** — no duplicate left or right values
4. **Schema compliance** — only fields from `{SCHEMA_PATH}`, no extras

## Allowed Activity Types

**ALLOWED (use ONLY these):** {ALLOWED_ACTIVITY_TYPES}

**FORBIDDEN (audit will auto-FAIL):** {FORBIDDEN_ACTIVITY_TYPES}
