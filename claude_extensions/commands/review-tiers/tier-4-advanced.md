# Tier 4: Advanced Levels (C1/C1-PRO/C2 Core)

> **Target:** C1 Core, C1-PRO, and C2 Core modules (NOT C1-HIST, NOT C1-BIO — those are Tier 3 seminars)
> **Pedagogy:** TTT/CLIL for Core; ESP+CLIL for C1-PRO
> **Immersion:** 100% Ukrainian
> **Experience Goal:** Advanced learning — sophisticated, nuanced, intellectually stimulating

## ADVANCED LEARNING EXPERIENCE AUDIT (Tier 4)

> **Key Question:** "Does this treat me as an advanced learner?"
>
> At C1/C2, learners are near-native. They need:
> - Sophisticated linguistic analysis
> - Nuanced explanations of subtle distinctions
> - Stylistic and register awareness
> - Academic and professional contexts
> - Intellectual challenge without condescension

### The "Did This Stretch Me?" Test

**Read the module as an advanced learner.** Ask:

| Question | Pass | Fail |
|----------|------|------|
| Was this at my level? | Appropriately challenging | Too easy or talked down to |
| Did I learn subtle distinctions? | Nuances I didn't know | Only reviewed basics |
| Was the linguistic analysis sophisticated? | Insightful, not surface-level | Oversimplified |
| Could I use this professionally? | Academic/professional application | Only casual usage |
| Did this respect my competence? | Treated as advanced learner | Felt like B1/B2 content |

**Scoring:**
- 5/5 Pass → Learning Quality 10/10
- 4/5 Pass → Learning Quality 9/10
- 3/5 Pass → Learning Quality 8/10
- 2/5 Pass → Learning Quality 7/10
- 0-1/5 Pass → Learning Quality ≤6/10

### Advanced Learning Arc

**C1/C2 modules need intellectual depth:**

```
PROVOCATION → EXPLORATION → NUANCE → MASTERY → APPLICATION
```

| Element | What to Look For | Red Flag |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| **PROVOCATION** | Challenging question, counterintuitive claim, or complex problem | Simple topic introduction |
| **EXPLORATION** | Deep dive into linguistic subtleties | Surface-level overview |
| **NUANCE** | Register, style, regional, historical variations | One-size-fits-all rules |
| **MASTERY** | Sophisticated understanding demonstrated | Basic comprehension only |
| **APPLICATION** | Academic, professional, literary contexts | Only everyday usage |

### Intellectual Engagement Mapping

**Required intellectual beats:**

```
🤔 Challenged → 🔍 Investigating → 💡 Insight → 🎓 Mastery → ✍️ Production
```

**Required moments:**
- ≥1 **Intellectual provocation** (challenges assumptions)
- ≥2 **Nuance revelations** (subtle distinctions)
- ≥1 **Register/style awareness** (formal vs. informal, literary vs. colloquial)
- ≥1 **Advanced application** (academic, professional context)
- ≥1 **Production opportunity** (create, not just recognize)

### Weak Moment Categories (C1/C2 Specific)

| Category | Pattern | Example | Required Fix |
|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **CONDESCENDING** | Explains obvious things | "Remember, Ukrainian has cases..." | Remove or deepen |
| **OVERSIMPLIFIED** | Misses nuance | "Always use X in situation Y" | Add exceptions, register notes |
| **B2_CONTENT** | Wrong level | Content appropriate for B2 | Increase sophistication |
| **NO_REGISTER** | Ignores style/register | Same examples for all contexts | Add formal/informal variations |
| **TEXTBOOK_ONLY** | No real-world complexity | Idealized examples only | Add authentic complications |
| **MISSING_DEPTH** | Surface treatment | Lists without analysis | Add linguistic analysis |
| **NO_PRODUCTION** | Recognition only | Multiple choice only | Add essay/production tasks |
| **ACADEMIC_GAP** | No professional context | Only conversational examples | Add academic/professional use |

### A+ Advanced Learning Checklist

| Criterion | A+ Standard | B Standard | C or Below |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Opening** | Intellectually provocative | Clear topic | Basic intro |
| **Depth** | Nuanced linguistic analysis | Solid explanation | Surface treatment |
| **Register Awareness** | Multiple styles/contexts shown | Some variation | One register only |
| **Examples** | Authentic, complex, varied | Good but limited | Simplified |
| **Activities** | Production-focused, sophisticated | Recognition + some production | Recognition only |
| **Application** | Academic/professional contexts | Some real-world | Textbook only |
| **Closing** | Synthesizes complexity | Summarizes | Abrupt |
| **Overall Feel** | "I'm a better linguist now" | "I learned more about X" | "This was review" |

## Dimension Rubrics (Tier 4 Adaptations)

### Immersion Targets (Advanced)

| Level | Target Range | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| C1.1 | 100% | Full immersion |
| C1.2 | 100% | Full immersion |
| C1-PRO | 100% | Full professional immersion |
| C2.1 | 100% | Full immersion, literary quality |
| C2.2 | 100% | Native-equivalent sophistication |

**No English scaffolding at C1/C2.** Metalinguistic terms in Ukrainian.

### Language Quality (Advanced Level)

**Ukrainian must be:**
- Native-level sophistication
- Stylistically appropriate for level
- Register-aware (formal, informal, literary, colloquial)
- No oversimplification
- Demonstrates the nuances being taught

### Activity Quality (Advanced Gates)

| Metric | C1/C2 Threshold |
|--------|-----------------|
| Naturalness | ≥9.5 (near-native) |
| Difficulty | C1/C2 appropriate (not B2) |
| Type variety | Must include production (essay, writing) |
| Distractor quality | ≥4.5 (subtle distinctions) |
| Intellectual engagement | ≥4.0 |

### Richness (Advanced Level)

**Richness means:**
- Authentic texts (not simplified)
- Literary and academic references
- Regional and historical variations noted
- Professional/academic contexts
- Sophisticated cultural knowledge

**Richness score minimums:**
- C1: 95%
- C2: 98%

### Humanity & Voice (Advanced)

**Different from lower levels:**
- Less "encouragement" (not needed at this level)
- More collegial tone (fellow linguist, not teacher)
- Intellectual respect
- Authentic engagement with complexity

| Marker | Minimum Count |
|--------|---------------|
| Direct address | ≥5 (collegial, not instructional) |
| Intellectual challenges | ≥3 |
| Nuance acknowledgments | ≥3 |
| "Consider this..." moments | ≥2 |

### LLM Fingerprint (Advanced Critical)

**Strictest detection, plus level-specific:**
- ❌ Oversimplification for advanced learners
- ❌ "Let's learn about..." (too basic)
- ❌ Generic examples without sophistication
- ❌ Missing register awareness
- ❌ No authentic complexity

**Threshold:** Any condescension or oversimplification → Fix required

## C1/C2 Specific Quality Markers

### Good C1/C2 Module Signs

- Opens with intellectual challenge, not basic intro
- Explores subtle distinctions (synonyms, near-synonyms, register)
- Shows formal vs. informal, written vs. spoken, regional variation
- Uses authentic texts (not simplified)
- Includes production activities (essays, stylistic analysis)
- Treats learner as near-native, not student
- Acknowledges complexity and exceptions
- Connects to academic/professional contexts

### Red Flags (Advanced)

- ❌ Starts with "In this lesson, you will learn..."
- ❌ Explains basic concepts (cases, aspects) as if new
- ❌ Uses simplified examples for advanced content
- ❌ Only recognition activities (no production)
- ❌ Ignores register and style
- ❌ Treats exceptions as "just memorize"
- ❌ No authentic text samples
- ❌ Condescending tone ("Don't worry, this is easy!")

## Learning Quality Rubric (Tier 4)

| Score | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 10 | Exceptional — sophisticated, challenging, respectful | None |
| 9 | Excellent — strong depth, minor polish | Light refinement |
| 8 | Good — solid but could be deeper | Add nuance, register |
| 7 | Adequate — competent but not challenging enough | Increase sophistication |
| 6 | Weak — too simple for level | Major depth increase |
| ≤5 | Poor — wrong level entirely | Full rewrite at correct level |

---

## Production Activity Requirements

**C1/C2 MUST include production activities:**

### Acceptable Types
- Essay response (stylistic, analytical)
- Text transformation (register shift, paraphrase)
- Creative writing (within constraints)
- Stylistic analysis (identify and explain)
- Error correction (nuanced, not basic)

### Unacceptable for C1/C2
- ❌ Simple fill-in-the-blank (unless testing nuance)
- ❌ Basic matching (unless subtle distinctions)
- ❌ True/false (unless deeply analytical)
- ❌ Recognition-only activities dominating

**Minimum production:** ≥30% of activities must require production, not just recognition.
