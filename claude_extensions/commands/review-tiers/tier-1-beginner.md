# Tier 1: Beginner Levels (A1/A2)

> **Target:** A1 and A2 modules
> **Pedagogy:** PPP (Present-Practice-Produce)
> **Immersion:** 10-70% Ukrainian (scaffolded with English)
> **Experience Goal:** Safe, encouraging tutoring — learner feels supported, not overwhelmed

---

## LESSON EXPERIENCE AUDIT (Tier 1 Adaptation)

> **Key Question:** "Does this feel like a patient, encouraging tutor?"
>
> At A1/A2, learners are fragile. They need:
> - Clear, simple explanations in English
> - Gentle introduction of Ukrainian
> - Lots of encouragement
> - Predictable structure (safety)
> - Quick wins (dopamine hits)

### The "Would I Continue?" Test

**Read the module as a nervous beginner.** Ask:

| Question | Pass | Fail |
|----------|------|------|
| Did I feel overwhelmed? | No, pacing was comfortable | Too much too fast |
| Were instructions clear? | Always knew what to do | Confused about expectations |
| Did I get quick wins? | Early successes, manageable chunks | Long slog before any reward |
| Was Ukrainian scary? | Introduced gently, with support | Thrown into deep end |
| Would I come back tomorrow? | Yes, felt encouraging | No, felt discouraging |

**Scoring:**
- 5/5 Pass → Lesson Quality 10/10
- 4/5 Pass → Lesson Quality 9/10
- 3/5 Pass → Lesson Quality 8/10
- 2/5 Pass → Lesson Quality 7/10
- 0-1/5 Pass → Lesson Quality ≤6/10

### Lesson Arc (Beginner Adaptation)

**Beginner modules need simpler arc:**

```
WELCOME → PREVIEW → PRESENT → PRACTICE → CELEBRATE
```

| Element | What to Look For | Red Flag |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| **WELCOME** | Warm greeting, context setting | Cold start, no orientation |
| **PREVIEW** | "Today you'll learn to..." (sets expectations) | Jumps straight into content |
| **PRESENT** | Clear explanation with examples, visual aids | Wall of text, no examples |
| **PRACTICE** | Guided → supported → independent progression | Too hard too fast |
| **CELEBRATE** | "You can now...", encouragement, progress marker | Abrupt ending |

### Pacing for Beginners

**Cognitive load is critical at A1/A2:**

| Metric | A+ Standard | Fail |
|--------|-------------|------|
| New words per section | ≤5-7 | >10 new words without practice |
| Concepts before practice | ≤2 concepts | >3 concepts before any exercise |
| English support | Present when needed | Missing when learner would struggle |
| Visual aids | Tables, charts for grammar | Prose-only explanations |

### Emotional Safety Mapping

**Required emotional beats for beginners:**

```
😊 Welcomed → 🤔 Curious but safe → 💪 Small win → 😊 Encouraged → 🎯 Progress visible
```

**Required moments:**
- ≥1 **Welcome/orientation** (you're in the right place)
- ≥1 **Curiosity trigger** (but gentle, not overwhelming)
- ≥2 **Quick wins** (you got this!)
- ≥1 **Encouragement** (don't worry, this is normal)
- ≥1 **Progress marker** (look how far you've come)

### Weak Moment Categories (Beginner-Specific)

| Category | Pattern | Example | Required Fix |
|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **OVERWHELMING_INTRO** | Too much Ukrainian too fast | First paragraph all Ukrainian | Add English scaffolding |
| **NO_QUICK_WIN** | Long content before any practice | 500 words before first activity | Add mini-exercise earlier |
| **MISSING_ENGLISH** | Learner left to guess meaning | Ukrainian without translation | Add translation/gloss |
| **SCARY_GRAMMAR** | Complex terminology for beginners | "Accusative case" without explanation | Simplify or explain term |
| **NO_ENCOURAGEMENT** | Flat, mechanical instruction | "Now do exercise 2" | Add "Great! Now let's..." |
| **TOO_MUCH_AT_ONCE** | >3 concepts before practice | 5 verb forms in one section | Split into smaller chunks |
| **MISSING_PREVIEW** | No "today you'll learn" | Jumps into content | Add learning objectives |
| **ABRUPT_END** | No celebration of progress | Module just stops | Add "You can now..." summary |

### A+ Beginner Lesson Checklist

| Criterion | A+ Standard | B Standard | C or Below |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Opening** | Warm welcome, clear preview | Basic intro | Cold start |
| **English Support** | Present throughout, scaffolded reduction | Present but inconsistent | Missing when needed |
| **Visual Aids** | Tables, charts, clear formatting | Some visual organization | Walls of text |
| **Pacing** | Small chunks, frequent practice | Reasonable chunks | Overwhelming sections |
| **Quick Wins** | Multiple small successes | At least one | None until end |
| **Encouragement** | Regular positive reinforcement | Some encouragement | None |
| **Closing** | Progress celebration, preview of next | Summarizes content | Abrupt end |
| **Overall Feel** | "I can do this!" | "I learned something" | "This is too hard" |

## Dimension Rubrics (Tier 1 Adaptations)

### Immersion Targets (A1/A2)

| Level | Target Range | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| A1.1 | 20-40% | Heavy English support |
| A1.2 | 40-60% | Increasing Ukrainian |
| A1.3 | 60-80% | Scaffolded transition |
| A2.1 | 40-60% | Review with more Ukrainian |
| A2.2 | 50-70% | Building independence |

### Language Quality (Beginner Adaptation)

**Ukrainian must be:**
- Simple vocabulary (high-frequency words)
- Short sentences
- Clear pronunciation guidance (IPA)
- Consistent grammar patterns (no exceptions early)

**English must be:**
- B1-level readability (accessible to non-native English speakers too)
- Contractions allowed ("you'll", "don't")
- Encouraging tone

### Activity Quality (Beginner Gates)

| Metric | A1/A2 Threshold |
|--------|-----------------|
| Naturalness | ≥5.0 (functional is OK) |
| Difficulty | appropriate (not too_hard) |
| Distractor quality | ≥3.0 (obvious wrong answers OK) |
| Variety | ≥40% (repetition aids learning) |
| Item count | Per level requirements |

### Richness (Beginner Adaptation)

**At A1/A2, richness means:**
- Clear examples (not creative prose)
- Visual organization
- Cultural context that's relatable
- Named Ukrainian references (but simple ones)

**Richness score minimums:**
- A1: 70%
- A2: 75%

### Humanity & Warmth (Beginner Critical)

**Higher thresholds for beginners:**

| Marker | Minimum Count |
|--------|---------------|
| Direct address (you, ви) | ≥15 |
| Encouragement phrases | ≥3 |
| "Don't worry" moments | ≥2 |
| "You can now..." validation | ≥2 |

**Warmth is CRITICAL at beginner level. <3 markers → COLD_PEDAGOGY → Auto-fail**

### LLM Fingerprint (Beginner)

**More lenient than higher levels, but still check:**
- ❌ "In this lesson, we will explore..." (generic AI opening)
- ❌ "It is important to note..." (formal AI voice)
- ✅ "Today you'll learn..." (friendly tutor voice)
- ✅ "Let's start with..." (encouraging, guiding)

**Threshold:** 2+ patterns → flag, but not auto-fail unless egregious

## Beginner-Specific Quality Markers

### Good Beginner Module Signs

- Learning objectives clearly stated in English
- New vocabulary introduced 3-5 words at a time
- Grammar tables are clean and visual
- Each section has practice before moving on
- Regular encouragement ("Great!", "You've got this!")
- Ends with "You can now..." celebration
- Preview of what's next

### Red Flags (Beginner)

- ❌ Opens with grammar terminology
- ❌ >10 new words without practice
- ❌ No English for first 200 words
- ❌ "This is easy" (patronizing)
- ❌ Complex sentence structures in Ukrainian
- ❌ No visual aids for grammar
- ❌ Testing before teaching
- ❌ Abrupt ending without encouragement

## Lecture Quality → Lesson Quality Translation

For A1/A2, "Lecture Quality" is renamed to "Lesson Quality" because:
- These aren't lectures, they're guided lessons
- Focus is on tutoring, not presenting
- Goal is safety and encouragement, not intellectual engagement

**Lesson Quality Rubric (Tier 1):**

| Score | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 10 | Exceptional — feels like a caring tutor | None |
| 9 | Excellent — encouraging throughout | Light polish |
| 8 | Good — solid but could be warmer | Add encouragement |
| 7 | Adequate — functional but cold | Significant warmth injection |
| 6 | Weak — feels like a textbook | Rewrite for warmth |
| ≤5 | Poor — discouraging or overwhelming | Full rewrite |
