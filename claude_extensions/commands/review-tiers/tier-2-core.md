# Tier 2: Core Levels (B1/B2 Core/B2-PRO)

> **Target:** B1, B2 Core, and B2-PRO modules (NOT B2-HIST, NOT seminar tracks)
> **Pedagogy:** TTT (Test-Teach-Test) for grammar; ESP for B2-PRO
> **Immersion:** 85-100% Ukrainian
> **Experience Goal:** Serious teaching — learner is challenged and grows

---

## TEACHING EXPERIENCE AUDIT (Tier 2 Adaptation)

> **Key Question:** "Is this effective, engaging Ukrainian teaching?"
>
> At B1/B2 Core, learners are ready for:
> - Full Ukrainian immersion (with occasional English for complex explanations)
> - Challenging content that stretches them
> - Real-world application
> - Genuine insights about the language
> - Teacher voice that guides without hand-holding

### The "Did I Learn?" Test

**Read the module as an intermediate learner.** Ask:

| Question | Pass | Fail |
|----------|------|------|
| Did I learn something new? | Clear "aha" moment | Just review or obvious content |
| Was the explanation clear? | Understood without re-reading | Had to guess or puzzle |
| Could I apply this in conversation? | Clear practical use | Abstract or disconnected |
| Was I appropriately challenged? | Stretched but not broken | Too easy or too hard |
| Did the teacher voice guide me? | Felt taught, not lectured at | Textbook or robotic |

**Scoring:**
- 5/5 Pass → Teaching Quality 10/10
- 4/5 Pass → Teaching Quality 9/10
- 3/5 Pass → Teaching Quality 8/10
- 2/5 Pass → Teaching Quality 7/10
- 0-1/5 Pass → Teaching Quality ≤6/10

### Teaching Arc (B1/B2 Adaptation)

**Core modules need effective teaching structure:**

```
HOOK → DISCOVER → EXPLAIN → PRACTICE → APPLY → SUMMARIZE
```

| Element | What to Look For | Red Flag |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| **HOOK** | Why this matters, real-world need | Generic "Let's learn about X" |
| **DISCOVER** | Test/examples before rules (TTT) | Rules dumped immediately |
| **EXPLAIN** | Clear grammar/vocab explanation with "why" | Just "what" without "why" |
| **PRACTICE** | Structured exercises with progression | Random or too easy exercises |
| **APPLY** | Real-world context, production tasks | Only recognition, no production |
| **SUMMARIZE** | Key takeaways, common mistakes | Abrupt ending |

### Pacing for Intermediate

| Metric | A+ Standard | Fail |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Concept density | 3-5 concepts per section | >7 concepts without processing |
| Example per concept | ≥2 examples | Concept without example |
| Practice per concept | ≥1 exercise | Content-heavy, practice-light |
| Section length | 300-500 words | >700 words without break |

### Engagement Journey Mapping

**Required engagement beats:**

```
🤔 Question → 💡 Insight → 📝 Practice → ✅ Mastery → 🎯 Application
```

**Required moments:**
- ≥1 **Driving question** (why does this matter?)
- ≥2 **Insight moments** ("So THAT'S why...")
- ≥1 **Challenge** (pushed beyond comfort zone)
- ≥1 **Real-world application** (when you'd actually use this)
- ≥1 **Common mistake warning** (anticipates confusion)

### Weak Moment Categories (B1/B2 Core)

| Category | Pattern | Example | Required Fix |
|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **RULE_DUMP** | Grammar rules without context | "Use accusative for direct objects" | Add real example first |
| **MISSING_WHY** | What/how but no why | "Perfective = completed" (ok, but why care?) | Add "why this matters" |
| **TEXTBOOK_EXAMPLES** | Generic, forgettable examples | "Іван читає книгу" | Use culturally rich example |
| **NO_CHALLENGE** | Content too easy for level | B1 grammar at A2 difficulty | Increase complexity |
| **ABSTRACT_GRAMMAR** | Rules without application | "Verbs agree in number and gender" | Show in real sentence |
| **WALL_OF_EXPLANATION** | >500 words of explanation | Long prose about case usage | Break up with examples |
| **PRACTICE_AFTERTHOUGHT** | Exercises seem tacked on | Random exercises at end | Integrate practice throughout |
| **COLD_TEACHER** | No personality or warmth | "The rule is..." (flat) | Add teacher voice |

### A+ Teaching Lesson Checklist

| Criterion | A+ Standard | B Standard | C or Below |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Opening** | Compelling "why this matters" | Clear topic intro | Generic start |
| **TTT Structure** | Test before teach, clear progression | Some discovery elements | Lecture-style delivery |
| **Explanations** | Clear, with "why" layer | Clear but shallow | Confusing or incomplete |
| **Examples** | Rich, culturally embedded | Generic but correct | Missing or poor |
| **Practice** | Progressive, integrated | Present but separate | Insufficient or disconnected |
| **Teacher Voice** | Guiding, encouraging, anticipating confusion | Present sometimes | Absent or robotic |
| **Closing** | Summarizes, warns of mistakes, looks forward | Basic summary | Abrupt end |
| **Overall Feel** | "I really learned something" | "I covered the material" | "I'm confused" |

## Dimension Rubrics (Tier 2 Adaptations)

### Immersion Targets (B1/B2/B2-PRO)

| Level | Target Range | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| B1.1 | 70-85% | Transition to full immersion |
| B1.2 | 85-95% | High immersion |
| B1.3 | 90-100% | Near full immersion |
| B2.1 | 95-100% | Full immersion |
| B2.2 | 98-100% | Full immersion |
| B2-PRO | 100% | Full professional immersion |

### Language Quality (Core Level)

**Ukrainian must be:**
- Native-level naturalness (≥8/10)
- Appropriate register for teaching
- No Russianisms or calques
- Euphony respected (у/в, і/й alternations)

**English (when used) must be:**
- Only for complex grammatical explanations
- Clear and accessible
- Not over-explaining simple concepts

### Activity Quality (Core Gates)

| Metric | B1/B2 Threshold |
|--------|-----------------|
| Naturalness | ≥8.0 (native-level) |
| Difficulty | appropriate (matches level) |
| Distractor quality | ≥4.0 (targets real errors) |
| Variety | ≥60% |
| Engagement | ≥3.5 |

### Richness (Core Level)

**Richness means:**
- Culturally embedded examples
- Real Ukrainian names, places, situations
- Proverbs/idioms that demonstrate grammar
- Dialogues that feel authentic
- Visual variety (tables, boxes, examples)

**Richness score minimums:**
- B1 Grammar: 95%
- B1 Vocab: 92%
- B1 Cultural: 90%
- B2 Core: 95%

### Humanity & Warmth (Core Level)

| Marker | Minimum Count |
|--------|---------------|
| Direct address (ви, давайте) | ≥10 |
| Encouragement | ≥2 |
| Confusion anticipation | ≥3 |
| Real-world validation | ≥2 |

**<2 markers → COLD_PEDAGOGY warning (not auto-fail, but fix)**

### LLM Fingerprint (Core Critical)

**Strict detection at B1/B2:**
- ❌ "It's important to note that..."
- ❌ "Let's dive into..."
- ❌ "Mastering X is crucial..."
- ❌ Generic examples without Ukrainian specificity
- ❌ Bullet-heavy without prose
- ❌ Encyclopedic tone

**Threshold:** 3+ patterns → LLM_CLICHE_OVERUSE → Fix required

---

## Core-Specific Quality Markers

### Good B1/B2 Core Module Signs

- Opens with compelling "why" (not just "today we'll learn")
- Uses TTT: example/question before rule
- Grammar explained with real-world "when you'd use this"
- Examples feature Ukrainian culture naturally
- Teacher voice anticipates common mistakes
- Practice integrated throughout, not just at end
- Closes with summary AND application reminder
- Appropriate challenge level (stretches but doesn't break)

### Red Flags (Core)

- ❌ Opens with "In this module we will explore..."
- ❌ Rules stated before examples
- ❌ "Іван і Марія" without cultural context
- ❌ No "why this matters"
- ❌ Practice only at the end
- ❌ Textbook passive voice throughout
- ❌ No anticipation of common errors
- ❌ Challenge level too easy or too hard

## Lecture Quality → Teaching Quality Translation

For B1/B2 Core, "Lecture Quality" is renamed to "Teaching Quality" because:
- Focus is on effective teaching, not presentation
- Goal is learning outcomes, not entertainment
- Teacher-student dynamic, not lecturer-audience

**Teaching Quality Rubric (Tier 2):**

| Score | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 10 | Exceptional — clear insights, effective teaching | None |
| 9 | Excellent — strong teaching throughout | Light polish |
| 8 | Good — solid but missing depth or engagement | Enhance "why" layer |
| 7 | Adequate — covers material but not memorable | Add insights, warmth |
| 6 | Weak — textbook style, no personality | Significant rewrite |
| ≤5 | Poor — confusing or ineffective | Full rewrite |

---

## Grammar Module Specific Checks

For B1/B2 grammar modules, additional checks:

### Aspectual Pair Verification

**If module claims aspectual pairs:**
1. Both verbs share same core meaning
2. They differ only in aspect
3. Cross-reference: Ohoiko "500+ Ukrainian Verbs", slovnyk.ua

**Common Error Pattern:**
| ❌ WRONG | ✅ CORRECT |
|----------|-----------|
| шукати / знайти (different meanings) | шукати / пошукати |
| питати / відповідати (different) | питати / запитати |

### Grammar Rule Accuracy

- Verify case usage rules
- Verify verb conjugation patterns
- Verify agreement rules
- Flag unsupported claims

### Linguistic Accuracy Score Impact

Factual errors in grammar modules are AUTO-FAIL regardless of other scores.
