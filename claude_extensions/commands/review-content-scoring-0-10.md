# 0-10 Scoring System for Content Quality Reviews

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** Use this 0-10 scale for ALL dimension scores. High scores require justification. Perfect scores (10/10) should be rare.

---

## Scoring Philosophy

**Score Distribution:**
- **0-4 = FAIL** → Auto-fail gates, critical issues, must fix before passing
- **5-6 = PASS (Minimum)** → Meets gates, acceptable quality, has noticeable weaknesses
- **7-8 = GOOD** → Solid quality, minor improvements possible, above minimum standards
- **9-10 = EXCELLENT** → Exceptional quality, reference-worthy, innovative or exemplary

**Mandatory Justification Rule:**
- **For scores ≥8:** Explain what would make it higher (or why it's already 10/10)
- **For scores ≤6:** Explain specific weaknesses and what's missing
- **For score 7:** Explain both: what's good AND what could be better

## Dimension Rubrics

### 1. Coherence (0-10)

**What it measures:** Logical flow, section transitions, narrative structure

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 0-4 | **FAIL** - Incoherent structure | Contradictory statements, missing sections, no logical flow, random order |
| 5-6 | **Acceptable** - Basic structure | All sections present, some awkward transitions, occasional jumps, adequate sequencing |
| 7-8 | **Good** - Clear flow | Logical progression, smooth transitions, clear section purpose, good pedagogical sequence |
| 9-10 | **Excellent** - Seamless narrative | Perfect flow, each section builds on previous, transitions are natural, exemplary structure |

**Example justification:**
> Coherence: 8/10 - Strong logical flow from Test → Explanation → Practice. Transitions between examples are smooth. However, the jump from Section 3 (Aspect basics) to Section 4 (Advanced usage) is abrupt - would benefit from a bridging paragraph. A 9/10 would have: "Тепер, коли ми розуміємо базові принципи, давайте подивимося на складніші випадки..."

---

### 2. Relevance (0-10)

**What it measures:** Alignment with module goals, curriculum plan, and level targets

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 0-4 | **FAIL** - Off-topic | Wrong grammar focus, unrelated vocabulary, doesn't match curriculum plan |
| 5-6 | **Acceptable** - On-topic but loose | Covers required material but includes tangents, some vocabulary not in plan |
| 7-8 | **Good** - Focused | Stays on topic, follows curriculum plan, all content serves learning goals |
| 9-10 | **Excellent** - Laser-focused | Every sentence advances learning goals, perfect alignment with plan, no filler |

**Example justification:**
> Relevance: 7/10 - Module covers all required aspect pairs from curriculum plan (зробити/робити, написати/писати, etc.). However, includes digression about historical development of aspect (150 words) that doesn't serve B1 learning goals. A 9/10 would cut tangents and use that space for more practice examples.

---

### 3. Educational (0-10)

**What it measures:** Clear explanations, useful examples, learning effectiveness

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 0-4 | **FAIL** - Confusing or wrong | Incorrect information, unclear explanations, missing key concepts |
| 5-6 | **Acceptable** - Gets the job done | Explanations are adequate but dry, examples work but uninspiring, misses some nuances |
| 7-8 | **Good** - Clear and helpful | Strong explanations, good examples, covers edge cases, learns from examples |
| 9-10 | **Excellent** - Outstanding pedagogy | Crystal-clear explanations, memorable examples, anticipates confusion, "aha moments" |

**Example justification:**
> Educational: 9/10 - Exceptional explanation quality. The analogy comparing perfective aspect to "taking a photo" vs imperfective as "filming video" is brilliant and memorable. Examples progress from simple (Я прочитав книгу) to complex (aspect with negation). Only minor gap: doesn't explicitly address why "Я читав книгу рік" (time duration) forces imperfective. A 10/10 would add this edge case.

---

### 4. Language (0-10)

**What it measures:** Ukrainian quality, absence of Russianisms/calques, euphony, naturalness

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 0-4 | **FAIL** - Major errors | Multiple Russianisms (кушать, извините), calques (робити сенс), Surzhyk, broken grammar |
| 5-6 | **Acceptable** - Functional | Mostly correct, 1-2 minor Russianisms, occasional unnatural phrasing, comprehensible |
| 7-8 | **Good** - Natural Ukrainian | No Russianisms, natural phrasing, good euphony, appropriate register |
| 9-10 | **Excellent** - Native-level mastery | Flawless Ukrainian, beautiful euphony, rich vocabulary, stylistically elegant |

**Example justification:**
> Language: 6/10 - No Russianisms detected, but several unnatural phrases: "в той самий час" (calque of "at the same time", should be "водночас" or "тим часом"), "робити вибір" (should be "робити вибір" is actually OK, scratch that - "обирати"). Grammar is correct but lacks euphonic flow. A 7/10 would fix calques, 8/10 would improve euphony with better word order.

---

### 5. Pedagogy (0-10)

**What it measures:** Teaching approach, scaffolding, level-appropriateness, TTT/CBI/PPP alignment

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 0-4 | **FAIL** - Pedagogically broken | Wrong approach for module type, no scaffolding, inappropriate for level, violates TTT/CBI principles |
| 5-6 | **Acceptable** - Basic pedagogy | Follows template loosely, some scaffolding, mostly appropriate for level |
| 7-8 | **Good** - Solid pedagogy | Proper TTT/CBI/PPP structure, good scaffolding, level-appropriate, follows template |
| 9-10 | **Excellent** - Exemplary teaching | Perfect template adherence, exceptional scaffolding, innovative approaches, ideal for level |

**Example justification:**
> Pedagogy: 8/10 - Strong TTT structure (Test → Teach → Test). Discovery-based learning in Section 2 (observe-first) works well. Activities progress from recognition (quiz) to production (error-correction). However, cloze activity appears before error-correction, which reverses difficulty curve (cloze is harder). A 9/10 would sequence activities by cognitive load: quiz → match-up → fill-in → error-correction → cloze.

---

### 6. Immersion (0-10)

**What it measures:** Ukrainian-to-English ratio, appropriate scaffolding for level

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 0-4 | **FAIL** - Wrong immersion level | A1 with 90% Ukrainian, B2 with 30% English, violates level requirements |
| 5-6 | **Acceptable** - Slightly off target | Within 5-10% of target immersion, some unnecessary English or insufficient scaffolding |
| 7-8 | **Good** - Hits target | Within target range, appropriate scaffolding for level, good balance |
| 9-10 | **Excellent** - Optimal immersion | Perfect balance, scaffolding supports without over-translating, ideal for level |

**Target ranges by level:**
- A1.1 (M01-10): 20-40% Ukrainian
- A1.2 (M11-20): 40-60% Ukrainian
- A1.3 (M21-34): 60-80% Ukrainian
- A2: 40-70% Ukrainian
- B1.1 (M01-05): 70-85% Ukrainian (metalanguage bridge)
- B1.2+ (M06-91): 85-100% Ukrainian
- B2, C1, C2: 98-100% Ukrainian

**Example justification:**
> Immersion: 7/10 - Achieves 87% Ukrainian (target 85-100% for B1.2). However, three grammar explanations use English when Ukrainian metalanguage terms exist (e.g., "aspect" instead of "вид дієслова", "perfective" instead of "доконаний вид"). A 9/10 would use Ukrainian metalanguage consistently, supporting learner transition to full immersion.

---

### 7. Activities (0-10)

**What it measures:** Activity quality, density, variety, correct answers, format compliance

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 0-4 | **FAIL** - Broken activities | Wrong answers, broken YAML format, multiple valid answers marked wrong, <minimum activities |
| 5-6 | **Acceptable** - Functional | Meets minimum count, some low density (<14 items), limited variety, answers correct |
| 7-8 | **Good** - Solid activities | Good count (>minimum), all activities ≥14 items, good variety (6+ types), all answers correct |
| 9-10 | **Excellent** - Outstanding | High count, high density (16+ items), exceptional variety (8+ types), creative formats |

**Example justification:**
> Activities: 7/10 - 12 activities (meets B1 minimum), all answers verified correct, good variety (8 types). However, 3 activities have exactly 14 items (minimum density), and mark-the-words activity is too easy (only nouns, no distractors). A 9/10 would increase density to 16+ items and make mark-the-words more challenging (nouns + adjectives that look like nouns).

---

### 8. Richness (0-10)

**What it measures:** Examples, engagement boxes, cultural references, proverbs, dialogues, visuals

**Minimum richness scores (from MODULE-RICHNESS-GUIDELINES-v2.md):**
- Grammar modules: 95%
- Vocabulary modules: 92%
- Cultural modules: 90%
- History modules: 95%
- Integration modules: 88%

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 0-4 | **FAIL** - Below minimum | Richness score <minimum for module type, missing critical elements |
| 5-6 | **Acceptable** - Meets minimum | Richness score at minimum, has required elements but barely, feels thin |
| 7-8 | **Good** - Above minimum | Richness score 5-10% above minimum, solid content, good balance of elements |
| 9-10 | **Excellent** - Rich and varied | Richness score 15%+ above minimum, exceptional variety, memorable content |

**Example justification:**
> Richness: 8/10 - Richness score 98% (grammar module, minimum 95%). Has 32 examples (target 24), 6 engagement boxes (target 5), 12 dialogues (target 4). However, only 2 proverbs (target 3), and engagement boxes are slightly generic ("Did you know Ukrainian has 7 cases?" - obvious fact, not engaging). A 9/10 would add one more specific proverb and replace generic boxes with surprising facts or pop culture connections.

---

### 9. Humanity (0-10)

**What it measures:** Teacher voice, direct address, encouragement, warmth, real-world validation

**Objective thresholds (Section 14 pattern matching):**
- Direct Address: ≥10 instances (ти/ви/твій/ваш/your/let's/we)
- Encouragement: ≥1 instance (Чудово! Молодець! Well done!)
- Anticipation: ≥2 instances (Незабаром побачите, Скоро дізнаєтеся)
- Real-world Validation: ≥1 instance (references to using skills in Ukraine/real contexts)

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 0-4 | **FAIL** - Robotic | Zero direct address, no encouragement, textbook tone, no human voice |
| 5-6 | **Acceptable** - Occasional warmth | 5-9 direct address, minimal encouragement, some personality but inconsistent |
| 7-8 | **Good** - Warm teacher voice | 10-15 direct address, good encouragement, consistent personality, feels human |
| 9-10 | **Excellent** - Exceptional warmth | 20+ direct address, frequent encouragement, memorable personality, inspiring |

**Example justification:**
> Humanity: 7/10 - Direct address: 12 instances (meets threshold). Encouragement: 2 instances ("Чудово! Ви вже майже експерт з виду дієслова!"). Real-world validation: 1 ("Коли ви приїдете в Україну, ви зможете розповісти про свій день українською!"). However, tone is slightly formal/academic in explanation sections. A 9/10 would inject personality into grammar explanations: "Знаєте що? Українці часто помиляються тут теж!" or "Ось маленький секрет, який спростить вам життя..."

---

### 10. LLM Fingerprint (0-10)

**What it measures:** AI-generated content patterns vs. authentic human writing

**Auto-fail patterns (Section 15):**
- ChatGPT default voice (broad, generic, Wikipedia tone)
- Bullet barrage (>50% of content is bullet lists)
- Engagement box faker (>50% boxes just restate content)

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 0-4 | **FAIL** - AI slop | Multiple auto-fail patterns, generic content, zero specificity, obvious AI generation |
| 5-6 | **Acceptable** - Some AI patterns | Occasional generic phrases, limited specificity, feels slightly synthetic |
| 7-8 | **Good** - Mostly authentic | Good specifics, minimal AI patterns, mostly natural voice, some predictability |
| 9-10 | **Excellent** - Human mastery | Zero AI fingerprint, exceptional specificity, unpredictable, authentic cultural voice |

**Key sub-dimensions (Section 13a-13i):**
- AI clichés (embark, delve, tapestry, vibrant, rich)
- False specificity (claims specifics but uses placeholders)
- Certainty overload (everything is definitive, no hedging)
- Anecdotal absence (no personal observations or stories)
- Predictability (can guess next sentence)
- Emotional flatness (describes emotions without evoking them)
- Voice inconsistency (shifts between formal/casual randomly)
- Shallow explanation (correct but surface-level)
- Cultural disconnection (facts without lived experience)

**Example justification:**
> LLM Fingerprint: 8/10 - Zero AI clichés detected. Strong specificity: names actual people (Микола Хвильовий, Mykola Kulish), specific works (Мина Мазайло, Я (Романтика)), exact dates (13 травня 1933). Voice is consistent and engaging. However, one engagement box feels generic: "💡 **Цікавий факт:** Розстріляне відродження - важлива частина української історії." (This is obvious/restates title). A 9/10 would replace with: "💡 **Цікавий факт:** У 1920-х Харків мав більше театрів, ніж Париж. За 10 років НКВД знищив їх усі."

## Overall Score Calculation

**Method 1: Average (Simple)**
```
Overall = (Sum of all 10 dimensions) / 10
```

**Method 2: Weighted (Recommended)**
```
Overall = (
    Coherence × 1.0 +
    Relevance × 1.0 +
    Educational × 1.2 +  // Extra weight: core learning value
    Language × 1.1 +     // Extra weight: Ukrainian quality critical
    Pedagogy × 1.2 +     // Extra weight: teaching approach critical
    Immersion × 0.8 +    // Lower weight: binary (right level or not)
    Activities × 1.3 +   // Extra weight: primary learning tool
    Richness × 0.9 +
    Humanity × 0.8 +
    LLM Fingerprint × 1.1  // Extra weight: AI detection critical for B1+
) / 10.4
```

**Rounding rule:** Round to nearest 0.5 (e.g., 7.3 → 7.0, 7.6 → 8.0, 7.5 → 8.0)

## Calibration Examples

### Example 1: Module scoring 6/10 (Acceptable but weak)

```markdown
**Coherence:** 6/10 - All sections present, but transition from Test to Explanation is jarring. Jumps into grammar without acknowledging test results. A 7/10 would add: "Тепер давайте розберемо правила!"

**Educational:** 7/10 - Explanations are clear but rely heavily on tables. Would benefit from more narrative explanation and fewer lists. Examples are adequate but predictable (Я читав книгу, Ти писав лист).

**Activities:** 6/10 - 10 activities (meets A2 minimum of 10), but 4 activities have only 12 items (below B1 standard of 14). Activity variety is limited (only 5 types). Answers are correct.

**Humanity:** 5/10 - Only 6 direct address instances (below 10 threshold). No encouragement. Feels like a textbook, not a teacher.

**LLM Fingerprint:** 6/10 - One AI cliché detected ("delve into"). Examples lack specificity (generic "book", "letter" instead of "Кобзар", "лист до друга Андрія"). Voice is flat.

**Overall:** 6.2/10 → **6.0/10** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```

### Example 2: Module scoring 8/10 (Good, solid quality)

```markdown
**Coherence:** 8/10 - Strong logical flow. Transition from Test → Teach is smooth ("Чудово! Тепер розберемо, чому..."). Only minor gap: Section 3 to 4 transition could be smoother.

**Educational:** 9/10 - Excellent explanations with memorable analogies (perfective = фото, imperfective = відео). Examples progress well from simple to complex. Only missing edge case: aspect with modal verbs.

**Activities:** 8/10 - 14 activities (above B1 minimum), all ≥14 items, 8 activity types. Good variety. However, cloze activity could be denser (16 items instead of 14).

**Humanity:** 8/10 - 14 direct address, 3 encouragement instances, 2 real-world validations. Warm teacher voice throughout. Could be slightly more playful in tone.

**LLM Fingerprint:** 9/10 - Zero AI clichés. Strong specificity: names Ukrainian authors (Шевченко, Франко), specific works (Кобзар, Захар Беркут), exact page numbers. Authentic voice. One engagement box is slightly generic.

**Overall:** 8.3/10 → **8.5/10** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```

### Example 3: Module scoring 10/10 (Exceptional, reference quality)

```markdown
**Coherence:** 10/10 - Flawless structure. Every section flows naturally into the next. Transitions are seamless and pedagogically motivated. Perfect TTT implementation.

**Educational:** 10/10 - Crystal-clear explanations with innovative analogies. Anticipates every learner confusion. The "time duration = imperfective" rule is explained with visual timeline. Examples are memorable and culturally grounded.

**Activities:** 10/10 - 16 activities (well above minimum), all 16+ items, 10 activity types, exceptional variety. Answers verified correct. Difficulty progression is perfect. Creative activity design (dialogue-reorder uses famous Ukrainian conversation).

**Humanity:** 10/10 - 23 direct address, 5 encouragement, 4 anticipation, 3 real-world validations. Teacher voice is warm, encouraging, occasionally playful. Personality shines: "Ось маленький секрет: навіть носії мови іноді плутають тут!"

**LLM Fingerprint:** 10/10 - Zero AI fingerprint. Exceptional specificity: names specific people (Микола Хвильовий, real biography details), specific locations (будинок «Слово» at Культури площа 9), exact dates (13 травня 1933). Voice is unpredictable, engaging, culturally authentic. Engagement boxes are surprising and memorable (e.g., S.T.A.L.K.E.R. reference connecting game lore to real Ukrainian experiences).

**Overall:** 10.0/10 → **10.0/10** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Why this is 10/10:** This module sets the reference standard. Every element is not just correct but exceptional. It demonstrates innovative pedagogy, deep cultural authenticity, and memorable teaching moments. Other modules should aspire to this quality.
```

## Testing the Scale

**To verify the scale is working:**

1. **Check score distribution** across 10-20 reviewed modules:
   - Expected: Bell curve centered at 7-8
   - Problem: All scores 9-10 (too generous) or all scores 5-6 (too harsh)

2. **Verify differentiation:**
   - A "good" module (7/10) should score clearly lower than "excellent" (9/10)
   - Justifications should explain the difference

3. **Check for score inflation:**
   - Are you giving 9-10 too easily?
   - Do justifications genuinely explain why score is high?

4. **Validate with human judgment:**
   - Does the score "feel right" when you read the module?
   - Would you recommend a 10/10 module as reference quality to other writers?

---

## Common Scoring Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Anchoring to 10/10** - Don't start assuming everything is perfect and deduct points. Start neutral and build up.

2. **Ignoring small issues** - "It's mostly good" → 9/10. NO. If there are issues, score reflects them (7-8/10).

3. **Not using low scores** - If module has problems, give 5-6/10. That's what the scale is for.

4. **Missing justifications** - Every score ≥8 or ≤6 MUST have explanation of what's missing or what makes it exceptional.

5. **Inconsistent standards** - A 7/10 in Coherence should represent similar quality level as 7/10 in Activities.

6. **False equivalence** - "Meets all gates" ≠ automatic 8/10. Gates are minimum (5-6/10). Good quality is 7-8/10. Exceptional is 9-10/10.

---

## Final Reminder

**High scores are earned, not given by default.**

- 10/10 = Exceptional, reference quality, other modules should aspire to this
- 9/10 = Excellent, very few weaknesses, above expectations
- 8/10 = Good, solid quality, minor improvements possible
- 7/10 = Adequate, meets standards, noticeable room for improvement
- 6/10 = Acceptable, passes gates, has several weaknesses
- 5/10 = Barely passing, meets minimum, significant weaknesses
- 0-4/10 = Fail

**If you find yourself giving mostly 9-10s, you're being too generous. Recalibrate.**
