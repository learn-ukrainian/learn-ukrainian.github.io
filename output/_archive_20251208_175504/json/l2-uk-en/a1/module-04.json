No \"am,\" \"is,\" or \"are\"! The verb just disappears. This is called the **zero copula**.\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> Many languages have the zero copula, including Russian, Arabic, and Hungarian. English used to have it too in some dialects! \"You ready?\" instead of \"Are you ready?\" is a trace of this.\n\n### Why No \"To Be\"?\n\nUkrainian doesn't need \"to be\" in the present tense because:\n- The pronoun tells you WHO\n- The noun/adjective tells you WHAT\n- Context does the rest!\n\n## presentation\n\n### Це - The Magic Word for \"This Is\"\n\n**Це** (tse) means \"this is\" or \"it is.\" Use it to identify or point out things:\n\n| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------|\n| Це книга. | Tse knyha. | This is a book. |\n| Це стіл. | Tse stil. | This is a table. |\n| Це мама. | Tse mama. | This is (my) mom. |\n| Це Україна. | Tse Ukraina. | This is Ukraine. |\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip**\n>\n> \"Це\" doesn't change! Unlike \"цей/ця/це\" (this specific one), the identifying \"Це\" stays the same regardless of gender. \"Це книга\" (feminine), \"Це стіл\" (masculine), \"Це вікно\" (neuter) - always just \"Це\"!\n\n### То - The Partner of Це\n\n**То** (to) means \"that is\" for things farther away:\n\n| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------|\n| То дім. | To dim. | That is a house. |\n| То мій друг. | To miy druh. | That is my friend. |\n\n### Personal Pronouns: Who's Who\n\nUkrainian has seven personal pronouns:\n\n| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English | Usage |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------|-------|\n| **я** | ya | I | yourself |\n| **ти** | ty | you (informal) | friends, family, children |\n| **він** | vin | he | males |\n| **вона** | vona | she | females |\n| **воно** | vono | it | things (rare) |\n| **ми** | my | we | group including you |\n| **ви** | vy | you (formal/plural) | strangers, respect, groups |\n| **вони** | vony | they | any group |\n\n> 🎭 **Culture Corner**\n>\n> The ти/ви distinction is important! Use \"ви\" with strangers, older people, bosses, and in formal situations. Use \"ти\" with friends, family, and children. Using \"ти\" with a stranger can be rude, but using \"ви\" with close friends can feel distant!\n\n### Making Identity Sentences\n\nJust put the pronoun and the identity together - no verb needed!\n\n| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------|\n| Я студент. | Ya student. | I am a student. (male) |\n| Я студентка. | Ya studentka. | I am a student. (female) |\n| Ти українець. | Ty ukrainets'. | You are Ukrainian. (male) |\n| Ти українка. | Ty ukrainka. | You are Ukrainian. (female) |\n| Він лікар. | Vin likar. | He is a doctor. |\n| Вона вчителька. | Vona vchytel'ka. | She is a teacher. |\n| Ми студенти. | My studenty. | We are students. |\n| Вони туристи. | Vony turysty. | They are tourists. |\n\n> 🔍 **Myth Buster**\n>\n> **Myth:** \"You can't express 'to be' in Ukrainian\"\n> **Fact:** Ukrainian has the verb \"бути\" (to be), but it's only used in past and future tenses. \"Я був студентом\" (I was a student), \"Вона буде вчителькою\" (She will be a teacher). Present tense just doesn't need it!\n\n### Ось - \"Here is\"\n\n**Ось** (os') means \"here is\" or \"here are\":\n\n| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------|\n| Ось мій паспорт. | Os' miy pasport. | Here is my passport. |\n| Ось вона! | Os' vona! | Here she is! |\n\n### Nationalities: Male vs Female Forms\n\nUkrainian nationalities have different forms for men and women:\n\n| Male | Female | English |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| українець (ukrainets') | українка (ukrainka) | Ukrainian |\n| англієць (anhliets') | англійка (anhliyka) | English person |\n| американець (amerykanets') | американка (amerykanka) | American |\n\n> 📜 **History Bite**\n>\n> The word \"українець\" comes from \"Україна\" (Ukraine). Historically, it meant \"person from the borderland,\" but modern Ukrainians reject this etymology, preferring the interpretation \"person from their own country\" (у + країна = in + country).\n\n### Introducing Yourself\n\nHere's how to introduce yourself:\n\n| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------|\n| Я Марія. | Ya Mariya. | I am Maria. |\n| Мене звати Марія. | Mene zvaty Mariya. | My name is Maria. |\n| Я українка. | Ya ukrainka. | I am Ukrainian. (female) |\n| Я студентка. | Ya studentka. | I am a student. (female) |\n| Я з Києва. | Ya z Kyiva. | I am from Kyiv. |\n\n> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: The Witcher**\n>\n> In the Ukrainian dub of The Witcher, Geralt would say \"Я відьмак\" (Ya vid'mak - I am a witcher). Notice - no \"am\"! Just \"I witcher.\" That's the zero copula in action!\n\n## practice\n\n### Exercise 1: Identify with Це\n\nComplete with the correct word:\n\n1. ___ книга. (This is a book.)\n   > [!answer] Це\n\n2. ___ студент. (He is a student.)\n   > [!answer] Він\n\n3. ___ українка. (She is Ukrainian.)\n   > [!answer] Вона\n\n4. ___ туристи.

(I am a teacher - female)\n   > [!answer] Я\n\n### Exercise 2: Translate\n\nTranslate to Ukrainian (no verb needed!):\n\n1. I am a student. (male)\n   > [!answer] Я студент.\n\n2. She is a doctor.\n   > [!answer] Вона лікар. (or лікарка)\n\n3. This is a window.\n   > [!answer] Це вікно.\n\n4. We are Ukrainian.\n   > [!answer] Ми українці.\n\n5. You are a tourist. (formal, male)\n   > [!answer] Ви турист.\n\n6. They are students.\n   > [!answer] Вони студенти.\n\n## production\n\n### Introduce Yourself\n\nPractice these sentences about yourself:\n\n1. **Я ___** (Your name)\n2. **Я з ___** (Your country/city)\n3. **Я ___** (Your profession/status)\n\nExample:\n- Я Джон. (Ya Dzhon.)\n- Я з Лондона. (Ya z Londona.)\n- Я студент. (Ya student.)\n\n> 🌍 **Real World**\n>\n> When you meet Ukrainians, they'll often ask \"Звідки ви?\" (Where are you from?) Your answer: \"Я з...\" + city/country. No verb needed!\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---"
