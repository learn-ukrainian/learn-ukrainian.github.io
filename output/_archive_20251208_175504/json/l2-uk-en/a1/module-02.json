By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to read ANY Ukrainian word!\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> Ukrainian has 33 letters - one more than Russian (which has 32). The extra letter is **Ґ** - a sound that was banned during Soviet times but has been restored in independent Ukraine!\n\n### What's Left to Learn?\n\nWe have four groups of letters remaining:\n\n| Group | Letters | Description |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| **Unique Sounds** | Г, Ґ, Ж, Ш, Щ, Ч, Ц | Sounds not in English |\n| **Iotated Vowels** | Є, Ї, Ю, Я | Vowels with a \"y\" prefix |\n| **Hard I** | И | Between /i/ and /ɪ/ |\n| **Soft Sign** | Ь | Makes previous consonant soft |\n\nLet's crack the rest of the code!\n\n## presentation\n\n### Unique Ukrainian Sounds\n\nThese letters represent sounds that don't have exact English equivalents, but you'll pick them up quickly!\n\n| Letter | Sound | How to Say It | Example |\n|--------|-------|---------------|---------|\n| **Г г** | /ɦ/ | breathy H (like sighing) | **г**арно (harno) - good/nice |\n| **Ґ ґ** | /g/ | hard G like \"**g**o\" | **ґ**анок (ganok) - porch |\n| **Ж ж** | /ʒ/ | like \"mea**s**ure\" | **ж**урнал (zhurnal) - magazine |\n| **Ш ш** | /ʃ/ | like \"**sh**oe\" | **ш**кола (shkola) - school |\n| **Щ щ** | /ʃtʃ/ | \"sh\" + \"ch\" together | **щ**о (shcho) - what |\n| **Ч ч** | /tʃ/ | like \"**ch**urch\" | **ч**ай (chai) - tea |\n| **Ц ц** | /ts/ | like \"ca**ts**\" | **ц**е (tse) - this |\n\n> 🔍 **Myth Buster**\n>\n> **Myth:** \"Ukrainian Г is just like Russian Г\"\n> **Fact:** Ukrainian Г is a soft, breathy /ɦ/ sound, while Russian Г is a hard /g/. The hard G sound in Ukrainian uses the special letter **Ґ** - one of Ukraine's unique letters that was suppressed during Soviet rule!\n\n### The \"Hard I\": И\n\nThis vowel sits between English \"i\" in \"bit\" and \"ee\" in \"beet\":\n\n| Letter | Sound | Example |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| **И и** | /ɪ/ | like \"b**i**t\" (short) | в**и**бачте (vybachte) - excuse me |\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip**\n>\n> Think of **И** as the \"hard\" version of **І**:\n> - **І** = clear \"ee\" (machine)\n> - **И** = shorter, harder \"i\" (bit)\n\n### Iotated Vowels: The \"Y\" Family\n\nThese vowels start with a /j/ sound (like English \"y\") before the vowel:\n\n| Letter | Sound | Breakdown | Example |\n|--------|-------|-----------|---------|\n| **Є є** | /jɛ/ | \"y\" + \"e\" | **Є**вропа (Yevropa) - Europe |\n| **Ї ї** | /ji/ | \"y\" + \"ee\" | **ї**сти (yisty) - to eat |\n| **Ю ю** | /ju/ | \"y\" + \"oo\" | **ю**рист (yurist) - lawyer |\n| **Я я** | /ja/ | \"y\" + \"a\" | **я** (ya) - I |\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> The letter **Ї** exists ONLY in Ukrainian - no other Slavic language has it! It's used in words like Україна (Ukraina) and їсти (yisty - to eat). This letter is a symbol of Ukrainian linguistic uniqueness!\n\n### The Soft Sign: Ь\n\nThe soft sign doesn't make a sound itself. Instead, it makes the consonant before it \"soft\" (palatalized):\n\n| Without Ь | With Ь | Difference |\n|-----------|--------|------------|\n| кон (kon) | конь (kon') | horse (soft n) |\n| мат (mat) | мать → мати (maty) | mother (historical) |\n\n> 🎯 **Fun Fact**\n>\n> The soft sign **Ь** is like a \"silent softener.\" When you see it after a consonant, touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth as you say the consonant - that's palatalization!\n\n### ⚠️ ITALIC WARNING: Letters That Change Shape!\n\nWhen Ukrainian text is in *italics*, some letters look completely different! This catches many learners by surprise:\n\n| Print | Italic | Looks Like | Watch Out! |\n|-------|--------|------------|------------|\n| **т** | *т* | m | Don't confuse with М! |\n| **п** | *п* | n | Don't confuse with Н! |\n| **д** | *д* | g | Completely different! |\n| **и** | *и* | u | Don't confuse with У! |\n| **л** | *л* | hook/л | Rounded at bottom |\n| **г** | *г* | ∂ | Like partial delta |\n\n> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: The Witcher**\n>\n> \"Відьмак\" (The Witcher) in italic would be \"*Відьмак*\" - notice how the letters change shape! When you see Ukrainian game menus or film credits in italics, remember this warning!\n\n### Let's Practice: Full Alphabet Reading\n\nNow you can read ANY Ukrainian word! Try these common phrases:\n\n| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------|\n| так | tak | yes |\n| ні | ni | no |\n| добре | dobre | good/okay |\n| дякую | dyakuyu | thank you |\n| будь ласка | bud' laska | please |\n| привіт | pryvit | hello (informal) |\n| до побачення | do pobachennya | goodbye |\n| вибачте | vybachte | excuse me |\n| прошу | proshu | you're welcome/please |\n| що | shcho | what |\n| як | yak | how |\n| де | de | where |\n| хто | khto | who |\n| ласкаво просимо | laskavo prosymo | welcome |\n\n> 🌍 **Real World**\n>\n> These are the first words you'll hear and need in Ukraine! \"Дякую\" (thank you) and \"Будь ласка\" (please) will get you far in any interaction.\n\n### The Complete Ukrainian Alphabet\n\nHere's your complete reference - all 33 letters!\n\n| А Б В Г Ґ Д Е Є Ж З И І Ї Й К Л М Н О П Р С Т У Ф Х Ц Ч Ш Щ Ь Ю Я |\n\n> 📜 **History Bite**\n>\n> Ukrainian was once called \"Little Russian\" by imperial powers who wanted to suppress it.
