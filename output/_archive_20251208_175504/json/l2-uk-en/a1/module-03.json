A table (стіл) is masculine, a book (книга) is feminine, and a window (вікно) is neuter.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because adjectives, pronouns, and even verbs change their endings to match the noun's gender. Learning gender now will make everything else easier!\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> English used to have grammatical gender too! Words like \"sun\" were feminine and \"moon\" was masculine in Old English. Ukrainian kept this feature - and it makes the language more expressive!\n\n### The Good News\n\nUnlike German (where you must memorize each word's gender), Ukrainian gender is **predictable from the ending** in most cases:\n\n| Ending | Gender | Example |\n|--------|--------|---------|\n| Consonant | Masculine | сті**л** (stіl) - table |\n| **-а/-я** | Feminine | книг**а** (knyha) - book |\n| **-о/-е** | Neuter | вікн**о** (vikno) - window |\n\n## presentation\n\n### Masculine Nouns: Consonant Endings\n\nMasculine nouns typically end in a consonant (no vowel at the end):\n\n| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------|\n| стіл | stil | table |\n| дім | dim | house |\n| хліб | khlib | bread |\n| чай | chai | tea |\n| сік | sik | juice |\n| огірок | ohirok | cucumber |\n| помідор | pomidor | tomato |\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip**\n>\n> If a noun ends in a consonant sound, it's almost always masculine. The letter Й counts as a consonant here: чай (chai - tea) is masculine!\n\n### Feminine Nouns: -а/-я Endings\n\nFeminine nouns typically end in **-а** or **-я**:\n\n| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------|\n| книга | knyha | book |\n| кімната | kimnata | room |\n| вода | voda | water |\n| риба | ryba | fish |\n| картопля | kartoplya | potato |\n| цибуля | tsybulya | onion |\n| річка | richka | river |\n\n> 🎯 **Fun Fact**\n>\n> The word \"Україна\" (Ukraine) is feminine! That's why Ukrainians say \"моя Україна\" (my Ukraine) - with the feminine possessive. The country is often personified as a mother figure in Ukrainian culture.\n\n### Neuter Nouns: -о/-е Endings\n\nNeuter nouns typically end in **-о** or **-е**:\n\n| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------|\n| вікно | vikno | window |\n| місто | misto | city |\n| село | selo | village |\n| море | more | sea |\n| молоко | moloko | milk |\n| м'ясо | myaso | meat |\n| яблуко | yabluko | apple |\n\n> 🔍 **Myth Buster**\n>\n> **Myth:** \"Neuter gender is rare in Ukrainian\"\n> **Fact:** Neuter is very common! Many everyday words are neuter: місто (city), село (village), море (sea), молоко (milk). Don't ignore this gender!\n\n### The Gender Decision Tree\n\n```\nLook at the ending:\n│\n├── Consonant (including Й)? → MASCULINE (стіл, дім, чай)\n├── -а or -я? → FEMININE (книга, вода, земля)\n└── -о or -е? → NEUTER (вікно, море, яблуко)\n```\n\n### Irregular Genders: Words That Break the Rules\n\nSome words don't follow the pattern. Memorize these exceptions:\n\n| Word | Expected | Actual | Why |\n|------|----------|--------|-----|\n| тато (tato) | neuter? | **masculine** | Refers to a male |\n| батько (batko) | neuter? | **masculine** | Refers to a male |\n| дідусь (didus') | feminine? | **masculine** | Refers to a male |\n| двері (dveri) | feminine? | **plural** | Always plural in Ukrainian |\n\n> 📜 **History Bite**\n>\n> Words for family members often break gender rules because the gender follows the person, not the ending. \"Тато\" (dad) ends in -о but is masculine because it refers to a male person.\n\n### The Four Declension Families\n\nUkrainian nouns belong to four \"families\" based on how they change (decline) in different cases. For now, just know they exist:\n\n| Family | Pattern | Example |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| **1st** | -а/-я feminines | книг**а**, земл**я** |\n| **2nd** | Consonant M + -о/-е N | стіл, вікн**о** |\n| **3rd** | Soft feminines | ніч, радіст**ь** |\n| **4th** | -а masculines | тат**о**, суддя |\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> The declension family determines what endings a noun takes in different cases (which you'll learn in later modules). But for now, gender is enough - most endings follow predictable patterns!\n\n### Gender in Action\n\nHere's why gender matters - notice how \"this\" changes:\n\n| Gender | \"This\" | Example |\n|--------|--------|---------|\n| Masculine | це**й** | Цей стіл (This table) |\n| Feminine | ц**я** | Ця книга (This book) |\n| Neuter | ц**е** | Це вікно (This window) |\n\nWe'll explore this more in Module 05!\n\n## practice\n\n### Exercise 1: Gender Identification\n\nWhat gender is each word?\n\n1. стіл\n   > [!answer] Masculine (ends in consonant)\n\n2. книга\n   > [!answer] Feminine (ends in -а)\n\n3. вікно\n   > [!answer] Neuter (ends in -о)\n\n4. вода\n   > [!answer] Feminine (ends in -а)\n\n5. хліб\n   > [!answer] Masculine (ends in consonant)\n\n6. море\n   > [!answer] Neuter (ends in -е)\n\n### Exercise 2: Predict the Gender\n\nBefore checking, predict based on the ending:\n\n1. яблуко (apple)\n   > [!answer] Neuter (-о ending)\n\n2. картопля (potato)\n   > [!answer] Feminine (-я ending)\n\n3. чай (tea)\n   > [!answer] Masculine (consonant Й)\n\n4. молоко (milk)\n   > [!answer] Neuter (-о ending)\n\n5. риба (fish)\n   > [!answer] Feminine (-а ending)\n\n6. сік (juice)\n   > [!answer] Masculine (consonant)\n\n## production\n\n### Sorting Practice\n\nLook around your room. In Ukrainian, can you identify:\n- 3 masculine objects (ending in consonant)\n- 3 feminine objects (ending in -а/-я)\n- 3 neuter objects (ending in -о/-е)\n\n> 🌍 **Real World**\n>\n> Next time you're in a Ukrainian restaurant, notice the menu items! Борщ (borshch) is masculine, риба (ryba - fish) is feminine, and м'ясо (myaso - meat) is neuter. You're already reading gender!\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---"
