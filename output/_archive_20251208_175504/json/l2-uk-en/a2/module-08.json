Mastering the case system is like unlocking Ukrainian's secret code — once you can choose the right case instinctively, you'll understand and be understood everywhere from Kyiv cafés to Lviv marketplaces.\n\nThink of cases as relationship markers. Each case tells you what role a word plays in the sentence: Is it doing the action? Receiving something? Being used as a tool? The beauty of the system is its precision — there's never ambiguity about who did what to whom.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you'll be able to confidently choose the right case for any situation.\n\n---"

(брат) | Accusative (direct object) |\n| Це машина ___. (тато) | Genitive (possession) |\n| Дай це ___. (мама) | Dative (recipient) |\n| Я йду з ___. (друг) | Instrumental (accompaniment) |\n| Він у ___. (магазин) | Locative (location) |\n\n---\n\n# Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct |\n|---------|----------------|---------|\n| Я йду **в магазині** | Locative = where you ARE, not where you're GOING | Я йду **в магазин** (Acc) |\n| Даю книгу **мама** | Recipients need dative, not nominative | Даю книгу **мамі** (Dat) |\n| Немає **час** | Absence requires genitive | Немає **часу** (Gen) |\n| Пишу **ручка** | Tools need instrumental | Пишу **ручкою** (Inst) |\n| **Тарас**, йди! | Direct address needs vocative | **Тарасе**, йди! (Voc) |\n\n> [!tip] 🎯 Fun Fact\n> The most common case confusion is between accusative and locative with direction words. Remember: **В магазин** (I'm going TO) vs **В магазині** (I'm AT). The ending change is small, but the meaning is completely different!\n\n---\n\n# Mixed Practice Sentences\n\nLet's analyze sentences that use multiple cases together:\n\n- **Брат** дає **сестрі** **книгу**. (Nom + Dat + Acc)\n  - *Brother (doer) gives sister (recipient) a book (object)*\n- Я пишу **ручкою** лист **мамі**. (Inst + Dat)\n  - *I write with a pen a letter to mom*\n- **Студент** читає **в бібліотеці**. (Nom + Loc)\n  - *Student (doer) reads in the library (location)*\n- У **тата** є **машина**. (Gen + Nom)\n  - *At dad's (possession) there is a car (subject)*\n- Ми йдемо **з друзями** **в кіно**. (Inst + Acc)\n  - *We go with friends (companion) to the cinema (direction)*\n\n> [!tip] 💡 Did You Know?\n> A single sentence can contain 3-4 different cases! Each word has its role to play. Professional writers and poets sometimes construct sentences using all seven cases — a linguistic feat!\n\n---\n\n# Common Patterns Summary\n\n| Pattern | Example |\n|---------|---------|\n| Subject + Verb | Брат читає. |\n| Verb + Direct Object | Бачу брата. |\n| Give + Dat + Acc | Даю братові книгу. |\n| With + Inst | З братом. |\n| In/At + Loc | В магазині. |\n| Of/From + Gen | Від брата. |\n| Hey + Voc | Брате! |\n\n---\n\n# Vocabulary\n\n| Word | IPA | English | POS | Gender | Note |\n|------|-----|---------|-----|--------|------|\n| називний | /nazɪwˈnɪj/ | nominative | adj | m | case name |\n| родовий | /rodoˈwɪj/ | genitive | adj | m | case name |\n| давальний | /daˈwalʲnɪj/ | dative | adj | m | case name |\n| знахідний | /znaˈxidnɪj/ | accusative | adj | m | case name |\n| орудний | /oˈrudnɪj/ | instrumental | adj | m | case name |\n| місцевий | /misˈt͡sɛwɪj/ | locative | adj | m | case name |\n| кличний | /ˈklɪtʃnɪj/ | vocative | adj | m | case name |\n| відмінок | /widˈminok/ | case (grammar) | noun | m | |\n| речення | /ˈrɛtʃɛnʲːa/ | sentence | noun | n | |\n| підмет | /ˈpidmɛt/ | subject | noun | m | |\n| присудок | /prɪˈsudok/ | predicate | noun | m | |\n| додаток | /doˈdatok/ | object | noun | m | |\n| склянка | /ˈsklʲanka/ | glass | noun | f | |\n| лист | /lɪst/ | letter | noun | m | |\n| бібліотека | /bibliˈotɛka/ | library | noun | f | |\n| магазин | /maɦaˈzɪn/ | store | noun | m | |\n| вечеря | /weˈtʃɛrʲa/ | dinner | noun | f | |\n| час | /tʃas/ | time | noun | m | |\n| кіно | /kiˈno/ | cinema | noun | n | indecl. |\n| слава | /ˈslawa/ | glory | noun | f | |\n| офіціант | /ofit͡siˈant/ | waiter | noun | m | |\n| рахунок | /raˈxunok/ | bill, account | noun | m | |\n| вокзал | /wokˈzal/ | train station | noun | m | |\n| фонтан | /fonˈtan/ | fountain | noun | m | |\n| сусід | /suˈsid/ | neighbor | noun | m | |\n| подвір'я | /podˈwirja/ | yard, courtyard | noun | n | |\n| кілограм | /kiloˈɦram/ | kilogram | noun | m | |\n| цукор | /ˈt͡sukor/ | sugar | noun | m | |\n| ложка | /ˈloʒka/ | spoon | noun | f | |\n| стіна | /stiˈna/ | wall | noun | f | |\n\n---\n\n# Activities\n\n## fill-in: Choose the Correct Case Form\n\n1.
