Тільки **між нами** — він дуже суворий...\n\n---\n\n# Locative Case Prepositions (Місцевий)\n\nThe locative (also called prepositional) case ONLY appears with prepositions — that's its superpower:\n\n| Preposition | Meaning | Example |\n|-------------|---------|---------|\n| **в/у** | in (location) | в магазині (in the store) |\n| **на** | on, at (location) | на роботі (at work) |\n| **по** | on, along, after | по телефону (on the phone) |\n| **при** | at, by, near | при вході (at the entrance) |\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> **По** is tricky — it takes LOCATIVE for most meanings (*по телефону*, *по дорозі*), but there's also *по* with ACCUSATIVE for distribution (*по яблуку кожному* = an apple to each). Most commonly, you'll use it with locative.\n\n---\n\n# The Great Direction vs. Location Split\n\nThis is perhaps the most important pattern in Ukrainian prepositions. The SAME preposition can take different cases depending on whether you're expressing movement (direction) or position (location):\n\n| Direction (Куди?) | Location (Де?) |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Я йду **в магазин** (Acc). | Я **в магазині** (Loc). |\n| Він іде **на роботу** (Acc). | Він **на роботі** (Loc). |\n| Поклади **під стіл** (Acc). | Лежить **під столом** (Inst). |\n| Сядь **за стіл** (Acc). | Він сидить **за столом** (Inst). |\n| Повісь **над столом** (Inst). | Висить **над столом** (Inst). |\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: над and під**\n>\n> Unlike в/на, the prepositions **над** (above) and **під** (under) now primarily use **Instrumental** for both direction AND location in modern Ukrainian. You may see Accusative in older texts or literary language, but for everyday speech, stick with Instrumental!\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: The Two Questions**\n>\n> - **Куди?** (Where to?) → Accusative (direction)\n> - **Де?** (Where?) → Locative/Instrumental (location)\n>\n> Ask yourself which question the preposition phrase answers, and you'll always know the right case!\n\n**🎭 Де кіт? (Where's the Cat?)**\n\n— Де кіт?\n— Не знаю... Може, **під столом**?\n— Ні, його там немає.\n— А **за диваном**? Він любить ховатися **за диваном**.\n— Ні...\n— О! Дивись! Він біжить **під ліжко**!\n— А тепер сидить **під ліжком** і дивиться на нас...\n\n---\n\n# З/Із — The Chameleon Preposition\n\n**З** is unique — it completely changes meaning based on the case it takes:\n\n| Case | Meaning | Example |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| **Genitive** | from (origin) | **з** України (from Ukraine) |\n| **Instrumental** | with (accompaniment) | **з** братом (with brother) |\n\n> 🌍 **Real World: \"Звідки ви?\"**\n>\n> When Ukrainians ask *Звідки ви?* (Where are you from?), your answer uses **з + genitive**:\n> - *Я з Києва* (I'm from Kyiv)\n> - *Я з Канади* (I'm from Canada)\n> - *Я з маленького села* (I'm from a small village)\n\n**When to use \"із\" vs \"з\":**\n- Use **із** before words starting with з, с, ш, щ: *із сестрою*, *із Закарпаття*\n- Use **зі** before мн, лл, and some consonant clusters: *зі мною*, *зі Львова*\n- Otherwise, **з** works everywhere: *з братом*, *з України*\n\n---\n\n# На vs. В/У — The Big Choice\n\nThis distinction confuses even advanced learners. Here's the pattern:\n\n| Use **на** | Use **в/у** |\n|------------|-------------|\n| на Україні (in Ukraine) | в Італії (in Italy) |\n| на роботі (at work) | в офісі (in the office) |\n| на вокзалі (at the station) | в аеропорту (in the airport) |\n| на вулиці (on the street) | в магазині (in the store) |\n| на пошті (at the post office) | в банку (in the bank) |\n| на заводі (at the factory) | в ресторані (in the restaurant) |\n| на кухні (in the kitchen) | в кімнаті (in the room) |\n| на концерті (at the concert) | в театрі (in the theater) |\n\n> 📜 **History Bite: На Україні vs. В Україні**\n>\n> This is a sensitive topic. Historically, *на Україні* was used when Ukraine was a region within an empire. Since independence, many Ukrainians prefer *в Україні* to emphasize Ukraine's status as an independent country, not a borderland (*край*). Both forms exist in modern usage, but *в Україні* is increasingly preferred in official contexts. As a learner, be aware of both — and follow the preference of native speakers you interact with.\n\n**General rule of thumb:**\n- **На** = open spaces, surfaces, events, and some traditional locations\n- **В/у** = enclosed spaces, buildings, and most countries\n\n---\n\n# Common Preposition Phrases\n\nThese fixed expressions are essential for fluent Ukrainian:\n\n| Ukrainian | Literal | English Meaning |\n|-----------|---------|-----------------|\n| без сумніву | without doubt | undoubtedly |\n| до побачення | to seeing | goodbye |\n| до речі | to the matter | by the way |\n| після обіду | after lunch | in the afternoon |\n| перед сном | before sleep | before bedtime |\n| під час | under time | during |\n| на жаль | on pity | unfortunately |\n| за кордоном | behind the border | abroad |\n| між іншим | between other | by the way |\n| ні за що | not for anything | you're welcome / no way |\n| на мою думку | on my thought | in my opinion |\n| без перебільшення | without exaggeration | no exaggeration |\n\n> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: \"За кордоном\"**\n>\n> The phrase *за кордоном* (abroad, literally \"behind the border\") became hugely significant after 2022 when millions of Ukrainians found themselves living *за кордоном*. It appears in countless songs, poems, and social media posts about the diaspora experience.\n\n---\n\n# Practice Sentences\n\nRead these sentences aloud, paying attention to preposition + case combinations:\n\n1.
