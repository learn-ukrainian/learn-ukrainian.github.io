        "content": "Welcome to your first A2 checkpoint! You've completed Phase A2.1: Completing the Cases. This is a major milestone — you now know all seven Ukrainian cases, the foundation of the entire language.\n\nThink about how far you've come: In A1, you learned nominative (subject), genitive (possession), accusative (direct object), locative (location), and vocative (address). In A2.1, you added dative (recipient) and instrumental (tools, companions, professions). You can now express almost any relationship between words!\n\nWhy does this matter? Because cases are how Ukrainian shows *who does what to whom*. In English, word order is rigid: \"The dog bit the man\" means something completely different from \"The man bit the dog.\" But in Ukrainian, thanks to cases, you can rearrange words for emphasis while keeping the meaning clear. *Собака вкусив чоловіка* and *Чоловіка вкусив собака* both mean the same thing — the dog did the biting — because the accusative ending on *чоловіка* marks him as the victim regardless of position.\n\nNow let's review everything and make sure it's solid before moving on.\n\n---"

You've completed Phase A2.1: Completing the Cases. This is a major milestone — you now know all seven Ukrainian cases, the foundation of the entire language.\n\nThink about how far you've come: In A1, you learned nominative (subject), genitive (possession), accusative (direct object), locative (location), and vocative (address). In A2.1, you added dative (recipient) and instrumental (tools, companions, professions). You can now express almost any relationship between words!\n\nWhy does this matter? Because cases are how Ukrainian shows *who does what to whom*. In English, word order is rigid: \"The dog bit the man\" means something completely different from \"The man bit the dog.\" But in Ukrainian, thanks to cases, you can rearrange words for emphasis while keeping the meaning clear. *Собака вкусив чоловіка* and *Чоловіка вкусив собака* both mean the same thing — the dog did the biting — because the accusative ending on *чоловіка* marks him as the victim regardless of position.\n\nNow let's review everything and make sure it's solid before moving on.\n\n---\n\n# Phase A2.1 Review\n\n## What You've Learned\n\n| Module | Topic | Key Concept |\n|--------|-------|-------------|\n| 1 | Dative Pronouns | мені, тобі, йому, їй, нам, вам, їм |\n| 2 | Dative Nouns | -ові/-у (m), -і (f), -у/-ю (n) |\n| 3 | Dative Verbs | допомагати, дякувати, вірити + dat |\n| 4 | Instrumental I | з + inst. for accompaniment |\n| 5 | Instrumental II | bare inst. for tools & means |\n| 6 | Being & Becoming | бути, стати + instrumental |\n| 7 | Prepositions | all preposition + case combos |\n| 8 | All Cases | the complete 7-case system |\n| 9 | Post Office & Bank | practical vocabulary |\n\n---\n\n# Quick Reference: Dative\n\nThe dative case answers the question **Кому? Чому?** (To whom? To what?) — it marks the *recipient* of an action. When you give something, tell something, or show something TO someone, that someone goes into dative. Think of dative as the \"receiving end\" of generosity, communication, or attention.\n\n## Pronouns\n\n| Nominative | Dative |\n|------------|--------|\n| я | мені |\n| ти | тобі |\n| він | йому |\n| вона | їй |\n| ми | нам |\n| ви | вам |\n| вони | їм |\n\nNotice the pattern: most dative pronouns end in **-і** or have a distinctive form. *Мені* and *тобі* are easy to remember — they rhyme!

This isn't a strict rule, but it's the natural pattern most Ukrainians follow.\n\n---\n\n# Quick Reference: Instrumental\n\nThe instrumental case answers the question **Ким? Чим?** (By whom? With what?) — it marks *tools, means, and companions*. When you do something WITH a tool, travel BY a vehicle, or go somewhere WITH a person, you use instrumental. It's also the case of identity: what you ARE or BECOME (*бути лікарем* — to be a doctor).\n\n## Pronouns\n\n| Nominative | Instrumental |\n|------------|--------------|\n| я | мною |\n| ти | тобою |\n| він | ним |\n| вона | нею |\n| ми | нами |\n| ви | вами |\n| вони | ними |\n\nThe instrumental pronouns have distinctive endings: **-ою** for *тобою*, **-ами** for *нами/вами*, and short forms for third person (*ним, нею, ними*). After prepositions like *з*, the third person forms add an *н-*: *з ним, з нею, з ними*.\n\n## Noun Endings\n\n| Gender | Ending | Example |\n|--------|--------|---------|\n| Masculine | -ом/-ем | братом, учителем |\n| Feminine | -ою/-ею | сестрою, землею |\n| Neuter | -ом/-ем | молоком, морем |\n| Plural | -ами/-ями | братами, друзями |\n\nThe endings are remarkably consistent: masculine and neuter share **-ом/-ем**, feminine uses **-ою/-ею**, and plural always ends in **-ами/-ями**. If the stem ends in a soft consonant or *й*, use the softer variant (*-ем, -ею, -ями*).\n\n---\n\n# Two Uses of Instrumental\n\nThe instrumental case has two main functions, and the key difference is whether you use a preposition:\n\n| Use | Preposition | Example |\n|-----|-------------|---------|\n| Accompaniment | **з** | з братом (with brother) |\n| Tool/Means | none | ручкою (with a pen) |\n\n**Accompaniment** (*з + instrumental*): Use this when someone or something accompanies you. *Я йду з другом* (I'm going with a friend). *Кава з молоком* (Coffee with milk).

Ukrainian's seven is the \"classic\" Slavic set.\n\n---\n\n# When to Use Dative vs Instrumental\n\nThis is the question learners ask most often: \"How do I know which case to use?\" Here's a decision guide:\n\n## Use DATIVE when...\n\n| Situation | Example | Why Dative? |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| Someone receives something | Даю книгу **братові** | Recipient of giving |\n| Verbs require it | Допомагаю **мамі** | Verb governs dative |\n| Impersonal expressions | **Мені** холодно | Experiencer of state |\n| Thanking someone | Дякую **вам** | Recipient of thanks |\n| Something belongs | Це належить **їй** | Owner/possessor |\n\n**Key dative verbs to memorize:** допомагати, дякувати, вірити, довіряти, заважати, належати, шкодити, личити\n\n## Use INSTRUMENTAL when...\n\n| Situation | Example | Why Instrumental? |\n|-----------|---------|-------------------|\n| WITH someone (accompaniment) | Йду **з другом** | Companion (needs з) |\n| WITH something (tool) | Пишу **ручкою** | Tool/means (no prep) |\n| BY vehicle | Їду **поїздом** | Means of transport |\n| AS profession | Працює **лікарем** | Professional identity |\n| BECOMING something | Стала **вчителькою** | Transformation |\n\n**Key distinction:** If you can say \"using\" or \"by means of\" → bare instrumental. If you mean \"accompanied by\" → з + instrumental.\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n| Wrong | Right | Why |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| *Допомагаю братом | Допомагаю **братові** | допомагати needs dative |\n| *Йду з брат | Йду **з братом** | з needs instrumental |\n| *Пишу з ручкою | Пишу **ручкою** | Tool = bare instrumental |\n| *Він лікарем | Він **лікар** (present) | Present tense = nominative |\n| *Він був лікар | Він був **лікарем** | Past tense = instrumental |\n\n---\n\n# Review: Key Words from Phase A2.1\n\n## Dative Verbs (Module 3)\n\nдопомагати, заважати, дякувати, вірити, довіряти, вибачати, належати, шкодити, личити, давати, показувати, пояснювати\n\n## Instrumental (Modules 4-5)\n\nручка, олівець, ніж, виделка, ложка, машина, автобус, поїзд, літак, велосипед\n\n## Professions (Module 6)\n\nлікар/лікарка, вчитель/вчителька, інженер, програміст/програмістка, актор/актриса, журналіст/журналістка\n\n## Post Office & Bank (Module 9)\n\nпошта, лист, марка, конверт, посилка, банк, рахунок, картка, гроші, готівка, валюта, курс\n\n---\n\n# Vocabulary\n\n| Word | IPA | English | POS | Gender | Note |\n|------|-----|---------|-----|--------|------|\n| відмінок | /widˈminok/ | grammatical case | noun | m | |\n| давальний | /daˈwalʲnɪj/ | dative | adj | m | case name |\n| орудний | /oˈrudnɪj/ | instrumental | adj | m | case name |\n| закінчення | /zaˈkintʃɛnʲːa/ | ending | noun | n | |\n| допомагати | /dopomaˈɦatɪ/ | to help | verb | — | + dat |\n| дякувати | /dʲaˈkuwatɪ/ | to thank | verb | — | + dat |\n| стати | /ˈstatɪ/ | to become | verb | — | + inst |\n| залишатися | /zalɪˈʃatɪsʲa/ | to remain | verb | — | + inst |\n| з | /z/ | with | prep | — | + inst |\n| зі | /zi/ | with | prep | — | before мною |\n| лікар | /ˈlikar/ | doctor | noun | m | |\n| вчитель | /wˈtʃɪtelʲ/ | teacher | noun | m | |\n| рахунок | /raˈxunok/ | account | noun | m | |\n| картка | /ˈkartka/ | card | noun | f | |\n| гроші | /ˈɦroʃi/ | money | noun | pl | |\n| посилка | /poˈsɪlka/ | package | noun | f | |\n| марка | /ˈmarka/ | stamp | noun | f | |\n| переказ | /pɛrɛˈkaz/ | transfer | noun | m | |\n| валюта | /waˈlʲuta/ | currency | noun | f | |\n| курс | /kurs/ | rate | noun | m | |\n\n---\n\n# Activities\n\n## fill-in: Mixed Case Practice\n\n1.
