Verbs like \"lufian\" (to love) had perfective forms with prefixes, just like Ukrainian. Over centuries, English simplified, dropping most prefixes and losing the aspect distinction. Modern English speakers use words like \"finished,\" \"kept on,\" or \"used to\" to express what Ukrainian does with a single verb form.\n\nThink of it like photography: **imperfective** is a video — capturing the ongoing action. **Perfective** is a snapshot — capturing the completed moment.\n\n---"
