        "content": "## Warm-up\n\n### Your voice matters\n\nUntil now, you've been learning to describe things — what exists, what happened, where to go. But at B1 level, you need to be able to say **what you think**.\n\nIs learning languages difficult? What's the best season? Is it better to live in a city or a village?\n\nThere's no \"right\" answer to these questions. There's only your **думка** (opinion). Today you'll learn to express it — clearly, politely, persuasively.\n\n> 💡 **Did you know?**\n>\n> In Ukrainian culture, a **justified** opinion is highly valued. A simple \"I think so\" usually isn't enough — an explanation with \"because...\" is expected. This differs from some cultures where simply stating your position is sufficient. When a Ukrainian asks \"чому?\" (why?) after your opinion — it's not a challenge, but an invitation to a deeper conversation!\n\n---\n\n## Presentation\n\n### Expressing opinions\n\nUkrainian has many ways to express opinions, ranging from casual to formal:\n\n**Direct expressions:**\n\n| Ukrainian | English | Register |\n|-----------|---------|----------|\n| Я думаю, що... | I think that... | neutral |\n| Я вважаю, що... | I consider/believe that... | neutral-formal |\n| Я гадаю, що... | I think/suppose that... | neutral |\n| На мою думку, ... | In my opinion, ... | neutral |\n| На мій погляд, ... | In my view, ... | formal |\n| З моєї точки зору, ... | From my point of view, ... | formal |\n| Мені здається, що... | It seems to me that... | softer |\n| Як на мене, ... | As for me, ... | informal |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Я думаю**, що це гарна ідея. — I think it's a good idea.\n- **Я вважаю**, що він має рацію. — I believe he's right.\n- **На мою думку**, це найкраще рішення. — In my opinion, this is the best solution.\n- **Мені здається**, що ми помиляємося. — It seems to me we're wrong.\n- **Як на мене**, це занадто дорого. — As for me, it's too expensive.\n\n> 🔍 **Myth vs Fact**\n>\n> ❌ **Myth:** \"Думати and вважати are the same.\"\n>\n> ✅ **Fact:** There's a subtle difference! **Думати** is the general, neutral option. **Вважати** is slightly stronger, implying a considered position. \"Я думаю, буде дощ\" (spontaneous) vs \"Я вважаю, що освіта важлива\" (considered position). In formal contexts (work, presentations), вважати sounds more professional.\n\n### Expressing certainty\n\nWhen you're confident about something, use these expressions:\n\n**High certainty:**\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Я впевнений/а, що... | I'm sure that... |\n| Я переконаний/а, що... | I'm convinced that... |\n| Без сумніву, ... | Without a doubt, ... |\n| Безперечно, ... | Undoubtedly, ... |\n| Очевидно, що... | Obviously, ... |\n| Звісно, що... | Of course, ... |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Я впевнений**, що це правда. — I'm sure this is true.\n- **Без сумніву**, він найкращий кандидат. — Without a doubt, he's the best candidate.\n- **Очевидно**, що потрібні зміни. — Obviously, changes are needed.\n\n> 💡 **Did you know?**\n>\n> The word **впевнений** comes from \"певний\" (certain), which shares a root with \"віра\" (faith). To be впевнений literally means \"to have faith in something.\" Interestingly, the English \"sure\" is also related to Latin \"securus\" (without worry) — certainty as the absence of doubt!\n\n### Expressing uncertainty (Hedging)\n\nWhen you're less sure, use hedging expressions to soften your statements:\n\n**Lower certainty:**\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Можливо, ... | Perhaps, ... |\n| Напевно, ... | Probably, ... |\n| Мабуть, ... | Probably, maybe... |\n| Здається, ... | It seems... |\n| Ймовірно, ... | Probably, likely... |\n| Не впевнений/а, але... | Not sure, but... |\n| Важко сказати, але... | Hard to say, but... |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Можливо**, це правда. — Perhaps this is true.\n- **Мабуть**, він запізниться. — He'll probably be late.\n- **Не впевнений**, але здається, що так. — Not sure, but it seems so.\n\n### Justifying your opinion\n\nTo support your opinion with reasons, use these conjunctions:\n\n**Causal conjunctions:**\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| тому що | because |\n| оскільки | since, as |\n| через те, що | because of the fact that |\n| завдяки тому, що | thanks to the fact that |\n| адже | for, since, because |\n| бо | because (informal) |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Я так думаю, **тому що** це логічно. — I think so because it's logical.\n- Вона права, **оскільки** має досвід. — She's right since she has experience.\n- Це важливо, **адже** впливає на всіх. — This is important because it affects everyone.\n\n> 💡 **Did you know?**\n>\n> The conjunction **адже** is a favorite in journalism and formal speech. It comes from \"а\" + \"ж\" + \"є\" and carries a nuance of \"because it's just so\" — as if you're appealing to a commonly known fact. \"Адже всі знають, що...\" (\"After all, everyone knows that...\") is a rhetorical device that makes your opinion more persuasive.\n\n### Comparing viewpoints\n\nUse these expressions to present different perspectives:\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| З одного боку, ... з іншого боку, ... | On one hand, ... on the other hand, ... |\n| На відміну від... | Unlike... |\n| Порівняно з... | Compared to... |\n| Проте / Однак | However |\n| Незважаючи на те, що... | Despite the fact that... |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **З одного боку**, це дорого. **З іншого боку**, це якісно. — On one hand, it's expensive. On the other hand, it's quality.\n- **На відміну від** інших, він завжди приходить вчасно. — Unlike others, he always comes on time.\n- Це добре. **Проте** є недоліки. — This is good. However, there are drawbacks.\n\n### Strengthening your argument\n\nUse these expressions to emphasize key points:\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Головне, що... | The main thing is that... |\n| Найважливіше, що... | The most important thing is that... |\n| Перш за все, ... | First of all, ... |\n| До того ж, ... | Moreover, ... |\n| Крім того, ... | Besides, ... |\n| Особливо... | Especially... |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Головне**, що всі здорові. — The main thing is that everyone's healthy.\n- **Перш за все**, це безпечно. — First of all, it's safe.\n- **До того ж**, це ще й дешево. — Moreover, it's also cheap.\n\n### Summarizing\n\nUse these to wrap up your argument:\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Отже, ... | So, therefore, ... |\n| Загалом, ... | In general, ... |\n| Підсумовуючи, ... | Summarizing, ... |\n| Одним словом, ... | In a word, ... |\n| В цілому, ... | On the whole, ... |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Отже**, ми вирішили погодитися. — So, we decided to agree.\n- **Загалом**, я задоволений. — In general, I'm satisfied.\n- **Підсумовуючи**, це був успіх. — Summarizing, it was a success.\n\n---\n\n## Practice\n\n### Complete the expressions\n\nFill in the blanks with the appropriate Ukrainian expression:\n\n1. ___ думку, це правильно. (In my)\n   > [!answer] **На мою**\n2. Я ___, що він має рацію. (think/believe)\n   > [!answer] **вважаю/думаю**\n3. ___ боку, це добре. (On one)\n   > [!answer] **З одного**\n4. ___ сумніву, це найкращий варіант. (Without)\n   > [!answer] **Без**\n5. Він помилився, ___ не мав досвіду. (because)\n   > [!answer] **тому що/бо**\n6. ___, це хороша ідея. (In general)\n   > [!answer] **Загалом**\n\n### Rank by certainty\n\nRank these expressions from most certain to least certain:\n\n1. Я впевнений, що... — I'm sure that...\n   > [!answer] **1 (most certain)**\n2. Мені здається, що... — It seems to me that...\n   > [!answer] **4**\n3. Безперечно, ... — Undoubtedly\n   > [!answer] **2**\n4. Можливо, ... — Perhaps\n   > [!answer] **5 (least certain)**\n5. Напевно, ... — Probably\n   > [!answer] **3**\n\n### Answer the questions\n\nExpress your opinion using appropriate expressions:\n\n**Question:** Чи важливо вивчати іноземні мови? — Is it important to learn foreign languages?\n**Answer model:** На мою думку, це дуже важливо, тому що...\n\n**Question:** Яка найкраща пора року? — What's the best season?\n**Answer model:** Я вважаю, що..., оскільки...\n\n**Question:** Чи варто читати книги замість дивитися фільми? — Should one read books instead of watching movies?\n**Answer model:** З одного боку, ... з іншого боку, ...\n\n### Make it softer\n\nSoften these categorical statements using hedging:\n\n1. Він помилився. — He made a mistake.\n   > [!answer] **Мені здається, що він, можливо, помилився.** (It seems to me that he possibly made a mistake.)\n2. Це погана ідея. — It's a bad idea.\n   > [!answer] **На мою думку, це, мабуть, не найкраща ідея.** (In my opinion, this is probably not the best idea.)\n3. Вона права. — She's right.\n   > [!answer] **Здається, вона має рацію.** (It seems she's right.)\n\nMake them stronger:\n\n1. Можливо, це правильно. — Perhaps this is correct.\n   > [!answer] **Я впевнений, що це правильно.** (I'm sure this is correct.)\n2. Мабуть, він знає. — He probably knows.\n   > [!answer] **Безперечно, він знає.** (Undoubtedly, he knows.)\n\n---\n\n## Production\n\n### Discussion topics\n\nExpress your opinion on these topics:\n\n1. **Дистанційна робота** (Remote work)\n   - Is it good or bad? Why?\n   - What are the advantages and disadvantages?\n\n2. **Соціальні мережі** (Social media)\n   - More benefit or harm?\n   - What do you think about it?\n\n3. **Вивчення мов** (Language learning)\n   - Which language is most important?\n   - What's the best way to learn languages?\n\nUse: на мою думку, я вважаю, з одного боку, тому що, однак, загалом\n\n### Mini-debates\n\nPractice expressing opinions \"for\" and \"against\":\n\n**Topic:** Чи повинна освіта бути безкоштовною? — Should education be free?\n\n**For:** Я вважаю, що так, тому що...\n**Against:** На мій погляд, ні, оскільки...\n\n---"

In formal contexts (work, presentations), вважати sounds more professional.\n\n### Expressing certainty\n\nWhen you're confident about something, use these expressions:\n\n**High certainty:**\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Я впевнений/а, що... | I'm sure that... |\n| Я переконаний/а, що... | I'm convinced that... |\n| Без сумніву, ... | Without a doubt, ... |\n| Безперечно, ... | Undoubtedly, ... |\n| Очевидно, що... | Obviously, ... |\n| Звісно, що... | Of course, ... |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Я впевнений**, що це правда. — I'm sure this is true.\n- **Без сумніву**, він найкращий кандидат. — Without a doubt, he's the best candidate.\n- **Очевидно**, що потрібні зміни. — Obviously, changes are needed.\n\n> 💡 **Did you know?**\n>\n> The word **впевнений** comes from \"певний\" (certain), which shares a root with \"віра\" (faith). To be впевнений literally means \"to have faith in something.\" Interestingly, the English \"sure\" is also related to Latin \"securus\" (without worry) — certainty as the absence of doubt!\n\n### Expressing uncertainty (Hedging)\n\nWhen you're less sure, use hedging expressions to soften your statements:\n\n**Lower certainty:**\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Можливо, ... | Perhaps, ... |\n| Напевно, ... | Probably, ... |\n| Мабуть, ... | Probably, maybe... |\n| Здається, ... | It seems... |\n| Ймовірно, ... | Probably, likely... |\n| Не впевнений/а, але... | Not sure, but... |\n| Важко сказати, але... | Hard to say, but... |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Можливо**, це правда. — Perhaps this is true.\n- **Мабуть**, він запізниться. — He'll probably be late.\n- **Не впевнений**, але здається, що так. — Not sure, but it seems so.\n\n### Justifying your opinion\n\nTo support your opinion with reasons, use these conjunctions:\n\n**Causal conjunctions:**\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| тому що | because |\n| оскільки | since, as |\n| через те, що | because of the fact that |\n| завдяки тому, що | thanks to the fact that |\n| адже | for, since, because |\n| бо | because (informal) |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Я так думаю, **тому що** це логічно. — I think so because it's logical.\n- Вона права, **оскільки** має досвід. — She's right since she has experience.\n- Це важливо, **адже** впливає на всіх. — This is important because it affects everyone.\n\n> 💡 **Did you know?**\n>\n> The conjunction **адже** is a favorite in journalism and formal speech. It comes from \"а\" + \"ж\" + \"є\" and carries a nuance of \"because it's just so\" — as if you're appealing to a commonly known fact. \"Адже всі знають, що...\" (\"After all, everyone knows that...\") is a rhetorical device that makes your opinion more persuasive.\n\n### Comparing viewpoints\n\nUse these expressions to present different perspectives:\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| З одного боку, ... з іншого боку, ... | On one hand, ... on the other hand, ... |\n| На відміну від... | Unlike... |\n| Порівняно з... | Compared to... |\n| Проте / Однак | However |\n| Незважаючи на те, що... | Despite the fact that... |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **З одного боку**, це дорого. **З іншого боку**, це якісно. — On one hand, it's expensive. On the other hand, it's quality.\n- **На відміну від** інших, він завжди приходить вчасно. — Unlike others, he always comes on time.\n- Це добре. **Проте** є недоліки. — This is good. However, there are drawbacks.\n\n### Strengthening your argument\n\nUse these expressions to emphasize key points:\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Головне, що... | The main thing is that... |\n| Найважливіше, що... | The most important thing is that... |\n| Перш за все, ... | First of all, ... |\n| До того ж, ... | Moreover, ... |\n| Крім того, ... | Besides, ... |\n| Особливо... | Especially... |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Головне**, що всі здорові. — The main thing is that everyone's healthy.\n- **Перш за все**, це безпечно. — First of all, it's safe.\n- **До того ж**, це ще й дешево. — Moreover, it's also cheap.\n\n### Summarizing\n\nUse these to wrap up your argument:\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Отже, ... | So, therefore, ... |\n| Загалом, ... | In general, ... |\n| Підсумовуючи, ... | Summarizing, ... |\n| Одним словом, ... | In a word, ... |\n| В цілому, ... | On the whole, ... |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Отже**, ми вирішили погодитися. — So, we decided to agree.\n- **Загалом**, я задоволений. — In general, I'm satisfied.\n- **Підсумовуючи**, це був успіх. — Summarizing, it was a success.\n\n---\n\n## Practice\n\n### Complete the expressions\n\nFill in the blanks with the appropriate Ukrainian expression:\n\n1. ___ думку, це правильно.

Це погана ідея. — It's a bad idea.\n   > [!answer] **На мою думку, це, мабуть, не найкраща ідея.** (In my opinion, this is probably not the best idea.)\n3.
