Now it's time to discover another important use of the instrumental case — with the verbs **бути** (to be), **стати** (to become), and **працювати** (to work as)!\n\nWhen you want to say \"He is a doctor,\" \"She became a teacher,\" or \"I work as a programmer,\" Ukrainian uses the instrumental case. This is one of the most practical uses of the instrumental — talking about what people are and what they do!\n\n**Why is this important?** Talking about professions is a fundamental skill in any language. By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe your job, discuss career changes, and ask others about their work — all using proper Ukrainian grammar.\n\n> [!resources] 🔗 External Resources\n>\n> **YouTube:** [Bandura: The traditional Ukrainian instrument that's also a symbol of ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcrRlIR9_Ew) — Instrumental\n>\n> **Grammar Guide:** [Ukrainian Cases Overview](https://www.ukrainianlessons.com/intro-cases/) — All 7 cases explained\n>\n> **Interactive:** [Talk Ukrainian - Cases](https://talkukrainian.com/grammatical-cases/) — Practice exercises\n\n---"

        "content": "## Бути + Instrumental: Being Something\n\nIn Ukrainian, the present tense of \"to be\" is usually zero — we don't use a verb: Він лікар. (He is a doctor.) But in the **past** and **future** tenses, we use **бути** + **Instrumental**:\n\n| Tense | Pattern | Example |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n| Present | Він лікар. | He is a doctor. (no verb, nominative) |\n| Past | Він **був лікарем**. | He was a doctor. (бути + instrumental) |\n| Future | Він **буде лікарем**. | He will be a doctor. (бути + instrumental) |\n\n### Past Tense: був/була/було/були + Instrumental\n\nWhen talking about what someone WAS in the past, you use the past tense of \"бути\" followed by the instrumental case. The past tense agrees in gender with the subject: **він був** (masculine), **вона була** (feminine), **воно було** (neuter), **вони були** (plural).\n\nВін був студентом. (He was a student.)\nВона була вчителькою. (She was a teacher.)\nМи були друзями. (We were friends.)\n\nNotice how the profession changes to instrumental: студент → студентом, вчителька → вчителькою.\n\n### Future Tense: буде/будуть + Instrumental\n\nFor the future tense, use **буде** for singular subjects or **будуть** for plural subjects, followed by the instrumental case. This is how you express what someone WILL BE:\n\nВін буде лікарем. (He will be a doctor.)\nВона буде журналісткою. (She will be a journalist.)\nВони будуть інженерами. (They will be engineers.)\n\nThe pattern is consistent: бути in past or future + noun in instrumental case.\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> The present tense \"zero copula\" (no verb \"to be\") is a distinctive feature of Ukrainian and many Slavic languages. Russians use \"это\" for \"this is,\" but Ukrainians simply say \"Це.\" When Ukrainians speak English, they sometimes forget \"is\" because their brain doesn't expect a copula in present tense!\n\n## Стати + Instrumental: Becoming Something\n\nThe verb **стати** (to become) is one of the most important verbs in Ukrainian for talking about changes in profession or state. Unlike бути, which uses instrumental only in past and future, стати ALWAYS takes the instrumental case, in all tenses:\n\nВона стала вчителькою. (She became a teacher.)\nВін став лікарем. (He became a doctor.)\nМи стали друзями. (We became friends.)\n\nThis verb is perfective (completed action), so it's typically used in past and future. The imperfective counterpart is ставати (to be becoming).\n\n### Conjugation of стати (perfective, past + future)\n\n| Past | Future |\n|------|--------|\n| я став / стала | я стану |\n| ти став / стала | ти станеш |\n| він став | він стане |\n| вона стала | вона стане |\n| ми стали | ми станемо |\n| ви стали | ви станете |\n| вони стали | вони стануть |\n\nВона хоче стати лікаркою. (She wants to become a doctor.)\nВін мріє стати письменником. (He dreams of becoming a writer.)\nКоли ти станеш інженером? (When will you become an engineer?)\n\n> 📜 **History Bite**\n>\n> Many famous Ukrainians changed professions dramatically: Тарас Шевченко **був кріпаком** (was a serf), але **став великим поетом** (became a great poet). Леся Українка хотіла стати музикою, але стала геніальною письменницею. Their stories of becoming are told in the instrumental case!\n\n## Працювати + Instrumental: Working As\n\nThe verb **працювати** (to work) is used with the instrumental case to express what profession someone works as. This is different from English, where we use \"as\" + profession. In Ukrainian, no preposition is needed — just put the profession in instrumental:\n\nЯ працюю програмістом. (I work as a programmer.)\nВона працює журналісткою. (She works as a journalist.)\nВін працює водієм. (He works as a driver.)\n\nThe question word for \"as what\" is **ким?** — the instrumental form of **хто** (who).\n\nNote that you can also use **ким?** (as whom?) — this is the instrumental of **хто**:\n\n— Ким ти працюєш? (What do you work as?)\n— Я працюю вчителем. (I work as a teacher.)\n\n### Common Profession Verbs with Instrumental\n\nHere are the most common verbs that take the instrumental case when followed by a profession or role. Learning these patterns will help you talk about careers fluently:\n\n| Verb | Meaning | Example |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| бути (past/future) | to be | Він був студентом. |\n| стати | to become | Вона стала лікаркою. |\n| працювати | to work as | Я працюю інженером. |\n| служити | to serve as | Він служить солдатом. |\n| залишатися | to remain | Вона залишається директоркою. |\n\nNote that all these verbs follow the same pattern: verb + profession in instrumental case.\n\n> [!example] У кафе\n> — Ким працює твій брат?\n> — Він працює програмістом у великій компанії.\n> — А твоя сестра?\n> — Вона була студенткою, але зараз стала журналісткою.\n> — Круто! А ти?\n> — Я працюю вчителем. Мрію стати директором школи!\n\n---"

        "content": "## Ukrainian Professions: Gender Forms\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Ukrainian is that it has separate feminine forms for most professions. While English uses \"doctor\" for both men and women, Ukrainian distinguishes: **лікар** for a male doctor and **лікарка** for a female doctor.\n\nThis is not a modern invention — Ukrainian has always had productive suffixes like -ка, -иця, and -иня that form feminine nouns from masculine ones. Using the correct gender form is considered grammatically proper and respectful.\n\nThe main suffixes for feminine professions are:\n- **-ка**: лікар → лікарка, інженер → інженерка\n- **-иця**: письменник → письменниця\n\nHere is a table of common professions with their masculine and feminine forms:\n\n| Masculine | Feminine | English |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| лікар | лікарка | doctor |\n| вчитель | вчителька | teacher |\n| журналіст | журналістка | journalist |\n| інженер | інженерка | engineer |\n| програміст | програмістка | programmer |\n| юрист | юристка | lawyer |\n| актор | акторка | actor |\n| письменник | письменниця | writer |\n\nWhen talking about a woman's profession, use the feminine form in both nominative and instrumental:\n\nВона працює лікаркою. (She works as a doctor.)\nMaria стала письменницею. (Maria became a writer.)\n\n> 🔍 **Myth Buster**\n>\n> Some people claim feminine profession forms like \"лікарка\" or \"інженерка\" are \"new\" or \"artificial.\" This is false! Ukrainian has always had productive feminine suffixes. What IS new is their official recognition — the Ukrainian language was suppressed for centuries, so codification of natural forms was delayed. Using лікарка instead of лікар for a woman is grammatically correct and culturally authentic!\n\n## Famous Ukrainian Professionals\n\nUkraine has produced many outstanding professionals who changed the world. Here are some famous Ukrainians and their professions, demonstrating the instrumental case in action:\n\n| Name | Profession and Achievement |\n|------|------------|\n| Сергій Корольов | He **was an engineer** (був інженером) who created the Soviet space program. |\n| Леся Українка | She **became a writer** (стала письменницею) and poet. |\n| Соломія Крушельницька | She **was an opera singer** (була співачкою) of world renown. |\n| Ігор Сікорський | He **worked as an engineer** (працював інженером) and invented the helicopter. |\n\nNotice how each profession appears in the instrumental case after the verbs був, стала, була, and працював.\n\n> 🌍 **Real World**\n>\n> In modern Ukraine, IT professionals (програмісти) are one of the largest professional communities. Many Ukrainians say: \"Я працюю програмістом\" or \"Моя мрія — стати програмістом.\" The tech sector uses both masculine and feminine forms actively: програміст / програмістка.\n\n> [!tip] Common Mistakes\n> English speakers often try to use \"є\" (is) in present tense: \"Він є лікар.\" While this is understood, native Ukrainian simply says \"Він лікар.\" The verb \"to be\" is invisible in present tense — it appears only in past (був) and future (буде).\n\n> [!observe] Pattern Discovery\n> Notice that **стати** always takes instrumental, regardless of tense. Whether you say \"Він став лікарем\" (past), \"Він стане лікарем\" (future), or \"Він хоче стати лікарем\" (infinitive), the profession is always in instrumental!\n\n---"

        "content": "## Present vs. Past/Future\n\nThis is the key distinction you need to master: in present tense, Ukrainian doesn't use any verb for \"to be\" with professions. You simply state the subject and profession in nominative case. But in past and future tenses, you use бути followed by the profession in instrumental case.\n\nRemember: Present tense = no verb, Nominative. Past/Future = бути, Instrumental. This is a fundamental pattern in Ukrainian that differs from English where \"is\" appears in all tenses.\n\nStudy this table carefully to see the pattern across all three tenses:\n\n| Present (Nominative) | Past (Instrumental) | Future (Instrumental) |\n|---------|------|--------|\n| Він лікар. | Він **був лікарем**. | Він **буде лікарем**. |\n| Вона студентка. | Вона **була студенткою**. | Вона **буде студенткою**. |\n| Ми друзі. | Ми **були друзями**. | Ми **будемо друзями**. |\n\n## Form the Instrumental of Professions\n\nHere is a reference table showing how common professions change from nominative to instrumental case. Notice that masculine nouns typically add -ом or -ем, while feminine nouns add -ою:\n\n| Nominative | Instrumental | Gender |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| лікар | лікарем | masc |\n| вчитель | вчителем | masc |\n| інженер | інженером | masc |\n| програміст | програмістом | masc |\n| журналіст | журналістом | masc |\n| вчителька | вчителькою | fem |\n| лікарка | лікаркою | fem |\n\n## Mini-Dialogues\n\nPractice these conversations that demonstrate бути, стати, and працювати with instrumental case. English translations are provided to help you understand the meaning.\n\n**На вечірці (At a party):**\n— Ким ти працюєш? (What do you work as?)\n— Я працюю програмістом. А ти? (I work as a programmer. And you?)\n— Я вчителька. Працюю в школі. (I'm a teacher. I work at a school.)\n— Цікаво! А ким ти хочеш стати в майбутньому? (Interesting! What do you want to become in the future?)\n— Я хочу стати директоркою школи. (I want to become a school principal.)\n\n**У родині (In the family):**\n— Ким був твій дідусь? (What was your grandfather?)\n— Він був лікарем. (He was a doctor.)\n— А бабуся? (And grandmother?)\n— Вона була вчителькою музики. (She was a music teacher.)\n\n**На співбесіді (At a job interview):**\n— Ким ви працювали раніше? (What did you work as before?)\n— Я працював журналістом шість років. (I worked as a journalist for six years.)\n— А чому хочете змінити професію? (Why do you want to change professions?)\n— Я хочу стати програмістом. (I want to become a programmer.)\n\n---"

Here's a recap of the key patterns you mastered:\n\n**Key Pattern 1: Бути + Instrumental** for past and future tenses\n\nIn present tense, Ukrainian doesn't use a verb for \"to be\" with professions. But in past and future, you use бути followed by the instrumental case:\n- Він **був студентом**. (He was a student.)\n- Вона **буде лікаркою**.

(She became a teacher.)\n- Він **хоче стати програмістом**. (He wants to become a programmer.)\n\n**Key Pattern 3: Працювати + Instrumental** for working as\n\nNo preposition is needed — just verb + profession in instrumental:\n- Я **працюю інженером**. (I work as an engineer.)\n- Ким ти працюєш? (What do you work as?)\n\n**Gender Forms**: Remember that Ukrainian has separate masculine and feminine forms for most professions: лікар/лікарка, вчитель/вчителька, програміст/програмістка.

Now it's time to discover another important use of the instrumental case — with the verbs **бути** (to be), **стати** (to become), and **працювати** (to work as)!\n\nWhen you want to say \"He is a doctor,\" \"She became a teacher,\" or \"I work as a programmer,\" Ukrainian uses the instrumental case. This is one of the most practical uses of the instrumental — talking about what people are and what they do!\n\n**Why is this important?** Talking about professions is a fundamental skill in any language. By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe your job, discuss career changes, and ask others about their work — all using proper Ukrainian grammar.\n\n> [!resources] 🔗 External Resources\n>\n> **YouTube:** [Bandura: The traditional Ukrainian instrument that's also a symbol of ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcrRlIR9_Ew) — Instrumental\n>\n> **Grammar Guide:** [Ukrainian Cases Overview](https://www.ukrainianlessons.com/intro-cases/) — All 7 cases explained\n>\n> **Interactive:** [Talk Ukrainian - Cases](https://talkukrainian.com/grammatical-cases/) — Practice exercises\n\n---\n\n# Presentation\n\n## Бути + Instrumental: Being Something\n\nIn Ukrainian, the present tense of \"to be\" is usually zero — we don't use a verb: Він лікар. (He is a doctor.) But in the **past** and **future** tenses, we use **бути** + **Instrumental**:\n\n| Tense | Pattern | Example |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n| Present | Він лікар. | He is a doctor. (no verb, nominative) |\n| Past | Він **був лікарем**. | He was a doctor. (бути + instrumental) |\n| Future | Він **буде лікарем**. | He will be a doctor. (бути + instrumental) |\n\n### Past Tense: був/була/було/були + Instrumental\n\nWhen talking about what someone WAS in the past, you use the past tense of \"бути\" followed by the instrumental case. The past tense agrees in gender with the subject: **він був** (masculine), **вона була** (feminine), **воно було** (neuter), **вони були** (plural).\n\nВін був студентом. (He was a student.)\nВона була вчителькою. (She was a teacher.)\nМи були друзями. (We were friends.)\n\nNotice how the profession changes to instrumental: студент → студентом, вчителька → вчителькою.\n\n### Future Tense: буде/будуть + Instrumental\n\nFor the future tense, use **буде** for singular subjects or **будуть** for plural subjects, followed by the instrumental case. This is how you express what someone WILL BE:\n\nВін буде лікарем. (He will be a doctor.)\nВона буде журналісткою. (She will be a journalist.)\nВони будуть інженерами. (They will be engineers.)\n\nThe pattern is consistent: бути in past or future + noun in instrumental case.\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> The present tense \"zero copula\" (no verb \"to be\") is a distinctive feature of Ukrainian and many Slavic languages. Russians use \"это\" for \"this is,\" but Ukrainians simply say \"Це.\" When Ukrainians speak English, they sometimes forget \"is\" because their brain doesn't expect a copula in present tense!\n\n## Стати + Instrumental: Becoming Something\n\nThe verb **стати** (to become) is one of the most important verbs in Ukrainian for talking about changes in profession or state. Unlike бути, which uses instrumental only in past and future, стати ALWAYS takes the instrumental case, in all tenses:\n\nВона стала вчителькою. (She became a teacher.)\nВін став лікарем. (He became a doctor.)\nМи стали друзями. (We became friends.)\n\nThis verb is perfective (completed action), so it's typically used in past and future. The imperfective counterpart is ставати (to be becoming).\n\n### Conjugation of стати (perfective, past + future)\n\n| Past | Future |\n|------|--------|\n| я став / стала | я стану |\n| ти став / стала | ти станеш |\n| він став | він стане |\n| вона стала | вона стане |\n| ми стали | ми станемо |\n| ви стали | ви станете |\n| вони стали | вони стануть |\n\nВона хоче стати лікаркою. (She wants to become a doctor.)\nВін мріє стати письменником. (He dreams of becoming a writer.)\nКоли ти станеш інженером? (When will you become an engineer?)\n\n> 📜 **History Bite**\n>\n> Many famous Ukrainians changed professions dramatically: Тарас Шевченко **був кріпаком** (was a serf), але **став великим поетом** (became a great poet). Леся Українка хотіла стати музикою, але стала геніальною письменницею. Their stories of becoming are told in the instrumental case!\n\n## Працювати + Instrumental: Working As\n\nThe verb **працювати** (to work) is used with the instrumental case to express what profession someone works as. This is different from English, where we use \"as\" + profession. In Ukrainian, no preposition is needed — just put the profession in instrumental:\n\nЯ працюю програмістом. (I work as a programmer.)\nВона працює журналісткою. (She works as a journalist.)\nВін працює водієм. (He works as a driver.)\n\nThe question word for \"as what\" is **ким?** — the instrumental form of **хто** (who).\n\nNote that you can also use **ким?** (as whom?) — this is the instrumental of **хто**:\n\n— Ким ти працюєш? (What do you work as?)\n— Я працюю вчителем. (I work as a teacher.)\n\n### Common Profession Verbs with Instrumental\n\nHere are the most common verbs that take the instrumental case when followed by a profession or role. Learning these patterns will help you talk about careers fluently:\n\n| Verb | Meaning | Example |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| бути (past/future) | to be | Він був студентом. |\n| стати | to become | Вона стала лікаркою. |\n| працювати | to work as | Я працюю інженером. |\n| служити | to serve as | Він служить солдатом. |\n| залишатися | to remain | Вона залишається директоркою. |\n\nNote that all these verbs follow the same pattern: verb + profession in instrumental case.\n\n> [!example] У кафе\n> — Ким працює твій брат?\n> — Він працює програмістом у великій компанії.\n> — А твоя сестра?\n> — Вона була студенткою, але зараз стала журналісткою.\n> — Круто! А ти?\n> — Я працюю вчителем. Мрію стати директором школи!\n\n---\n\n# Cultural Insight\n\n## Ukrainian Professions: Gender Forms\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Ukrainian is that it has separate feminine forms for most professions. While English uses \"doctor\" for both men and women, Ukrainian distinguishes: **лікар** for a male doctor and **лікарка** for a female doctor.\n\nThis is not a modern invention — Ukrainian has always had productive suffixes like -ка, -иця, and -иня that form feminine nouns from masculine ones. Using the correct gender form is considered grammatically proper and respectful.\n\nThe main suffixes for feminine professions are:\n- **-ка**: лікар → лікарка, інженер → інженерка\n- **-иця**: письменник → письменниця\n\nHere is a table of common professions with their masculine and feminine forms:\n\n| Masculine | Feminine | English |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| лікар | лікарка | doctor |\n| вчитель | вчителька | teacher |\n| журналіст | журналістка | journalist |\n| інженер | інженерка | engineer |\n| програміст | програмістка | programmer |\n| юрист | юристка | lawyer |\n| актор | акторка | actor |\n| письменник | письменниця | writer |\n\nWhen talking about a woman's profession, use the feminine form in both nominative and instrumental:\n\nВона працює лікаркою. (She works as a doctor.)\nMaria стала письменницею. (Maria became a writer.)\n\n> 🔍 **Myth Buster**\n>\n> Some people claim feminine profession forms like \"лікарка\" or \"інженерка\" are \"new\" or \"artificial.\" This is false! Ukrainian has always had productive feminine suffixes. What IS new is their official recognition — the Ukrainian language was suppressed for centuries, so codification of natural forms was delayed. Using лікарка instead of лікар for a woman is grammatically correct and culturally authentic!\n\n## Famous Ukrainian Professionals\n\nUkraine has produced many outstanding professionals who changed the world. Here are some famous Ukrainians and their professions, demonstrating the instrumental case in action:\n\n| Name | Profession and Achievement |\n|------|------------|\n| Сергій Корольов | He **was an engineer** (був інженером) who created the Soviet space program. |\n| Леся Українка | She **became a writer** (стала письменницею) and poet. |\n| Соломія Крушельницька | She **was an opera singer** (була співачкою) of world renown. |\n| Ігор Сікорський | He **worked as an engineer** (працював інженером) and invented the helicopter. |\n\nNotice how each profession appears in the instrumental case after the verbs був, стала, була, and працював.\n\n> 🌍 **Real World**\n>\n> In modern Ukraine, IT professionals (програмісти) are one of the largest professional communities. Many Ukrainians say: \"Я працюю програмістом\" or \"Моя мрія — стати програмістом.\" The tech sector uses both masculine and feminine forms actively: програміст / програмістка.\n\n> [!tip] Common Mistakes\n> English speakers often try to use \"є\" (is) in present tense: \"Він є лікар.\" While this is understood, native Ukrainian simply says \"Він лікар.\" The verb \"to be\" is invisible in present tense — it appears only in past (був) and future (буде).\n\n> [!observe] Pattern Discovery\n> Notice that **стати** always takes instrumental, regardless of tense. Whether you say \"Він став лікарем\" (past), \"Він стане лікарем\" (future), or \"Він хоче стати лікарем\" (infinitive), the profession is always in instrumental!\n\n---\n\n# Practice\n\n## Present vs. Past/Future\n\nThis is the key distinction you need to master: in present tense, Ukrainian doesn't use any verb for \"to be\" with professions. You simply state the subject and profession in nominative case. But in past and future tenses, you use бути followed by the profession in instrumental case.\n\nRemember: Present tense = no verb, Nominative. Past/Future = бути, Instrumental. This is a fundamental pattern in Ukrainian that differs from English where \"is\" appears in all tenses.\n\nStudy this table carefully to see the pattern across all three tenses:\n\n| Present (Nominative) | Past (Instrumental) | Future (Instrumental) |\n|---------|------|--------|\n| Він лікар. | Він **був лікарем**. | Він **буде лікарем**. |\n| Вона студентка. | Вона **була студенткою**. | Вона **буде студенткою**. |\n| Ми друзі. | Ми **були друзями**. | Ми **будемо друзями**. |\n\n## Form the Instrumental of Professions\n\nHere is a reference table showing how common professions change from nominative to instrumental case. Notice that masculine nouns typically add -ом or -ем, while feminine nouns add -ою:\n\n| Nominative | Instrumental | Gender |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| лікар | лікарем | masc |\n| вчитель | вчителем | masc |\n| інженер | інженером | masc |\n| програміст | програмістом | masc |\n| журналіст | журналістом | masc |\n| вчителька | вчителькою | fem |\n| лікарка | лікаркою | fem |\n\n## Mini-Dialogues\n\nPractice these conversations that demonstrate бути, стати, and працювати with instrumental case. English translations are provided to help you understand the meaning.\n\n**На вечірці (At a party):**\n— Ким ти працюєш? (What do you work as?)\n— Я працюю програмістом. А ти?

Pay attention to how the bolded phrases follow the pattern: verb + profession in instrumental.\n\n> Моя родина цікава. Мій тато **працює інженером** на заводі. Раніше він **був студентом** політехнічного інституту. Моя мама **стала лікаркою** після університету. Вона **працює лікаркою** вже двадцять років.\n>\n> Мій старший брат **мріяв стати музикантом**, але **став програмістом**. Він каже, що це теж творча професія! Моя сестра **була журналісткою**, але зараз вона **стала письменницею**. Вона написала три книги.\n>\n> А я? Я ще студент. Я **хочу стати вчителем** української мови. Мої друзі кажуть, що я **буду хорошим вчителем**, бо я люблю пояснювати.\n\n**Comprehension Questions:** Answer these questions about the reading above. Notice that the answers also use instrumental case.\n\n1. Ким працює тато? — Він працює інженером.\n2. Ким стала мама? — Вона стала лікаркою.\n3. Ким мріяв стати брат? — Він мріяв стати музикантом.\n4. Ким була сестра? — Вона була журналісткою.\n5. Ким хоче стати оповідач? — Він хоче стати вчителем.\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nIn this module, you learned how to talk about professions using three key verbs that take the instrumental case: бути (to be), стати (to become), and працювати (to work as). Here's a recap of the key patterns you mastered:\n\n**Key Pattern 1: Бути + Instrumental** for past and future tenses\n\nIn present tense, Ukrainian doesn't use a verb for \"to be\" with professions. But in past and future, you use бути followed by the instrumental case:\n- Він **був студентом**. (He was a student.)\n- Вона **буде лікаркою**. (She will be a doctor.)\n- Present tense: no бути, use nominative (Він студент.)\n\n**Key Pattern 2: Стати + Instrumental** for becoming\n\nThe verb стати always takes instrumental, regardless of tense:\n- Вона **стала вчителькою**. (She became a teacher.)\n- Він **хоче стати програмістом**. (He wants to become a programmer.)\n\n**Key Pattern 3: Працювати + Instrumental** for working as\n\nNo preposition is needed — just verb + profession in instrumental:\n- Я **працюю інженером**. (I work as an engineer.)\n- Ким ти працюєш?
