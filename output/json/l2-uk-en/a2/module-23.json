You'll learn to compare products, ask for recommendations, and negotiate — all essential skills for real-world situations.\n\n**What you'll learn:**\n- Shopping comparison vocabulary\n- How to ask for advice and recommendations\n- Negotiation phrases\n- Making purchase decisions\n\n---\n\n## Presentation\n\n## Comparing Products\n\nWhen shopping, you'll constantly compare items. Here are key phrases:\n\n### Basic Comparisons\n\n- Цей **кращий**, але **дорожчий**. (This one is better, but more expensive.)\n- Той **дешевший** за цей. (That one is cheaper than this one.)\n- Який **найдешевший**? (Which is the cheapest?)\n- Мені **більше подобається** червоний. (I like the red one more.)\n\nWhen using these phrases, remember that adjectives like **кращий** (better) and **дорожчий** (more expensive) must agree in gender and number with the noun you are describing. If you are comparing two feminine items, you would use **краща** and **дорожча**. This grammatical agreement ensures that your sentences sound natural to native speakers.\n\n### Asking About Options\n\n- Що ви **порекомендуєте**? (What do you recommend?)\n- Є щось **краще**? (Is there something better?)\n- Є щось **дешевше**? (Is there something cheaper?)\n- Яка **різниця** між ними? (What's the difference between them?)\n\nAsking for a recommendation (**рекомендація**) is a smart strategy because it shifts the responsibility of choosing onto the expert (the seller). They will often point you toward the most popular or highest quality items currently in stock.\n\n> 💡 **Shopping Tip**\n>\n> Ukrainians appreciate when you ask for advice! \"Що ви порекомендуєте?\" is a great way to start a conversation with a shop assistant.\n\n## Negotiation Phrases\n\nIn some contexts (markets, small shops), negotiation is possible:\n\n### Asking for Discounts\n\n- Чи можна **дешевше**? (Can it be cheaper?)\n- Чи є **знижка**? (Is there a discount?)\n- Якщо візьму два, буде **дешевше**? (If I take two, will it be cheaper?)\n\n### Expressing Hesitation\n\n- Це **занадто** дорого. (This is too expensive.)\n- Я **подумаю**. (I'll think about it.)\n- Можливо, **повернуся**. (Maybe I'll come back.)\n\nIn Ukrainian culture, saying \"I'll think about it\" (**Я подумаю**) is a very common and polite way to leave a negotiation without making a purchase. It allows both parties to save face. If you are at a market and the price is truly too high, don't be afraid to use the word **занадто** (too/excessively) to express your hesitation clearly.\n\n> 📜 **Cultural Note**\n>\n> Negotiation is common at markets (ринок, базар) but unusual in regular stores and supermarkets. Always be polite when asking for discounts!\n\n## Making Decisions\n\n### Positive Decision\n\n- Я **візьму** цей. (I'll take this one.)\n- **Беру**! (I'll take it!)\n- Це мені **підходить**. (This suits me.)\n\n### Negative Decision\n\n- Дякую, **не потрібно**. (Thank you, not needed.)\n- Я **ще подумаю**. (I'll still think about it.)\n- Мені не **підходить**. (It doesn't suit me.)\n\nThe verb **підходити** (to suit/to fit) is very versatile in shopping. You can use it to talk about the price, the style, or even the physical fit of a piece of clothing. If something doesn't work for you, simply adding **не** (not) before the verb makes your refusal clear but remaining respectful to the seller.\n\n> [!tip] Polite Refusal\n> \"Дякую, я подумаю\" (Thank you, I'll think about it) is a polite way to decline without directly saying \"no.\"\n\n---\n\n## Cultural Insight\n\n## Shopping in Ukraine\n\nUkrainian shopping culture varies by location:\n\n**Supermarkets (супермаркет):**\n- Fixed prices, no negotiation\n- Self-service\n- Common in cities\n\n**Markets (ринок, базар):**\n- Fresh produce, clothes, goods\n- Negotiation possible\n- Cash preferred\n\n**Small shops (магазин, крамниця):**\n- Personal service\n- May have loyalty discounts\n- Good for local products\n\n## Shopping Strategies\n\n### 1. The Art of Polite Negotiation\n\nNegotiation (**торг**) is an art form in Ukrainian markets. It's not just about saving money; it's social interaction. In Ukraine, the process of bargaining is seen as a sign of mutual respect and interest in the product. It's perfectly normal to spend several minutes discussing the merits of a specific item before agreeing on a final price.\n- **Start soft:** \"Чи це остаточна ціна?\" (Is this the final price?)\n- **Point out flaws (gently):** \"Але тут маленька пляма...\" (But there is a small spot here...)\n- **Walk away (theatre):** \"Добре, я ще пройдуся...\" (Okay, I'll walk around a bit more...)\n\n### 2. Genitive Plural: Weighing Your Options\n\nWhen buying food, you often count or weigh things. This triggers the **Genitive Case** (often Plural).\n- **1 кілограм** (Nominative)\n- **2, 3, 4 кілограми** (Nominative Plural)\n- **5+ кілограмів** (Genitive Plural)\n\n> [!note] Grammar Check\n> Technically, \"кілограм\" has a zero ending in Genitive Plural in some dialects (5 кілограм), but standard literary Ukrainian prefers **кілограмів**.\n> - 200 **грамів** (grams)\n> - 5 **літрів** (liters)\n> - 10 **гривень** (hryvnias)\n\n### 3. Payment Vocabulary\n\n- **Готівка** (Cash) — King of the market.\n- **Карта** (Card) — Standard in shops.\n- **Решта** (Change) — \"У вас є решта з 500?\" (Do you have change from 500?)\n- **Чек** (Receipt) — \"Ваш чек, будь ласка.\" (Your receipt, please.)\n\nUnderstanding these payment terms is crucial because while city supermarkets almost always accept contact-less payments, many older bazar sellers still rely exclusively on physical cash transactions.\n\n---\n\n## Cultural Insight\n\n## The Soul of the \"Bazar\"\n\nThe Ukrainian **базар** (market) is more than a store; it's a community hub.\n- **Postiynyy Kliyent (Regular Customer):** The goal is to become a \"постійний клієнт\". Once a seller knows you, they will pick the best tomatoes for you, hide the freshest meat under the counter for you, and give you discounts without asking.\n- **Taste it!** Sellers will often offer: \"Спробуйте!\" (Taste it!). Refusing can sometimes be seen as rude if you are genuinely interested.\n- **Morning Glory:** The best produce is sold by 8-9 AM. If you arrive at noon, you get leftovers.\n\n> 🧠 **Myth: \"No Price Tags means Tourist Trap\"**\n>\n> In many Western countries, no price tag is a red flag. In a Ukrainian bazar, it just means the price fluctuates based on supply, time of day, and your negotiation skills! Always ask \"По чому?\" (How much? - colloquial) or \"Скільки коштує?\". This transparency in verbal price checks is an expected part of the interaction.\n\n> 🎭 **Roleplay Idea**\n>\n> Imagine you have 500 hryvnias. You need to buy vegetables for Borscht (potatoes, beets, carrots, cabbage, onion) and meat. Write down a shopping list and \"negotiate\" with a partner to see if you can fit it all in your budget!\n\n## Shopping for Clothes vs. Food\n\n| Feature | Clothes Shop | Food Market |\n|---------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Service** | \"Can I help you?\" leads to fitting room. | \"Taste this!\" leads to buying. |\n| **Space** | Personal space respected. | Crowded, pushy, lively. |\n| **Payment** | Card/Phone (NFC). | Cash (mostly), card-to-card transfer. |\n\n> [!tip] \"Paket\"\n> \"Пакет потрібен?\" (Do you need a bag?) is the most common phrase you will hear at any checkout. Ukrainians often carry their own reusable eco-bags.\n\n---\n\n## Practice\n\n## Practice Dialogues\n\n**Comparing phones:**\n- Цей телефон кращий, але дорожчий.\n- Є щось дешевше?\n- Так, ось цей. Він дешевший, але екран менший.\n- Яка різниця в ціні?\n- Два тисячі гривень.\n\n**At the market:**\n- Скільки коштують яблука?\n- Тридцять гривень за кілограм.\n- Занадто дорого. Чи можна дешевше?\n- Добре, двадцять п'ять.\n- Беру два кілограми!\n- Яка **ціна**? (What is the price?)\n- Це **дорогий** продукт. (This is an expensive product.)\n- Я хочу **шукати** **дешевий** товар. (I want to search for a cheap item.)\n- Де **знижка**? (Where is the discount?)\n\n**Dialogue: Buying Shoes**\n- **Клієнт:** Добрий день! Я шукаю зручні туфлі.\n- **Продавець:** Який у вас розмір?\n- **Клієнт:** Тридцять восьмий.\n- **Продавець:** Ось ці дуже хороші. Це натуральна шкіра.\n- **Клієнт:** Вони гарні, але трохи дорогі. Чи є знижка?\n- **Продавець:** Так, на цю модель мінус 10%.\n- **Клієнт:** Чудово! Можна поміряти?\n- **Продавець:** Звичайно, приміряйте. Дзеркало там.\n- **Клієнт:** Вони мені підходять. Беру!\n\n> [!tip] Sizes\n> Ukraine uses European shoe sizes (36, 37, 38...). Clothing sizes are also different from US/UK (S/M/L are common, but numbers like 44, 46, 48 are standard).\n\n##"
