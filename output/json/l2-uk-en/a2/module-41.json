Now meet **aspect** - a uniquely Slavic feature that English doesn't have!\n\n**The big idea:**\n- **Imperfective** = process, ongoing, repeated (like video)\n- **Perfective** = completed, single, result (like photo)\n\nCompare:\n- Я **читав** книгу. (I was reading a book - process, imperfective)\n- Я **прочитав** книгу. (I read/finished the book - completed, perfective)\n\nBoth are past tense, but different aspects!\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> English lost verbal aspect centuries ago, but Slavic languages kept it. This is why Ukrainian has \"verb pairs\" - two verbs for every action! It might seem complex, but it allows incredible precision in describing actions."
