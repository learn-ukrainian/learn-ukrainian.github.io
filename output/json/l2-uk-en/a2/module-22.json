This module teaches you to express hypothetical situations — things that could happen, might happen, or aren't real.\n\n**What you'll learn:**\n- Real conditions with якщо — if\n- Unreal conditions with якби (if... would)\n- The conditional particle б/би\n- Common hypothetical expressions\n\n---\n\n## Presentation\n\n## Real vs. Unreal Conditions\n\nUkrainian distinguishes between conditions that are possible (real) and conditions that are imaginary (unreal):\n\n### Real Conditions: якщо + future\n\nFor things that might actually happen:\n\n- **Якщо** матиму час, прочитаю книгу.\n  (If I have time, I will read the book.)\n- Якщо буде сонячно, підемо на прогулянку.\n  (If it's sunny, we'll go for a walk.)\n\n**Formation:** якщо + future tense + future tense result.\nThis structure is used for situations that are realistically possible or planned. For example, talking about the weather or your schedule for tomorrow.\n\n### Unreal Conditions: якби + past + б/би\n\nFor things that are not (or probably won't be) real:\n\n- **Якби** я мав час, я **б** прочитав книгу.\n  (If I had time, I would read the book.)\n- Якби я був багатим, я б купив будинок.\n  (If I were rich, I would buy a house.)\n\n**Formation:** якби + past tense + б/би + past tense result.\nThis structure describes imaginary or counterfactual scenarios. Use it when dreaming about the impossible or discussing \"what if\" situations that aren't true right now.\n\n> 💡 **Key Difference**\n>\n> **Якщо** = maybe true, could happen (real condition)\n> **Якби** = not true, hypothetical (unreal condition)\n\n## The Conditional Particle б/би\n\nThe particle **б/би** is essential for unreal conditions. It attaches to the verb or comes after the subject:\n\n| Position | Example | English |\n|----------|---------|---------|\n| After verb | Я читав би | I would read |\n| After pronoun | Я б читав | I would read |\n| After noun | Мама б сказала | Mom would say |\n\n**Both positions are correct!** \"Я б читав\" and \"Я читав би\" mean the same thing.\n\n### Common Patterns\n\n| Pattern | Example | English |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| Якби я був... | Якби я був богатим... | If I were rich... |\n| Якби я знав... | Якби я знав... | If I knew... |\n| Я б хотів... | Я б хотів побачити... | I would like to see... |\n| Вона б сказала... | Вона б сказала правду. | She would tell the truth. |\n\n> 📜 **Grammar Note**\n>\n> The conditional uses **past tense forms** for both the condition and the result, but the meaning is present or future hypothetical!\n\n## Common Conditional Expressions\n\n### Wishes and Desires\n\n- Я б хотів/хотіла... (I would like...)\n- Мені б хотілося... (I would want... — softer)\n- Було б добре... (It would be good...)\n- Це було б чудово! (That would be wonderful!)\n- Я б **обов'язково** пішов. (I would definitely go.)\n\n### Polite Requests\n\nUsing conditional makes requests more polite:\n- Чи могли б ви допомогти? (Could you help?)\n- Ви не могли б сказати...? (Could you tell...?)\n\n### Hypothetical Situations\n\n- Якби я був на твоєму місці... (If I were in your place...)\n- Якби я міг вибирати... (If I could choose...)\n\n> [!tip] Politeness Tip\n> Using \"б\" makes any request softer and more polite. \"Чи могли б ви...?\" is more polite than \"Чи можете ви...?\"\n\n> 💡 **Grammar: The Particle \"би\"**\n>\n> The particle **би** (or **б** after vowels) is the magic word that turns reality into fantasy. It signals \"would\".\n> - After consonant: **би** (Він мав **би**)\n> - After vowel: **б** (Я мала **б**)\n>\n> **Placement:** It usually comes right after the verb, but can move for emphasis. The choice between \"б\" and \"би\" is entirely based on the preceding sound. If the previous word ends in a vowel, use \"б\" (e.g., Вона б). If it ends in a consonant, use \"би\" (e.g., Він би). This makes the language flow more smoothly when spoken.\n> - Я **хотів би** це зробити. (Neutral)\n> - Я **б хотів** це зробити. (Emphasis on \"would\")\n\n## Polite Requests\n\nUsing the conditional mood is the standard for politeness in Ukrainian, just like \"Could you?\" in English.\n\nStructure: **Чи могли б ви + infinitive?**\nLiterally: \"Whether could would you...?\"\nThis is perhaps the most useful phrase for a traveler in Ukraine. It transforms a direct command into a soft, respectful inquiry. Using the past tense form \"могли\" combined with the particle \"б\" creates a polite hypothetical space, exactly like the English \"Could you possibly...\"\n\n- Чи могли б ви показати дорогу? (Could you show the way?)\n- Чи могли б ви зачекати хвилину? (Could you wait a minute?)\n- Чи могли б ви повторити? (Could you repeat?)\n- Чи могли б ви дати мені води? (Could you give me some water?)\n- Чи могли б ви зателефонувати пізніше? (Could you call later?)\n- Чи хотіли б ви кави? (Would you like coffee?)\n\n## Real vs. Unreal Conditions\n\n**Real Condition (Якщо + Future):**\n- Якщо я матиму час, я допоможу.\n- (If I have time [reality], I will help.)\n\n**Unreal Condition (Якби + Past + би):**\n- Якби я мав час, я **б** допоміг.\n- (If I had time [unreal], I **would** help.)\n\n> [!observe]\n> Notice the difference:\n> \"Якщо\" (If) → Plan\n> \"Якби\" (If only) → Dream\n\n---\n\n## Cultural Insight\n\n## Superstitions about the Future\n\nUkrainians can be superstitious about stating plans too definitely, fearing to \"jinx\" them (**наврочити**).\n- Instead of saying \"I will definitely do X\", they might add \"**Дасть Бог**\" (God willing) or \"**Подивимось**\" (We'll see).\n- Using the conditional (\"Якби...\") is a safe space because it's hypothetical!\n\n**Proverb:**\n\"Якби знав, де впаду, то соломки б підстелив.\"\n(If I knew where I'd fall, I would have spread some straw.)\nMeaning: You can't foresee everything, so hindsight is 20/20.\n\n## Dialogue: Winning the Lottery!\n\n**Олег:** Уяви, **якби** ти виграла мільйон доларів. Що **б** ти зробила?\n**Марія:** Ого! Це цікаве питання. Думаю, я **б купила** великий будинок біля моря.\n**Олег:** Тільки будинок?\n**Марія:** Ні, ще я **б подорожувала** цілий рік. Я **б відвідала** Японію та Австралію. А ти?\n**Олег:** А я **б відкрив** свій ресторан української кухні в Нью-Йорку.\n**Марія:** Це чудова мрія! Але **якщо** ми не купимо лотерейний білет, ми нічого не виграємо.\n**Олег:** Ти права. Це **реальність**.\n\n> 🧠 **Language Myth: \"Future in the Past\"**\n>\n> Unlike English \"I said I *would* go\", Ukrainian uses Future tense in reported speech: \"Я сказав, що *піду*\" (I said that I *will* go). You generally DON'T use the conditional **би** for reported future, only for hypotheticals. This is a common point of confusion for English speakers, as \"would\" in English serves both purposes, but in Ukrainian, the conditional mood is strictly for imaginary or unreal scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## Practice\n\n## Practice Examples\n\n## Saying Sorry and Politeness\n\nThe conditional mood is also perfect for saying sorry and soft refusals.\n\n- **Я б хотів вибачитися.** (I would like to apologize.)\n- **Я б не хотів заважати.** (I would not want to disturb.)\n- **Це було б незручно.** (That would be inconvenient.)\n\n**Dialogue: Refusing an Invitation**\n- **Іван:** Чи хотіли б ви піти в кіно?\n- **Анна:** Я б дуже хотіла, але я зайнята. Якби я мала час, я б пішла.\n- **Іван:** Розумію. Можливо, наступного разу?\n- **Анна:** Так, це було б чудово.\n\n> 🗣️ **Expression Focus: \"На твоєму місці\"**\n>\n> To give advice, use \"**Якби я був на твоєму місці...**\" (If I were in your place...).\n> - **Якби я був на твоєму місці, я б купив це.** (If I were you, I'd buy it.)\n> - **Якби я була на твоєму місці, я б не йшла туди.** (If I were you, I wouldn't go there.)\n\n---\n\n## Practice\n\n## Practice Examples\n\n4. **That would be great!**\n   → Це було б чудово!\n\n5. **I would not do that.**\n   → Я б цього не робив.\n\n6. **If I were you, I would ask.**\n   → Якби я був на твоєму місці, я б запитав.\n\n##"
