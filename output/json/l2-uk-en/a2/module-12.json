This concept distinguishes Slavic languages from most other language families and is essential for natural-sounding Ukrainian speech.\n\n**Understanding Aspect:**\nVerbal aspect is about HOW you conceptualize an action, not WHEN it happened. The same event can be described with either aspect depending on what you want to emphasize. Consider the difference between \"I wrote a letter\" (completed, result-focused) and \"I was writing a letter for two hours\" (process-focused, duration-emphasized).\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Ukrainian verbs come in pairs: imperfective and perfective\n- **Imperfective** (недоконаний вид) = process, repetition, duration, ongoing states\n- **Perfective** (доконаний вид) = completion, result, single completed events, beginning or end of action\n- Most perfective verbs are formed by adding prefixes (про-, на-, з-, по-, ви-)\n- Some pairs use different roots entirely (говорити/сказати, брати/взяти) — these are called suppletive pairs\n\n**Common Aspect-Triggering Contexts:**\n- Questions about activities: \"Що ти робив?\" (imperfective — asking about process)\n- Questions about completion: \"Ти зробив?\" (perfective — asking about result)\n- Duration markers (три години, довго, весь день) → usually imperfective\n- Completion markers (вже, нарешті, раптом) → usually perfective\n\n**The Golden Rule:** Ask yourself — \"Do I care about the process or the result?\"\n- Process → Imperfective\n- Result → Perfective\n\n> 🌍 **Культурний контекст**\n>\n> Аспект — це не просто граматика, це спосіб мислення! Українці бачать дії як процеси або результати. Коли ви вибираєте аспект, ви думаєте як носій мови.\n>\n> *Translation: Aspect is not just grammar, it's a way of thinking! Ukrainians see actions as processes or results. When you choose aspect, you think like a native speaker.*\n\n> 💡 **Українське прислів'я**\n>\n> «Говорити — не робити.» (Говорити — недоконаний, робити — недоконаний: обидва показують процес, не результат!)\n>\n> *Translation: \"Talking is not doing.\" (Both verbs are imperfective — process, not result!)*\n\nТепер ви розумієте основи аспекту! Продовжуйте практикувати — це найважливіша граматична тема для природного мовлення українською. Пам'ятайте: кожен день ви **читаєте** (процес), і колись ви **прочитаєте** всю книгу (результат)! 📚\n\n## Need More Practice?\n\n---"

    "rawMarkdown": "## Warm-up\n\n**Ласкаво просимо!** Сьогодні ви дізнаєтесь про аспект — одну з найважливіших тем української граматики.\n\nWelcome to one of the most important concepts in Ukrainian grammar — verbal aspect! While English uses different verb forms to show whether an action is complete or ongoing (I read vs. I was reading), Ukrainian uses two separate verbs with different stems.\n\n**Чому аспект важливий?** Неправильний вибір аспекту одразу помітний для носіїв мови. Коли ви опануєте аспект, ваша українська стане набагато природнішою!\n\n**What you'll learn in this module:**\n- The difference between imperfective and perfective verbs\n- How to recognize aspect pairs\n- When to use each aspect\n- Common aspect pairs for essential verbs\n\n## Presentation\n\n## What is Verbal Aspect?\n\nUkrainian verbs come in pairs — one **imperfective** (недоконаний вид) and one **perfective** (доконаний вид). These aren't just different conjugations of the same verb; they're actually two different verbs with related but distinct meanings.\n\n**Imperfective verbs** (недоконаний вид) focus on:\n- Ongoing processes\n- Repeated or habitual actions\n- Duration without a clear endpoint\n\n**Perfective verbs** (доконаний вид) focus on:\n- Completed actions with a clear result\n- Single, one-time events\n- The beginning or end of an action\n\n> 💡 **Key Concept**\n>\n> Think of imperfective as the \"movie\" of an action (you see the process unfolding) and perfective as the \"photo\" of the action (you see only the completed result).\n\n## Aspect in Practice\n\nLet's see how aspect changes meaning with the pair **читати | прочитати** (to read):\n\n| Aspect | Example | Meaning |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| Imperfective | Я читав книгу. | I was reading a book. (process, maybe not finished) |\n| Perfective | Я прочитав книгу. | I read/finished the book. (completed) |\n| Imperfective | Я читаю щодня. | I read every day. (habitual) |\n| Perfective | Я прочитаю завтра. | I will read/finish it tomorrow. (will complete) |\n\n> 📜 **Why This Exists**\n>\n> Many Slavic languages have aspect, but Ukrainian's system is particularly rich. The distinction has existed for over 1000 years and evolved from Proto-Slavic. It's not an unusual feature — it's a fundamental part of how Slavic speakers conceptualize actions!\n\n## Basic Aspect Pairs\n\nMost aspect pairs are formed by adding a prefix to the imperfective verb to create the perfective. Here are the most common patterns:\n\n### Prefixation (Most Common)\n\n| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |\n|--------------|------------|---------|\n| читати | **про**читати | to read |\n| писати | **на**писати | to write |\n| робити | **з**робити | to do/make |\n| бачити | **по**бачити | to see |\n| чути | **по**чути | to hear |\n| вчити | **ви**вчити | to learn/study |\n\n### Suppletive Pairs (Different Roots)\n\nSome aspect pairs use completely different roots. You must memorize these:\n\n| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |\n|--------------|------------|---------|\n| говорити | сказати | to say/speak |\n| брати | взяти | to take |\n| класти | покласти | to put |\n\n> [!tip] Memorization Strategy\n> Start with the 10 most common pairs. Use them in sentences every day. Aspect becomes natural only through practice, not memorization of rules!\n\n## When to Use Each Aspect\n\n### Use IMPERFECTIVE when:\n\n1. **Process matters more than result:**\n   - Що ти робив учора? (What were you doing yesterday?)\n   - Я читав книгу. (I was reading a book.)\n\n2. **Action is repeated or habitual:**\n   - Я читаю щодня. (I read every day.)\n   - Вона завжди пише листи. (She always writes letters.)\n\n3. **Duration is emphasized:**\n   - Він писав три години. (He was writing for 3 hours.)\n\n### Use PERFECTIVE when:\n\n1. **Result or completion matters:**\n   - Я прочитав книгу. (I finished reading the book.)\n   - Він написав листа. (He wrote/finished the letter.)\n\n2. **Single, completed event:**\n   - Вона сказала \"так.\" (She said \"yes.\")\n   - Ми побачили море. (We saw the sea.)\n\n3. **Action will be completed:**\n   - Я прочитаю завтра. (I will finish reading tomorrow.)\n\n> 🔍 **Common Mistake**\n>\n> Don't translate directly from English! \"I read the book\" could be either aspect depending on context. Ask: \"Am I focusing on the process or the result?\"\n\n---\n\n## Cultural Insight\n\n## Aspect and Ukrainian Thinking\n\nUnderstanding aspect helps you understand how Ukrainian speakers conceptualize time and actions. When a Ukrainian says \"Я читав книгу,\" they're inviting you into the process — you can almost see them sitting with the book. When they say \"Я прочитав книгу,\" they're reporting a completed achievement.\n\n**Examples in context:**\n\n**Question:** Що ти робив учора? (What were you doing yesterday?)\n- Imperfective question = asking about process/activities\n- Answer: Я читав, писав, працював... (I was reading, writing, working...)\n\n**Question:** Ти прочитав книгу? (Did you finish reading the book?)\n- Perfective question = asking about completion/result\n- Answer: Так, прочитав. | Ні, ще читаю. (Yes, I finished. | No, I'm still reading.)\n\n> [!tip] Context Clue Words\n> Some words often appear with specific aspects:\n> **Imperfective:** завжди, часто, довго, кожен день\n> **Perfective:** вже, нарешті, раптом, вчора (single event)\n\n---\n\n## Practice\n\n## Practice Examples\n\nRead these sentences and identify whether they use imperfective or perfective:\n\n1. Я писав листа дві години. → **Imperfective** (duration)\n2. Я написав листа вчора. → **Perfective** (completed)\n3. Вона читає кожен день. → **Imperfective** (habitual)\n4. Він прочитав усю книгу. → **Perfective** (completed result)\n5. Ми завжди говоримо українською. → **Imperfective** (habitual)\n6. Вона сказала правду. → **Perfective** (single completed event)\n\n**Additional Practice:**\nNow try these more challenging examples. Think about WHY each aspect is used:\n\n7. Він довго вчився. → **Imperfective** (duration emphasized with \"довго\")\n8. Він вивчив німецьку мову. → **Perfective** (achieved mastery — result)\n9. Я часто бачив його в парку. → **Imperfective** (repeated action - \"часто\")\n10. Я раптом побачив знайомого. → **Perfective** (sudden single event - \"раптом\")\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\n## What You Learned\n\nIn this module, you learned about verbal aspect — one of the most important features of Ukrainian grammar.
