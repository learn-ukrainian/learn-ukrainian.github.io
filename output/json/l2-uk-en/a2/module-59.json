Instead, it often prefers active voice with impersonal subjects or reflexive verbs. But knowing passive is essential for understanding news, official documents, and formal texts!\n\n## presentation\n\n### Impersonal Constructions\n\n**Impersonal sentences** don't have a specific subject - they describe general situations:\n\n**Common patterns:**\n\n| Ukrainian | Meaning |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Треба... | It's necessary to... / One must... |\n| Можна... | It's possible to... / One may... |\n| Не можна... | It's forbidden to... / One mustn't... |\n| Потрібно... | It's needed to... |\n| Варто... | It's worth... |\n| Слід... | One should... |\n| Заборонено... | It's forbidden... |\n| Дозволено... | It's allowed... |\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Треба** працювати. - One must work. / It's necessary to work.\n- **Можна** запитати? - May I ask? / Is it possible to ask?\n- Тут **не можна** курити. - Smoking is not allowed here.\n- **Варто** спробувати. - It's worth trying.\n- **Заборонено** входити. - Entry is forbidden.\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Adding Subject**\n>\n> To specify WHO, use dative case:\n> - **Мені** треба працювати. - I need to work.\n> - **Тобі** можна йти. - You may go.\n> - **Нам** варто подумати. - We should think about it.\n\n### Reflexive as Passive\n\nUkrainian often uses **reflexive verbs (-ся)** where English uses passive:\n\n**Active → Reflexive (passive meaning):**\n- Будують будинок. → Будинок **будується**. - A house is being built.\n- Продають квитки. → Квитки **продаються**. - Tickets are sold.\n- Говорять, що... → **Говориться**, що... - It is said that...\n\n**Common reflexive passives:**\n| Reflexive | Meaning |\n|-----------|---------|\n| продається | is sold |\n| здається | is rented out |\n| вважається | is considered |\n| називається | is called |\n| готується | is being prepared |\n| пишеться | is written |\n\n**Examples:**\n- Ця книга **продається** в магазині. - This book is sold in the store.\n- Квартира **здається**. - Apartment for rent.\n- Це **вважається** поганим. - This is considered bad.\n- Як це **пишеться**? - How is this written?\n- Як це **називається**? - What is this called?\n\n> 🎭 **Culture Corner: Signs and Notices**\n>\n> You'll see reflexive passives everywhere in Ukraine:\n> - \"Продається\" - For sale\n> - \"Здається\" - For rent\n> - \"Відчинено/Зачинено\" - Open/Closed\n> - \"Вхід заборонено\" - Entry forbidden\n\n### -но/-то Participles (Passive Result)\n\nThese forms show the **result** of a completed action (who did it is unknown/unimportant):\n\n**Formation:** verb stem + -но (most) or -то (some verbs)\n\n| Infinitive | -но/-то form | Meaning |\n|------------|--------------|---------|\n| зробити | зроблено | done/made |\n| написати | написано | written |\n| сказати | сказано | said |\n| відкрити | відкрито | opened |\n| закрити | закрито | closed |\n| зайняти | зайнято | occupied |\n| продати | продано | sold |\n| прийняти | прийнято | accepted |\n\n**Usage:**\n- Роботу **зроблено**. - The work is done.\n- Лист **написано**. - The letter is written.\n- **Сказано** — **зроблено**. - Said — done.

Russian uses different constructions. These forms are ancient and very common in everyday speech and official language.\n\n### Passive with \"бути\" + Participle\n\nFor more formal passive, use **бути** + passive participle (-ний/-тий):\n\n**Formation:** бути + participle (agrees with subject)\n\n| Verb | Participle (m/f/n/pl) |\n|------|----------------------|\n| зробити | зроблений/зроблена/зроблене/зроблені |\n| написати | написаний/написана/написане/написані |\n| відкрити | відкритий/відкрита/відкрите/відкриті |\n| побудувати | побудований/побудована/побудоване/побудовані |\n\n**Examples:**\n- Лист **був написаний** вчора. - The letter was written yesterday.\n- Книга **буде опублікована** завтра. - The book will be published tomorrow.\n- Ці будинки **були побудовані** в 19 столітті. - These buildings were built in the 19th century.\n- Музей **зараз зачинений**. - The museum is currently closed.\n\n### Common Passive Expressions\n\n**In daily life:**\n- Вхід **заборонено**. - Entry forbidden.\n- Вихід **тут**. - Exit here.\n- **Зачинено** на ремонт. - Closed for repairs.\n- **Продано**! - Sold!\n- **Зайнято**. - Occupied/Busy.\n- **Вільно**. - Free/Available.\n\n**In news/formal:**\n- **Повідомляється**, що... - It is reported that...\n- **Очікується**, що... - It is expected that...\n- **Було прийнято** рішення. - A decision was made.\n- **Буде оголошено** завтра. - It will be announced tomorrow.\n\n### They Say / It Is Said\n\n**General statements without specific subject:**\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Кажуть, що... | They say that... |\n| Говорять, що... | They say that... |\n| Вважають, що... | It's believed that... |\n| Відомо, що... | It's known that... |\n| Вважається, що... | It's considered that... |\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Кажуть**, що завтра буде дощ. - They say it will rain tomorrow.\n- **Говорять**, він дуже розумний. - They say he's very smart.\n- **Відомо**, що це небезпечно. - It's known that this is dangerous.\n- **Вважається**, що це найкращий варіант. - It's considered the best option.\n\n## practice\n\n### Transform to Passive/Impersonal\n\n1.
