To travel to Kyiv?\nIn this module, we will learn how to explain \"why\" we do things using purpose clauses. The key word is **щоб** (in order to / so that). Mastering this structure allows you to express your motivations, goals, and even your wishes for other people.\n\n**In this lesson, we will cover:**\n- **Same Subject:** щоб + Infinitive (I came to help).\n- **Different Subjects:** щоб + Past Tense (I want you to come).\n- **Purpose vocabulary:** Купувати, заробляти, вчитися.\n\n> 💡 **The Goal-Oriented Language**\n> In Ukrainian, **щоб** is the bridge between an action and its goal. It is one of the most powerful connectors for moving beyond simple sentences and building complex, logical narratives.\n\n---\n\n## Presentation\n\n## 1. Same Subject: In order to...\n\nWhen the person doing the action and the person for whom the purpose is intended are the same, we use **щоб** followed by the **infinitive** form of the verb.\n\n- Я прийшов, **щоб допомогти**. (I came [in order] to help.)\n- Ми вчимося, **щоб знати** мову. (We study to know the language.)\n- Він працює, **щоб заробляти** гроші. (He works to earn money.)\n\n## 2. Different Subjects: So that someone else...\n\nThis is a unique feature of Ukrainian. If the subjects are different (I want YOU to do something), we use **щоб** followed by the **past tense** form of the verb. Even though the meaning might be in the future or present, the grammar requires the past form.\n\n- Я хочу, **щоб ти прийшов**. (I want you to come; Literal: I want so-that you came.)\n- Вона попросила, **щоб ми мовчали**. (She asked that we be silent.)\n- Батьки хочуть, **щоб діти були** щасливі. (Parents want children to be happy.)\n\n> [!important] Match the Gender!\n> Because we use the past tense form in different-subject clauses, the verb must agree in gender and number with the second subject.\n> *Я хочу, щоб вона **сказала** правду.* (I want her to tell the truth.)\n\nOften, the best way to understand **щоб** is to look at how it connects different parts of a sentence. In Ukrainian, we don't just say \"I want you to help,\" which uses a direct object and an infinitive. Instead, we create a secondary clause: \"I want, so-that you helped.\" This structure highlights the importance of the second person's agency and makes the request sound more polite and indirect.\n\nIn daily life, you will hear **щоб** everywhere. At the supermarket (**магазин**), people buy food to cook dinner. At the university (**університет**), students study to pass exams. In the office, managers set goals so that the team achieves success. Each of these situations requires the correct form of **щоб** to be grammatically precise.\n\n## 3. Purpose vs. Result\n\nBe careful not to confuse **щоб** (purpose) with **тому що** (reason) or **так що** (so/result).\n- Я пішов у магазин, **тому що** був голодний. (Reason)\n- Я пішов у магазин, **щоб** купити хліб. (Purpose)\n\n##"
