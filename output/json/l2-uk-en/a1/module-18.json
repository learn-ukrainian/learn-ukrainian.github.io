In Ukraine, you have many choices: the **супермаркет** (supermarket), a traditional **ринок** (market), or small **магазини** (stores) scattered throughout every neighborhood. Each place has its own character and culture.\n\nToday, you'll learn how to navigate Ukrainian stores and cafés with confidence. You'll order food, ask for prices, and even do some everyday shopping beyond the grocery aisle.\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> Ukrainians love their **ринки** (markets)! Fresh produce, homemade cheeses, and seasonal fruits are sold by vendors who've been selling at the same spot for decades. It's not just shopping—it's a social experience. You greet the vendors, they remember your preferences, and you bargain a little. Try saying \"Скільки коштує?\" (How much is it?) at Besarabsky Market in Kyiv!\n\n## Presentation\n\n### Grammar Review: Accusative and Genitive Together\n\nYou've already learned the **accusative case** (M11: direct objects) and the **genitive case** (M16: absence and possession).

(How much is the cheese?)\nСкільки коштує **хліб**? (How much is the bread?)\nСкільки коштує **кава**? (How much is the coffee?)\n\nNotice: After \"скільки коштує\" (how much is/does it cost?), the noun stays in **nominative** because the question is \"What costs how much?\"\n\n> 🌍 **Реальний світ: У супермаркеті (Real World: At the Supermarket)**\n>\n> Супермаркети в Україні працюють як у всьому світі.
