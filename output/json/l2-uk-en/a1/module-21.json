Learn how to say what happened yesterday, last week, or long ago.\n\n## Warm-up: What Did You Do Yesterday?\n\nThink about yesterday. What did you do? Maybe you worked, studied, or met a friend. Now you'll learn how to express all of this in Ukrainian!\n\nUkrainian past tense is remarkably straightforward compared to languages like English or French. There's only ONE past tense in Ukrainian (no distinction between \"I worked\" and \"I was working\"). Even better, the endings are logical and follow the same gender patterns you already know!\n\nThe past tense tells us WHO did something (by gender) and WHEN (by context). Unlike present tense, which shows person (я/ти/він), past tense shows GENDER instead. This is a beautiful feature of Slavic languages — even verbs respect gender!\n\nConsider this: In English, \"I read\" and \"he read\" look identical in the past. In Ukrainian, \"Я читав\" (male) vs \"Я читала\" (female) immediately tells the listener the speaker's gender. Elegant, isn't it?\n\nThis module introduces the L-participle — called so because past tense forms end in -в/-л-. By the end, you'll be able to tell stories about what you did, what others did, and when things happened.\n\n> 💡 **Thinking Trick:** Past tense = infinitive stem + gender endings. If you know the infinitive and the gender of the subject, you can form ANY past tense verb!\n\n## Presentation: Past Tense Formation\n\n### The L-Participle: How It Works\n\nUkrainian past tense uses the L-participle, formed from the infinitive:\n\n**Step 1:** Take the infinitive (e.g., читати - to read)\n**Step 2:** Remove -ти (чита-)\n**Step 3:** Add the gender ending:\n\n| Gender | Ending | Example (читати) |\n|--------|--------|------------------|\n| Masculine | -в | він читав |\n| Feminine | -ла | вона читала |\n| Neuter | -ло | воно читало |\n| Plural | -ли | вони читали |\n\n**Key insight:** Past tense agrees with SUBJECT GENDER, not person! That's why:\n- Я читав = I read (male speaker)\n- Я читала = I read (female speaker)\n\n### Common Verb Conjugations\n\n**-ати verbs (most common):**\n| Infinitive | Meaning | M | F | N | Pl |\n|------------|---------|---|---|---|----| \n| читати | to read | читав | читала | читало | читали |\n| працювати | to work | працював | працювала | працювало | працювали |\n| гуляти | to walk | гуляв | гуляла | гуляло | гуляли |\n| слухати | to listen | слухав | слухала | слухало | слухали |\n\n**-ити verbs:**\n| Infinitive | Meaning | M | F | N | Pl |\n|------------|---------|---|---|---|----| \n| говорити | to speak | говорив | говорила | говорило | говорили |\n| бачити | to see | бачив | бачила | бачило | бачили |\n| ходити | to go | ходив | ходила | ходило | ходили |\n| робити | to do | робив | робила | робило | робили |\n\n### Common Irregular Verbs\n\nSome verbs have slightly different stems:\n\n| Infinitive | Meaning | M | F | Pl |\n|------------|---------|---|---|---| \n| бути | to be | був | була | були |\n| їсти | to eat | їв | їла | їли |\n| піти | to go (perf.) | пішов | пішла | пішли |\n| прийти | to come | прийшов | прийшла | прийшли |\n| сказати | to say | сказав | сказала | сказали |\n| почати | to begin | почав | почала | почали |\n\n> 📜 **Pattern Summary:**\n> - **Regular -ати:** stem + в/ла/ло/ли (працювати → працював)\n> - **Regular -ити:** stem + в/ла/ло/ли (говорити → говорив)\n> - **Їсти:** їв, їла, їло, їли (stem changes)\n> - **Піти:** пішов, пішла, пішло, пішли (stem changes)\n\n### Time Expressions for the Past\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| вчора | yesterday |\n| позавчора | day before yesterday |\n| минулого тижня | last week |\n| минулого місяця | last month |\n| минулого року | last year |\n| давно | long ago |\n| недавно | recently |\n| раніше | earlier, before |\n| колись | once, sometime |\n| тоді | then, at that time |\n\n**Example sentences:**\n- Вчора я читала книгу. (Yesterday I read a book. - female)\n- Минулого тижня ми були в Києві. (Last week we were in Kyiv.)\n- Він колись жив у Львові. (He once lived in Lviv.)\n- Раніше вони говорили російською. (Before, they spoke Russian.)\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?** The L-participle is also used to form other tenses (conditional, compound future). Master it now, and you'll find advanced grammar much easier!\n\n## Cultural Insight: Storytelling in Ukraine 🇺🇦\n\nUkrainians love to tell stories! Whether recounting family history, sharing news, or joking with friends, narrative skills are highly valued. Learning past tense unlocks your ability to participate in this rich storytelling tradition.\n\nNotice how time expressions work in practice:\n\n- **Колись** (once, long ago) — for distant events, legends, personal history\n- **Раніше** (before, earlier) — for habits that changed, past states\n- **Недавно** (recently) — for recent news and updates\n\n**Common storytelling phrases:**\n- Одного разу... (Once upon a time... / One time...)\n- Це було... (It was... / This happened...)\n- Коли я був маленьким... (When I was little...)\n- Пам'ятаю, як... (I remember how...)\n\n> 📜 **History Bite:** Under Russian and Soviet rule, Ukrainians often told their true history in whispers — in private, at family gatherings. Stories of the Holodomor, of the Executed Renaissance, of resistance were passed down orally when books were banned. This tradition of oral history made storytelling a survival skill. Now, you carry on that tradition by learning to tell stories in Ukrainian!\n\n> 📜 **Myth Buster:** Russian propaganda claims Ukrainian is \"just peasant Russian.\" In reality, Ukrainian literary tradition is ancient and rich. The first book printed in the Ukrainian lands was in 1574 in Lviv — decades before many European nations had printing presses! Ukrainian oral poetry (думи) and kobzar tradition are UNESCO-recognized cultural heritage.\n\n## Reading Practice: Мій учорашній день 📖\n\n**Українською:**\n\nУчора був гарний день. Я прокинувся о сьомій годині. Спочатку я випив каву і поснідав. Потім я пішов на роботу. На роботі я працював до шостої години.\n\nУвечері я зустріла подругу. Ми пішли в кафе біля центру. Я замовила капучіно, а вона — латте. Ми розмовляли про життя і сміялися. Було дуже весело!\n\nО дев'ятій я повернулася додому. Я подивилася новини і почитала книжку. Потім я лягла спати. День був чудовий!\n\n**English Translation:**\n\nYesterday was a nice day. I woke up at seven o'clock. First, I drank coffee and had breakfast. Then I went to work. At work, I worked until six o'clock.\n\nIn the evening, I met a friend. We went to a café near the center. I ordered a cappuccino, and she ordered a latte. We talked about life and laughed. It was very fun!\n\nAt nine, I came back home. I watched the news and read a book. Then I went to sleep. The day was wonderful!\n\n**Grammar note:** Notice the gender switch (прокинувся/зустріла) — this shows different speakers or narrator perspective!\n\n## Conversation: Що ти робив учора? 🗣️\n\n**Оксана:** Привіт, Дмитре! Як справи?\n**Дмитро:** Привіт! Добре, дякую. Вчора був цікавий день.\n**Оксана:** О? Що ти робив?\n**Дмитро:** Зранку я працював. Потім обідав у новому ресторані.\n**Оксана:** Смачно було?\n**Дмитро:** Дуже! Я їв борщ і вареники. А ти що робила?\n**Оксана:** Я була в музеї. Бачила нову виставку.\n**Дмитро:** Цікаво! Треба теж сходити.\n**Оксана:** Так, рекомендую! До зустрічі!\n**Дмитро:** Бувай!\n\n**English Translation:**\n**Oksana:** Hi, Dmytro! How are you?\n**Dmytro:** Hi! Good, thanks. Yesterday was an interesting day.\n**Oksana:** Oh? What did you do?\n**Dmytro:** In the morning I worked. Then I had lunch in a new restaurant.\n**Oksana:** Was it tasty?\n**Dmytro:** Very! I ate borscht and varenyky. And what did you do?\n**Oksana:** I was in a museum. I saw a new exhibition.\n**Dmytro:** Interesting! I need to go too.\n**Oksana:** Yes, I recommend it! See you!\n**Dmytro:** Bye!\n\nЗверни увагу: робив/робила, їв/бачила — минулий час завжди показує рід!"
