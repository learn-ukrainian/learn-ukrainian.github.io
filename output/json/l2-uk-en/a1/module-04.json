        "content": "## warm-up\n\nIn English, you always need a verb. You say: \"I **am** a student.\" You cannot just say \"I student.\" It sounds like Tarzan.\nIn Ukrainian, you say exactly that: \"I student.\" (**Я студент**).\n\nIn English: \"This **is** a bank.\"\nIn Ukrainian: \"This bank.\" (**Це банк**).\n\nWelcome to the **Zero Copula**. This sounds like a complex sci-fi term, but it simply means \"No Verb Needed\". Ukrainian is efficient. In the present tense, the verb \"to be\" (am, is, are) usually disappears! It exists in the past (\"was\") and future (\"will be\"), but right now, it is invisible.\nThis makes speaking Ukrainian surprisingly fast and direct. You just put two words together—Subject and Noun—and boom, you have a perfect sentence.\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> This \"Zero Copula\" feature is common in many languages, including Russian, Arabic, and Hebrew. It implies that being is the default state of existence. You don't need to *assert* that you \"ARE\" a student; simply stating \"I Student\" implies existence.\n>\n> However, there IS a word for \"is\" (**є**), but it is used only for emphatic definitions or philosophical statements (e.g., \"God is Love\" - *Бог є Любов*). Or in formal definitions: \"Kyiv is the capital of Ukraine\" (*Київ є столицею України*). But for everyday speech? Skip it!\n> *\"Я студент\"* is natural. *\"Я є студент\"* sounds like a robot or a philosopher trying to prove their existence.\n\n## presentation\n\n### 1. Subject Pronouns (The Actors)\n\nFirst, we need to know *who* is speaking. The pronouns are your avatars in the game of language.\n\n| English | Ukrainian | Pronunciation | Note |\n|---------|-----------|---------------|------|\n| **I** | **Я** | /ja/ | Sounds like \"Ya\" in \"Yard\". |\n| **You** (informal) | **Ти** | /tɪ/ | \"Ty\" (Like 'sit' but deeper). |\n| **He** | **Він** | /vin/ | \"Vin\" (Diesel). |\n| **She** | **Вона** | /vɔˈnɑ/ | \"Vo-na\" (Rhymes with 'Donna'). |\n| **It** | **Воно** | /vɔˈnɔ/ | \"Vo-no\". |\n| **We** | **Ми** | /mɪ/ | \"My\" (Like 'myth'). |\n| **You** (formal/plural) | **Ви** | /vɪ/ | \"Vy\" (Like 'visit'). |\n| **They** | **Вони** | /vɔˈnɪ/ | \"Vo-ny\". |\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: The Art of Politeness (Ty vs Vy)**\n>\n> The distinction between **Ти** (You-Singular) and **Ви** (You-Plural/Formal) is critical in Ukrainian society. It is not just grammar; it is social hierarchy.\n> - Use **Ти** with friends, children, family members, pets, and God (in prayer).\n> - Use **Ви** with strangers, elders, teachers, officials, and ANY group of people (even two children).\n>\n> **The Danger Zone:**\n> If you call your boss \"Ти\", you might get fired (or at least a stern look). If you call a young child \"Ви\", they will giggle because you sound too serious.\n> In Ukrainian culture, switching from \"Ви\" to \"Ти\" is a major milestone in a relationship. It usually happens after a shared experience, a drink, or simply asking: *\"Can we switch to Ty?\"* (*Може, перейдемо на ти?*). Until that moment, keep your \"Vy\" shield up!\n\n### 2. The Magic Word: Це (Tse)\n\n**Це** means \"This gets\" or \"It is\". It is your universal pointing word. It never changes. It doesn't care about gender. It is the finger you point with.\n- **Це** банк. (This is a bank).\n- **Це** мама. (This is mom).\n- **Це** не парк. (This is not a park).\n\nTo make a question, just change your intonation! Raise your voice at the end like you are asking a favor.\n- **Це** парк. (Statement: This is a park.) ↘\n- **Це** парк? (Question: Is this a park?) ↗\n\n### 3. Sentence Building (Subject + Predicate)\n\nSince we don't need \"is/am/are\", we just stick the pronoun and the noun together. This is the lego-block method of language learning.\n\n- I (am a) student. = **Я студент.**\n- He (is a) doctor. = **Він доктор.**\n- We (are) tourists. = **Ми туристи.**\n- They (are) actors. = **Вони актори.**\n\n> 🔍 **Deep Dive: The Feminitive Revolution**\n>\n> You might notice that \"Student\" is **Студент**, but a female student is **Студентка**.\n> In the Soviet era, official titles were often masculine-only (\"Doctor\", \"Director\", \"Engineer\"). But historically, Ukrainian has always had rich feminine forms for professions.\n> Today, Ukraine is experiencing a \"Feminitive Boom\". Using words like **Директорка** (female director), **Фотографиня** (female photographer), and **IT-шниця** (female IT specialist) is a way to make women visible in the language.\n> While our vocabulary list gives the base forms (usually masculine), know that for almost every profession, there is a dedicated female counterpart waiting to be used!\n\n## practice\n\nLet's practice the \"Zero Copula\". Translate literally in your head: \"She actor\".\n\n1. **Вона актриса.** (She is an actress).\n2. **Ти студент.** (You are a student).\n3. **Ми тут.** (We are here).\n4. **Ви там.** (You are there).\n\n**Negation**\nTo say \"not\", use **не**. Put it before the word you want to negate.\n- **Я не студент.** (I am not a student).\n- **Це не банк.** (This is not a bank).\n\n> 🎭 **Culture Corner**\n>\n> Ukrainians value titles and professions. When asking \"Hto tse?\" (Who is this?), the answer often defines the person by their role. \"Vatse likar\" (That is a doctor).\n>\n> **Conversation Etiquette:**\n> When you meet someone for the first time, the script is simple but strict:\n> 1. **Привіт!** (Hi - Casual) OR **Добрий день!** (Good day - Formal).\n> 2. **Як справи?** (How are things?). unlike in the US, \"How are things?\" is a real question. You can say \"Normal\" (*Нормально*), but don't just say \"Great\" if your house is on fire. Ukrainians value honesty (within reason).\n> 3. **Як вас звати?** (What is your name? Lit: How [do they] call you?).\n> 4. **Мене звати...** (My name is... Lit: Me [they] call...).\n>\n> Notice the passive construction \"Me they call\". It implies your name is something given to you by the world. It is less ego-centric than \"I AM [Name]\".\n\n## production\n\nLook at people around you (or imagine them).\n1. Point to yourself: **Я турист.** (I am a tourist).\n2. Point to a friend: **Ти друг.** (You are a friend).\n3. Point to a group: **Вони студенти.** (They are students).\n\nAsk questions:\n- **Хто це?** (Who is this?) -> **Це мама.**\n- **Що це?** (What is this?) -> **Це телефон.**\n\nThink like a Ukrainian. Remove the \"is\". Be direct. \"This - Bank\". \"I - Tourist\". Efficient, strong, simple.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---"

You can define the world: \"This is X, this is Y.\" You can introduce yourself and others: \"I am X, he is Y.\" You know the \"Zero Copula\" secret, which allows you to bypass complex verb conjugations for now. You also know that politeness matters (\"Ty\" vs \"Vy\"), and that almost every profession has a female form waiting to be used. In the next module, we will expand your world to \"My World\"—learning to say \"My book,\" \"Your coffee,\" and owning the things around you.\n",
