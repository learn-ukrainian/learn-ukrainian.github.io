No Google Maps.\nYou see a grandmother (Babusya) selling flowers.\nYou summon your courage.\n\"Excuse me... where is the Metro?\"\nShe points a shaking finger. \"Straight. Then left.\"\nYou survive.\n\nThis module is about **Urban Survival**. Reading signs, asking questions, and understanding the answers.\n\n## presentation\n\n### Section 1: The Magic Word (Excuse Me)\n\nBefore you ask, you must be polite.\nIn English, we say \"Excuse me\".\nIn Ukrainian, we have a few options:\n\n1.  **Перепрошую** (Pereproshuyu) - \"I over-beg\". Very polite. Use this if you bump into someone, interrupt them, or step on their foot.\n2.  **Вибачте** (Vybachte) - \"Forgive me\". Standard apology.\n3.  **Скажіть, будь ласка...** (Tell me please...). This is the most common way to start a question.\n    - \"Скажіть, будь ласка, де метро?\"\n\n### Section 2: Directions (Where to go?)\n\nYou ask \"Where is...?\" (Де...?).\nThey answer:\n\n- **Прямо** (Straight). Just keep walking.\n- **Ліворуч** (To the left). Think \"Liver\" (Left). Or \"Levy\" (Left).\n- **Праворуч** (To the right). Think \"Pravda\" (Truth is right).\n- **Назад** (Back). Turn around.\n\n> 💡 **Synonyms**\n> You might hear **Наліво** (To the left) and **Направо** (To the right).\n> These are common synonyms.\n> - **Ліворуч** is slightly more formal/literary (Left-hand-side).\n> - **Наліво** is purely directional.\n\n> 🇺🇦 **Deep Dive: The Street Name Change**\n> Many streets in Ukraine have new names since 2014/2022.\n> Lenin Street -> Freedom Street (Vulytsia Svobody).\n> Moscow Street -> Prince Ostrozky Street.\n> Maps (Google Maps) are usually updated, but older people might use old names.\n> \"De Lenina?\" \"Nemaye Lenina. Ye Svobody.\"\n\n\n\n### Section 3: The Imperative (Polite Commands)\n\nWhen people give directions, they tell you what to do.\nThey use the **Imperative Mood** (Command form).\nFor \"You\" (Vy - Formal), words usually end in **-іть**.\n\n- **Йти** (To go) -> **Йдіть** прямо. (Go straight).\n- **Повертати** (To turn) -> **Поверніть** направо. (Turn right).\n- **Дивитися** (To look) -> **Дивіться**. (Look).\n- **Чекати** (To wait) -> **Чекайте**. (Wait - sometimes -ayte).\n\n**Common Phrase:**\n\"Йдіть прямо, потім поверніть наліво.\" (Go straight, then turn left).\n\n### Section 4: Vital Signs\n\nYou need to read the city.\n\n1.  **Вхід** (Entrance). Memorize this. Green sign.\n2.  **Вихід** (Exit). Memorize this even more. No Exit? You are trapped.\n3.  **Каса** (Cashier/Ticket Office). Buy tickets here.\n4.  **Туалет** (Toilet). WC. Usually clear.\n5.  **Відчинено** (Open).\n6.  **Зачинено** (Closed).\n\n> 🕵️ **Deep Dive: The Entrance/Exit Trap**\n> **Вхід** looks like B-X-I-D.\n> **Вихід** looks like B-Y-X-I-D.\n> They look similar.\n> Look for the **H** (N) vs **И** (Y).\n> Or just follow the flow of people. If everyone is walking towards you, don't go there.\n\n\n> ⚡ **Language Link: Commands are Not Rude**\n> In English, \"Go straight\" sounds aggressive. We prefer \"Could you please go straight?\".\n> In Ukrainian, the Imperative (**Йдіть**, **Поверніть**) is the standard way to give directions.\n> It is not rude. It is efficient.\n> Politeness is carried by your tone and \"Будь ласка\" (Please).\n> Don't be afraid to command!\n\n### Section 5: Transport Types\n\n- **Метро** (Metro). The spine of the city. Fast. Cheap. Deep.\n- **Автобус** (Bus). Big.\n- **Тролейбус** (Trolleybus). Electric bus with wires. Eco-friendly. Slow.\n- **Трамвай** (Tram). Rails. Ding ding.\n- **Маршрутка** (Marshrutka). The wild card.\n\n> 🚌 **Deep Dive: The Marshrutka**\n> A yellow minibus. It goes where big buses cannot.\n> It stops anywhere (if you yell).\n> You pay cash to the driver. People pass money hand-to-hand from the back to the front.\n> If you are standing, you are part of the transaction chain.\n> \"Передайте за проїзд\" (Pass for the fare).\n\n### Section 6: Numbers in the Wild\n\nNavigating a city means dealing with numbers (which we will study deeper in Module 17, but you need them now).\nBus numbers often have letters.\n- **Автобус 24** (Twenty-four).\n- **Автобус 24-А** (Twenty-four A).\n- **Платформа 1** (Platform 1).\n- **Вагон 5** (Carriage 5).\n\n> 📱 **Deep Dive: The Digital Revolution**\n> Kyiv is a digital city.\n> You don't need tokens anymore.\n> Use **Kyiv Digital** app or just tap your credit card/phone at the turnstile.\n> \"Прикладіть карту\" (Tap the card).\n> QR codes are everywhere. Even grandma buys parsley with PayPass.\n\n\n### Section 7: The Ticket Inspection (Control)\n\nSometimes, the door opens and \"Control\" (Контроль) enters.\nThey wear uniforms. They want to see your ticket.\n- **\"Ваш квиток, будь ласка.\"** (Your ticket, please).\n- **\"Пред'явіть квиток.\"** (Present ticket).\n- **\"Штраф.\"** (Fine).\n\nIf you paid by phone, show your phone.\nIf you paid cash in a Marshrutka, you have no ticket.\nYou just say: \"Я передав\" (I passed [money]).\nIt works on the honor system. It is beautiful chaos.\n\n> 🎟️ **Cultural Insight: The Marshrutka Shout**\n> In a crowded marshrutka, you often cannot see the driver.\n> You must scream.\n> \"На зупинці!\" (At the stop!).\n> \"Зупиніть тут, будь ласка!\" (Stop here, please!).\n> If you are shy, you will ride forever. Open your mouth. \"НА ЗУПИНЦІ!\"\n\n\n> 🚇 **Culture Corner: The Metro Token**\n> For years, Kyiv Metro used plastic tokens (zhetony).\n> Now it's mostly QR codes or contactless (PayPass).\n> But you still see \"Жетони\" signs.\n> Old habits die hard.\n> To enter: \"Прикладіть картку\" (Attach the card).\n\n## practice\n\n**Drill 1: Left or Right?**\n- Ліворуч -> **Left**.\n- Праворуч -> **Right**.\n- Наліво -> **Left**.\n- Направо -> **Right**.\n- Прямо -> **Straight**.\n- Назад -> **Back**.\n- Вгору -> **Up** (Up the stairs).\n- Вниз -> **Down** (Down to the metro).\n- Поруч -> **Next to**.\n- Навпроти -> **Opposite**.\n\n**Drill 2: The Commander**\nTell them what to do (Formal).\n- (Turn) -> **Поверніть**.\n- (Go) -> **Йдіть**.\n- (Look) -> **Дивіться**.\n- (Wait) -> **Чекайте**.\n- (Stop) -> **Стійте**.\n- (Pass) -> **Передайте** (money).\n- (Show) -> **Покажіть** (ticket).\n- (Prepare) -> **Готуйте** (Prepare ticket).\n- (Sit) -> **Сідайте**.\n\n**Drill 3: Sign Reader**\nYou are walking down the street. It is night. You need to find shelter.\n- Green Sign -> **Вхід**.\n- Red Sign? -> Probably nothing standard, but **Вихід** is often lit up.\n- \"We are closed\" -> **Зачинено**.\n- \"Open\" -> **Відчинено**.\n- Ticket booth -> **Каса**.\n- Crossing -> **Перехід**.\n- Danger -> **Небезпечно** (Dangerous).\n- WC -> **Туалет**.\n\n## production\n\n\n> 🌍 **Culture Corner: The Underground Life**\n> In many Western cities, you cross the street at a zebra crossing.\n> In Kyiv (and post-Soviet cities), wide avenues often have **Underground Crossings** (Підземний перехід).\n> They are safer. They are warm in winter. They often have shops selling flowers, coffee, and socks.\n> Don't run across an 8-lane highway. Look for the \"Running Man down stairs\" sign.\n> Sometimes called just \"Перехід\".\n\n**Scenario: The Tourist and the Police**\n*   **Tourist:** Перепрошую, ви не знаєте, де Хрещатик?\n*   **Police:** Добрий день. Хрещатик там. (Points).\n*   **Tourist:** Це далеко? (Is it far?)\n*   **Police:** Ні, це близько. (No, near).\n*   **Police:** Йдіть прямо, потім поверніть ліворуч біля готелю.\n*   **Tourist:** Дивіться... там, де метро? (Look... there, where Metro is?)\n*   **Police:** Так. Там метро \"Театральна\". Хрещатик поруч.\n*   **Tourist:** Дякую!\n*   **Police:** Прошу. Гарного дня.\n\n**Scenario: In the Metro**\n*   **You:** Скажіть, будь ласка, де каса?\n*   **Local:** Каса там. Праворуч.\n*   **You:** А де вхід?\n*   **Local:** Вхід прямо. А вихід ліворуч.\n*   **You:** Дякую. Ви дуже люб'язні. (You are very kind).\n*   **Local:** Будь ласка.\n\n---"
