No change.\nWhy? Because they have no soul. They are just things.\n\nBut what if you point the laser at a person?\nA person has a soul. A person reacts.\nIn Ukrainian grammar, **Masculine People** are highly reactive.\nIf you do something to a man (see him, love him, ask him), you must mark him. You cannot treat him like a table.\n\n- **Non-Living:** Я бачу паспорт. (No change).\n- **Living:** Я бачу **студента**. (Change!).\n\nThis is the **Animate Accusative**.\n\n## presentation\n\n### Section 1: The Masculine Mark (+А)\n\nIf a Masculine noun refers to a person (or an animal), you add the ending **-А**.\nThis makes it look like the Genitive case (which we will learn later), but for now, just think: **Add -A for Life.**\n\n**The Pattern:**\n- Cononants add **-а**.\n- Soft signs (-ь) change to **-я**.\n- -Й changes to **-я**.\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Студент** ➡️ Я бачу **студента**.\n- **Брат** ➡️ Я маю **брата**.\n- **Син** (Son) ➡️ Вона любить **сина**.\n- **Лікар** ➡️ Ми шукаємо **лікаря** (Soft R).\n- **Андрій** ➡️ Я знаю **Андрія**.\n\n> 💡 **Deep Dive: The Logic**\n> Why mark the object?\n> In \"Boris hears Ivan\", both are masculine.\n> If grammar didn't change endings, \"Boris hear Ivan\" could mean \"Ivan hears Boris\" if word order was loose.\n> By saying \"Boris hears Ivan**a**\", we know 100% that Ivan is the target, no matter where he stands in the sentence.\n\n### Section 2: The \"Daddy\" Rule (Masculine -a)\n\nSome masculine words end in **-а** (like **Тато** - Dad, or names like **Микола**).\nGrammatically, they dress like women. They wear the \"-a\" ending.\nSo, they accept the Feminine rule!\n- Rule: **-А** ➡️ **-У**.\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Тато** (Dad) ➡️ Я люблю **тата**? NO! ➡️ Я люблю **тата** (Wait, Genitive?)\n  *Correction:* Masculine -a nouns in Accusative follow the Feminine Pattern (-a -> -u).\n  - Nominative: **Тато**.\n  - Accusative: **Тата**? No, let's check standard grammar.\n  - *Standard Ukrainian:* Тато (Nom) -> Тата (Acc/Gen).\n  - *Wait.* Feminine -a (Mama) -> Mamu.\n  - *Masculine -a* (Mikola) -> Mikolu. (Accusative).\n  - *Dad (Tato)*... actually, ends in -o.\n  - *Grandpa (Did)* -> Dida.\n  - *Colleague (Koleha - m)* -> Kolehu.\n\n  Let's stick to the clear ones:\n  - **Колега** (Colleague - m) ➡️ Я бачу **колегу**.\n  - **Микола** (Name) ➡️ Я бачу **Миколу**.\n  - **Тато**... historically -o nouns are 2nd declension, but *Tato* is often treated as mixed.\n  - Actually, **Тато** in Accusative is **Тата**. (Like inanimate neuter? No, animate masculine).\n  - 2nd Declension (Hard): Bat'ko -> Bat'ka. Syn -> Syna. Tato -> Tata.\n  - Ah, **Тато** ends in -o, not -a. It belongs to 2nd declension (mostly).\n  - Let's focus on **-a** nouns: **Колега**, **Микола**.\n  - And normal masculines: **Друг** -> **Друга**.\n\n### Section 3: Feminine People (Same Old Story)\n\nWomen are consistent.\nThe rule you learned for \"Pizza\" applies to \"Mama\".\n- **-А** ➡️ **-У**.\n- **-Я** ➡️ **-Ю**.\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Мама** ➡️ Я люблю **маму**.\n- **Сестра** ➡️ Я маю **сестру**.\n- **Подруга** (Girlfriend/Friend-f) ➡️ Я чекаю **подругу**.\n- **Марія** ➡️ Я знаю **Марію**.\n\n### Section 4: Who vs. What?\n\nNow you have two question words.\n- **Що?** (What?) -> For Things (Inanimate).\n- **Кого?** (Whom?) -> For People (Animate).\n\n*   **Q:** Що ти бачиш?\n    *   **A:** Автобус. (No change).\n*   **Q:** Кого ти бачиш?\n    *   **A:** Студент**а**. (Change!).\n\n> ⚡ **Language Link: Him and Her**\n> English does this too!\n> You don't say \"I see he\". You say \"I see **him**\".\n> You don't say \"I see she\". You say \"I see **her**\".\n> English only kept this \"Animate Accusative\" for pronouns. Ukrainian kept it for all masculine people.\n> - He -> Him (Він -> Його).\n> - Brother -> Brother + a (Брат -> Брата).\n\n### Section 5: The \"Love\" Verb (Kohaty vs Liubyty)\n\nIn the vocabulary list, you will see **Кохати** (To love).\nWait, didn't we learn **Любити**?\n- **Любити:** General love. I love pizza, I love mom, I love football.\n- **Кохати:** Romantic love. Only for a partner. Passion.\n- \"Я люблю борщ\" (Correct).\n- \"Я кохаю борщ\" (Very weird! Unless you want to marry the soup).\n- \"Я кохаю тебе\" (I love you - romantic).\n\n### Section 6: The Professional Search\n\nWhen you look for a professional, you use the Accusative.\nRemember that even if you don't know *which* doctor you want, grammar treats the concept of \"Doctor\" as a living, breathing goal.\n- \"Я шукаю **лікарЯ**\" (I am looking for a doctor).\n- \"Я шукаю **водіЯ**\" (I am looking for a driver).\n- \"Ми шукаємо **директорА**\" (We are looking for the director).\n\nYou are not looking for a \"Doctor Object\" (like a coat). You are looking for a \"Doctor Person\".\nThis distinction is crucial. It shows respect to the profession.\n\n\n> 🕵️ **Deep Dive: The Waiter Paradox**\n> If you scream \"Waiter!\" (Офіціант!), you use the **Vocative Case** (which we lightly touched on).\n> But if you ask \"Where is the waiter?\", you use Nominative.\n> And if you say \"I see the waiter\", you use Accusative: \"Я бачу **офіціантА**\".\n> Always treat service staff as Animate! \"Я бачу офіціант\" would imply he is a robot.\n\n> 🌍 **Culture Corner: The Guest**\n> In Ukraine, a Guest (**Гість**) is sacred.\n> You must welcome the guest: \"Я вітаю **гостя**\".\n> You must feed the guest: \"Я годую **гостя**\".\n> Note: **Гість** is soft masculine. It changes to **Гостя**.\n\n\n\n> 🎁 **Culture Corner: Gifts and Guests**\n> When visiting someone in Ukraine, never come empty-handed.\n> Bring something for \"Sim'ya\" (Accusative: Sim'yu).\n> \"Це для мами\" (Genitive - For mom).\n> \"Я купив торт\" (Accusative - I bought a cake).\n> The host will say \"Ой, не треба\" (Oh, not needed), but they expect it.\n\n## practice\n\n**Drill 1: The Soul Check**\nIs it Animate (Soul)?\n1.  **Стіл** -> No.\n2.  **Студент** -> Yes.\n3.  **Кіт** (Cat) -> Yes! (Animals are people too in grammar).\n4.  **Телефон** -> No.\n5.  **Робот** -> ...depends on the sci-fi movie. Grammatically usually inanimate.\n\n**Drill 2: The Transformation**\nMake them the object.\n- Це **Іван**. -> Я бачу **Івана**.\n- Це **Олена**. -> Я бачу **Олену**.\n- Це **директор**. -> Я бачу **директора**.\n- Це **лікар**. -> Я бачу **лікаря**.\n\n**Drill 3: Verb Pairs**\n- **Knowing People:** Я знаю **Ігоря**. (I know Ihor).\n- **Waiting:** Я чекаю **маму**. (I wait for Mom - *Note: Checkaty normally takes Accusative for definite people*).\n- **Loving:** Я люблю **тата**. (I love dad).\n\n## production\n\n**Deep Dive: \"To Know\" vs \"To Know\"**\nUkrainian has two verbs for \"to know\".\n1.  **Знати** (To know a fact or a person).\n    - Я знаю це. (I know this).\n    - Я знаю **Бориса**. (I know Borys).\n2.  **Вміти** (To know how / be able to).\n    - Я вмію плавати. (I know how to swim).\n    *We will focus on **Знати** today.*\n\n**Scenario: Who do you know?**\nYou are at a party.\n*   **Host:** Ти знаєш **Андрія**?\n*   **You:** Ні, я не знаю **Андрія**. (Genitive notation? Yes, negation triggers Genitive. But let's stay positive).\n*   **You:** Ні, але я знаю **Олега**.\n*   **Host:** А це **Марія**. Ти знаєш **Марію**?\n*   **You:** Так, я знаю **Марію**! Вона моя **колега**.\n\n> 🌍 **Cultural Note: Names and Respect**\n> We use **Pan** (Mr.) and **Pani** (Ms.).\n> They decline too!\n> - Я бачу **пана** Андрія.\n> - Я бачу **пані** Олену. (Pani is indeclinable).\n> - Я знаю **пана** директора.\n> Using \"Pan/Pani\" + First Name is very polite and common in Ukraine (e.g., \"Pani Oleno!\").\n\n> 🧠 **Deep Dive: Why Animals have Souls?**\n> In grammar, a \"Cat\" (Кіт) behaves like a person. \"Я бачу кота\".\n> A \"Dog\" (Собака - f) behaves like a woman. \"Я бачу собаку\".\n> But a \"Virus\" (Вірус)? Inanimate. \"Я бачу вірус\".\n> A \"Corpse\" (Труп)? Inanimate. \"Я бачу труп\".\n> A \"Ghost\" (Привид)? Animate! \"Я бачу привида\".\n> The line between life and death is grammatically ... interesting.\n\n---"

We need to know **Where** we are.\n\"I am **in** the park.\" \"I am **at** the concert.\"\nThis requires a new case. The **Locative Case**.\nGet your GPS ready!\n\n**Reflection:**\nYou might ask: \"Why is grammar so obsessed with life?\"\nBecause language is human. We care about who is doing what to whom.\nWhen you say \"Studenta\", you are not just following a rule; you are acknowledging that the student is a person capable of feeling the action.\nYou are giving them grammatical dignity. Resurrecting the noun from being a mere object.\nThat is the power of the Animate Accusative.\n\n# Vocabulary\n\n| Word | IPA | English | Note | Audio |\n|------|-----|---------|------|-------|\n| друг | /druh/ | friend (m) | | [🔊](audio_druh) |\n| подруга | /ˈpɔdruɦɑ/ | friend (f) | | [🔊](audio_podruha) |\n| колега | /kɔˈlɛɦɑ/ | colleague | m/f | [🔊](audio_koleha) |\n| сусід | /suˈs⁽ʲ⁾id/ | neighbor (m) | | [🔊](audio_susid) |\n| сусідка | /suˈs⁽ʲ⁾idkɑ/ | neighbor (f) | | [🔊](audio_susidka) |\n| лікар | /ˈlʲikɑr/ | doctor | | [🔊](audio_likar) |\n| вчитель | /ˈwtʃɪtɛlʲ/ | teacher (m) | | [🔊](audio_vchytel) |\n| студент | /stuˈdɛnt/ | student (m) | | [🔊](audio_student) |\n| студентка | /stuˈdɛntkɑ/ | student (f) | | [🔊](audio_studentka) |\n| офіціант | /ɔf⁽ʲ⁾iˈt͡s⁽ʲ⁾iɑnt/ | waiter | | [🔊](audio_oficiant) |\n| продавець | /prɔdɑˈvɛt͡sʲ/ | seller | | [🔊](audio_prodavec) |\n| водій | /vɔˈdij/ | driver | | [🔊](audio_vodij) |\n| пасажир | /pɑsɑˈʒɪr/ | passenger | | [🔊](audio_pasazhyr) |\n| гість | /h⁽ʲ⁾isʲtʲ/ | guest | | [🔊](audio_hist) |\n| директор | /dɪˈrɛktɔr/ | director | | [🔊](audio_dyrektor) |\n| брат | /brɑt/ | brother | | [🔊](audio_brat) |\n| сестра | /sɛsˈtrɑ/ | sister | | [🔊](audio_sestra) |\n| син | /sɪn/ | son | | [🔊](audio_syn) |\n| дочка | /dɔtʃˈkɑ/ | daughter | | [🔊](audio_dochka) |\n| кого | /kɔˈhɔ/ | whom | Q word | [🔊](audio_koho) |\n| знати | /ˈznɑtɪ/ | to know | | [🔊](audio_znaty) |\n| чекати | /tʃɛˈkɑtɪ/ | to wait | | [🔊](audio_chekaty) |\n| вітати | /v⁽ʲ⁾iˈtɑtɪ/ | to greet/congratulate | | [🔊](audio_vitaty) |\n| запитувати | /zɑˈpɪtuvɑtɪ/ | to ask | | [🔊](audio_zapytuvaty) |\n| кохати | /kɔˈxɑtɪ/ | to love (romantic) | | [🔊](audio_kokhaty) |\n| пан | /pɑn/ | Mr./Sir | | [🔊](audio_pan) |\n| пані | /ˈpɑn⁽ʲ⁾i/ | Ms./Madam | indecl. | [🔊](audio_pani) |\n",
