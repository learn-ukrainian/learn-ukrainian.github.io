They are open, loud, and energetic.\n\nToday, we meet their cousins: **Class II**.\n\n### The Personality of the \"Y-Team\"\n\nIf Class I verbs (like *Чита-є-ш*) are the \"E-Team\"—open, relaxed, flowing—then Class II verbs are the **\"Y-Team\"** (or \"I-Team\").\nThey are **sharp, precise, and active**.\n- Class I says \"**-ЄШ**\" (Yesh) -> Soft, like a breath.\n- Class II says \"**-ИШ**\" (Ysh) -> Hard, like a click.\n- Class I (They) says \"**-ЮТЬ**\" (Yut) -> Smooth.\n- Class II (They) says \"**-ЯТЬ**\" (Yat) -> Punchy.\n\nWhile Class I verbs often describe broad intellectual or state-based concepts (thinking, knowing, reading), Class II verbs drive your **immediate physical reality**. They control your **Senses** (seeing, hearing), your **Desires** (loving), and your **Actions** (doing, walking).\nYou cannot interact with the physical world without Class II.\n\nWhile Class I verbs often describe broad actions (reading, thinking, dreaming), Class II verbs generate the senses. They allow you to **see** (бачити), **speak** (говорити), **love** (любити), and **do** (робити).\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know? The Statistical Split**\n> About 70% of Ukrainian verbs are Class I, and 30% are Class II. You will meet Class I more often, but the Class II verbs are some of the most frequent and important words in the language. You cannot live without them!\n\n## presentation\n\n### Class II Verbs: The \"-ИТИ\" Family\n\nClass II verbs usually end in **-ИТИ** or **-ІТИ** in the dictionary.\nExample: **Говорити** (To speak).\n\n**Stem:** Говор-\n\n| Person | Pronoun | Ending | Verb Form | English | Audio |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|-------|\n| I | **Я** | **-ю** | говорю | I speak | [🔊](audio_hovoryu) |\n| You (sg) | **Ти** | **-иш** | говор**иш** | You speak | [🔊](audio_hovorysh) |\n| He/She | **Він/Вона** | **-ить** | говор**ить** | He/she speaks | [🔊](audio_hovoryts) |\n| We | **Ми** | **-имо** | говор**имо** | We speak | [🔊](audio_hovorymo) |\n| You (pl) | **Ви** | **-ите** | говор**ите** | You speak | [🔊](audio_hovoryte) |\n| They | **Вони** | **-ять** | говор**ять** | They speak | [🔊](audio_hovoryat) |\n\n**Compare the Rhythm:**\n- Class I: Чита-**Є**-мо (Open/Soft)\n- Class II: Говор-**И**-мо (Sharp/Hard)\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: The \"They\" Trap**\n> - Class I (They) = **-ЮТЬ** (Reads $\\rightarrow$ Chytayut)\n> - Class II (They) = **-ЯТЬ** (Speaks $\\rightarrow$ Hovoryat)\n> Listen for the **Yuta** vs **Yata** sound at the end.\n\n### Important Irregulars: Eating and Drinking\n\nTo survive, you need to eat and drink. These two verbs are rebels.\n\n1. **Пити** (To drink) acts like Class I!\n   - Я п'ю, Ти п'єш, Ми п'ємо, Вони п'ють. (Note the apostrophe!)\n\n2. **Їсти** (To eat) is its own ancient monster. Memorize it whole.\n   - **Я їм** (I eat)\n   - **Ти їси** (You eat)\n   - **Він їсть** (He eats)\n   - **Ми їмо** (We eat)\n   - **Ви їсте** (You eat)\n   - **Вони їдять** (They eat)\n\n### Deep Dive: The Senses & States\n\nClass II verbs are the engine of your experience. Let's look closer at the three most important ones.\n\n#### 1. Бачити (To see) vs. Дивитися (To watch)\n**Бачити** is the ability. You open your eyes, and you *see* the world.\n- \"Я бачу таксі.\" (I see a taxi.)\n- \"Ти бачиш проблему?\" (Do you see the problem?)\n\n**Дивитися** is the focus. It is active. You *watch* a movie or *look at* a painting.\n- *Note:* **Дивитися** is reflexive (ends in -ся). We will master reflexives later, but for now, just memorize: \"**Я дивлюся**\" (I watch).\n\n#### 2. Чути (To hear) vs. Слухати (To listen)\n**Чути** is the sense. Sounds enter your ears.\n- \"Я чую музику.\" (I hear music.)\n- \"Ви чуєте мене?\" (Do you hear me? - *Useful on Zoom calls!*)\n- *Warning:* **Чути** is a traitor! It looks like Class II, but often conjugates like Class I (Чує, Чують) in some dialects/standard variations, but for A1 simplification, treat the \"They\" form carefully. Actually, standard is **Чує** (Class I endings on stem)! So technically it's a **Class I** verb masquerading with a Class II sound. *Correction:* **Чути** takes -ю/-єш endings (Чую, Чуєш, Чують). It is a **Class I** verb in disguise! Let's allow it here as a \"Sense\" verb, but mark it: **It uses -Є-!**\n\n#### 3. Любити (The Spectrum of Love)\nIn English, \"Love\" is a heavy word. You love your spouse, but you \"like\" pizza.\nIn Ukrainian, **Любити** does it all.\n- \"Я люблю мою дружину.\" (I love my wife.) -> Romantic/Deep.\n- \"Я люблю борщ.\" (I like/love borsch.) -> Preference.\n- \"Я не люблю джаз.\" (I don't like jazz.) -> Opinion.\nIt is the ultimate verb for expressing your personality.\n\n### The \"Hospitality\" Verbs: Eating & Drinking\n\nTo survive in Ukraine, you must know how to accept (or refuse) food.\nHospitality is aggressive. You will be fed.\n\n**1. Їсти (To eat)**\nThis is an ancient, irregular beast. It refuses to follow the rules of Class I or Class II.\n- **Я їм** (I eat) -> Short, monosyllabic.\n- **Ти їси** (You eat) -> Very strange ending!\n- **Він їсть** (He eats) -> Ends in a soft sign sound.\n- **Вони їдять** (They eat) -> Looks like Class II (-ять).\n\n**2. Пити (To drink)**\nWait... \"Пити\"? The dictionary form looks like Class II (-ити).\nBut conjugation?\n- \"Я п'ю\" (I drink) -> With an apostrophe!\n- \"Ти п'єш\" (You drink) -> Class I ending!\n**Conclusion:** **Пити** is a **Class I** verb in a Class II costume. Don't trust the dictionary form alone!\n\n\n## practice\n\n**Drill 1: \"Do you talk?\"**\n- Q: Ти говориш українською? (Do you speak Ukrainian?)\n- A: Так, я трохи говорю. (Yes, I speak a little.)\n\n**Drill 2: \"What are you doing?\"**\n- Q: Що ти робиш? (What are you doing?)\n- A: Я нічого не роблю. (I am doing [nothing] [not]. - *Double negative!*)\n\n**Drill 3: The Picky Eater (Dialogue)**\n*Read this dialogue aloud.*\n\n**Андрій:** Ти хочеш їсти? (Do you want to eat?)\n**Марія:** Так, я дуже хочу їсти. Що ми маємо? (Yes, I really want to eat. What do we have?)\n**Андрій:** Я роблю салат. Ти любиш салат? (I am making a salad. Do you like salad?)\n**Марія:** Ні, я не люблю салат. Я люблю піцу. (No, I don't like salad. I love pizza.)\n**Андрій:** Але піци немає. Ти хочеш суп? (But there is no pizza. Do you want soup?)\n**Марія:** Добре. Я їм суп. (Fine. I eat soup.)\n\n> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: \"I'm Loving It\"**\n> McDonald's slogan \"I'm lovin' it\" in Ukraine is \"**Я це люблю**\" (I [this] love). Simple, direct, Class II verb.\n\n## production\n\nLook at the world through Class II eyes.\n\n1. **Sight:** Я **бачу**... (стіл, вікно). (I see...)\n2. **Action:** Я **роблю**... (каву, сніданок). (I am making...)\n3. **Speech:** Ми **говоримо**... (про політику, про погоду). (We are talking...)\n4. **Desire:** Я **хочу**... (пити, їсти). (I want...)\n\n---\n\n\n---"
