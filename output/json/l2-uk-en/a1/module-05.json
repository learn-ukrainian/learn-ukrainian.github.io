Whether you are pointing at a table, a lamp, or a window, it remains \"this.\" It's a simple, unchanging descriptor. But in Ukrainian, \"this\" is a linguistic chameleon. It changes its form to perfectly match the **grammatical gender** and **number** of the noun it describes.\n\nImagine a world where your \"pointing\" word doesn't just indicate proximity but also whispers the gender of the object.\n- If you point at a Masculine object (**стіл** - table), you say **ЦЕЙ** стіл.\n- If you point at a Feminine object (**лампа** - lamp), you say **ЦЯ** лампа.\n- If you point at a Neuter object (**вікно** - window), you say **ЦЕ** вікно.\n- If you point at multiple objects (**двері** - doors), you say **ЦІ** двері.\n\nThis is your first real step into **grammatical agreement** in its purest form. In Ukrainian, words don't just stand alone; they hold hands. Adjectives (like \"this\" or \"that\") must always match the gender and number of the noun they describe. This module will equip you to precisely label and identify the world around you, understanding not just \"what\" something is, but its linguistic \"essence.\"\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know? The Power of Agreement**\n> Grammatical agreement is a cornerstone of Ukrainian syntax. It helps maintain clarity in sentences, especially when word order is flexible. When you master agreement, you'll find that adjectives act like loyal companions, always adopting the characteristics of the noun they follow. This system, while initially challenging, adds a layer of precision and elegance to the language.\n\n## presentation\n\n### The \"This\" Family (Proximal Demonstratives)\nThese demonstrative adjectives are used for objects that are physically close to you, or conceptually \"here.\" They are the direct descendants of \"this\" in English.\n\n| Grammatical Gender | Form (Ukrainian) | Pronunciation | Example Noun | Full Phrase | English Translation | Audio |\n|--------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|\n| **Masculine**      | **ЦЕЙ**          | /tsej/        | стіл         | **Цей** стіл | This table          | [🔊](audio_tsey) |\n| **Feminine**       | **ЦЯ**           | /tsʲɑ/        | лампа        | **Ця** лампа | This lamp           | [🔊](audio_tsya) |\n| **Neuter**         | **ЦЕ**           | /tʃɛ/         | вікно        | **Це** вікно | This window         | [🔊](audio_tse_adj) |\n| **Plural**         | **ЦІ**           | /tʃi/         | двері        | **Ці** двері | These doors         | [🔊](audio_tsi) |\n\n**Key Rule of Agreement:**\nThe ending of **цей/ця/це/ці** changes to match the ending of the noun's gender.\n-   **Цей** (Masculine) matches Masculine nouns (consonant ending).\n-   **Ця** (Feminine) matches Feminine nouns (-а/-я ending).\n-   **Це** (Neuter) matches Neuter nouns (-о/-е ending).\n-   **Ці** (Plural) matches Plural nouns (various plural endings).\n\n### The \"That\" Family (Distal Demonstratives)\nThese demonstrative adjectives are used for objects that are further away from you, or conceptually \"there.\" They are the direct descendants of \"that\" or \"those\" in English.\n\n| Grammatical Gender | Form (Ukrainian) | Example Noun | Full Phrase | English Translation | Audio |\n|--------------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|\n| **Masculine**      | **ТОЙ**          | дім          | **Той** дім | That house          | [🔊](audio_toy) |\n| **Feminine**       | **ТА**           | жінка        | **Та** жінка | That woman          | [🔊](audio_ta) |\n| **Neuter**         | **ТЕ**           | море         | **Те** море | That sea            | [🔊](audio_te) |\n| **Plural**         | **ТІ**           | люди         | **Ті** люди | Those people        | [🔊](audio_ti) |\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Visual Mnemonic**\n> -   Think of **Ц** (Ts) as a pointer with a short, sharp sound, keeping things **Ц**lose (Close).\n> -   Think of **Т** (T) as a sound that pushes things away, pointing **Т**here (There).\n> This simple phonetic trick can help you remember which family to use for proximity.\n\n### Deep Dive: The Rhythm of Agreement\nGrammatical agreement is more than just a rule; it creates a rhyming rhythm in the language. Listen to the vowels!\n- **Feminine Rhythm:** Ц**я** мам**а**, Т**а** ламп**а**. (Ah... Ah...)\n- **Neuter Rhythm:** Ц**е** мор**е**, Т**е** сонц**е**. (Eh... Eh...)\n- **Plural Rhythm:** Ц**і** люд**и**, Т**і** двер**і**. (Ee... Ee...)\n- **Masculine Rhythm:** Цей дім, Той стіл. (Consonant endings, sharp and solid).\n\nLearning to \"hear\" this rhyme will help you spot mistakes faster than thinking about gender rules. If it *sounds* flowy and rhymes, it's likely correct!\n\n> 🎭 **Culture Corner: Gift Giving**\n> When you give a gift in Ukraine, you might say \"**Це** тобі\" (This is for you). But if you hand over a specific object, you use the demonstrative!\n> - handing over flowers: \"**Ці** квіти для тебе.\"\n> - handing over a book: \"**Ця** книга для тебе.\"\n> Precision shows care!\n\n### Distinguishing Це as Pronoun vs. Adjective\nBe careful! The word **Це** has two distinct functions:\n1.  **Invariant Pronoun \"This is\":** As we learned in Module 04, **Це** means \"This is / It is / These are.\" It **never changes** its form and introduces a noun.\n    *   **Це стіл.** (This is a table.)\n    *   **Це лампа.** (This is a lamp.)\n    *   **Це вікно.** (This is a window.)\n2.  **Neuter Adjective \"This\":** **Це** also means \"this\" specifically for **Neuter nouns**.\n    *   **Це вікно** велике. (This window is big.)\n\nThe context usually makes it clear. If **Це** is immediately followed by a noun that *doesn't* match its neuter form, it's functioning as \"This is.\" If it's followed by a neuter noun, it could be either, but often \"this is\" is implied.\n\n##\n---\n\n\n---"

You grab **цей** хліб.\n-   You see **вода** (water, F). You pick **цю** воду.\n-   You see **молоко** (milk, N). You choose **це** молоко.\n-   You see some **фрукти** (fruit, Pl). You point to **ці** фрукти.\n\n## production\n\nLook around your actual room right now. Point to 5 objects, naming them in Ukrainian using the correct demonstrative adjective.

The ending matches.\n\n- [ ] \"Це\" is only used for Neuter nouns.\n  > Incorrect. \"Це\" is used for Neuter nouns (\"Це вікно\") BUT ALSO as the invariant subject \"This is\" for ANY gender (\"Це мама\"). Context matters!\n\n- [x] \"Ті\" is the plural for \"Those\".\n  > Correct.\n\n- [ ] \"Та\" is used for Masculine nouns that are far away.\n  > Incorrect. \"Та\" is for Feminine nouns far away. \"Той\" is for Masculine nouns far away.\n\n- [x] Demonstrative adjectives must agree with the noun's gender and number.\n  > Correct. This is the core rule of agreement.\n\n- [ ] The word \"Це\" always changes its form.\n  > Incorrect. As the subject \"This is\", \"Це\" is invariant. It only changes form when acting as a neuter demonstrative adjective.\n\n- [x] If a noun ends in -a, it will use \"Ця\" or \"Та\".\n  > Correct (for singular feminine nouns).\n\n- [ ] The demonstrative for a plural noun is always \"Це\".\n  > Incorrect. For plural nouns, it's \"Ці\" (near) or \"Ті\" (far).\n\n- [x] \"Цей\" and \"Той\" are used for Masculine nouns.\n  > Correct. They indicate near and far for masculine nouns.\n\n- [ ] \"Стіл\" uses the demonstrative \"Ця\".\n  > Incorrect. \"Стіл\" is Masculine, so it uses \"Цей\".\n\n- [x] \"Кімната\" uses the demonstrative \"Ця\".\n  > Correct. \"Кімната\" is Feminine, so it uses \"Ця\".\n\n- [ ] \"Вікно\" uses the demonstrative \"Цей\".\n  > Incorrect. \"Вікно\" is Neuter, so it uses \"Це\".\n\n## match-up: Proximity Check\n\n> Match the Ukrainian demonstrative to its English meaning, including proximity.\n\n| Left | Right |\n|------|-------|\n| Цей | This (Masculine, Near) |\n| Ця | This (Feminine, Near) |\n| Це | This (Neuter, Near) |\n| Ці | These (Plural, Near) |\n| Той | That (Masculine, Far) |\n| Та | That (Feminine, Far) |\n| Те | That (Neuter, Far) |\n| Ті | Those (Plural, Far) |\n| Діалог | Dialogue |\n| Віза | Visa |\n| Карта | Map |\n| Опера | Opera |\n\n---\n\n# Vocabulary\n\n| Word | IPA | English | POS | Gender | Note | Audio |\n|------|-----|---------|-----|--------|------|-------|\n| цей | /tsej/ | this (m) | pron | m | | [🔊](audio_tsey) |\n| ця | /tsʲɑ/ | this (f) | pron | f | | [🔊](audio_tsya) |\n| це | /tʃɛ/ | this (n) | pron | n | | [🔊](audio_tse) |\n| ці | /tʃi/ | these | pron | pl | | [🔊](audio_tsi) |\n| той | /tɔj/ | that (m) | pron | m | | [🔊](audio_toy) |\n| та | /tɑ/ | that (f) | pron | f | | [🔊](audio_ta) |\n| те | /tɛ/ | that (n) | pron | n | | [🔊](audio_te) |\n| ті | /tʲi/ | those | pron | pl | | [🔊](audio_ti) |\n| чашка | /ˈtʃɑʃkɑ/ | cup | noun | f | | [🔊](audio_chashka) |\n| ложка | /ˈlɔʒkɑ/ | spoon | noun | f | | [🔊](audio_lozhka) |\n| виделка | /vɪˈdɛlkɑ/ | fork | noun | f | | [🔊](audio_vydelka) |\n| ніж | /nʲiʒ/ | knife | noun | m | | [🔊](audio_nizh) |\n| тарілка | /tɑˈrʲilkɑ/ | plate | noun | f | | [🔊](audio_tarilka) |\n| склянка | /ˈsklʲɑnkɑ/ | glass | noun | f | | [🔊](audio_sklyanka) |\n| пляшка | /ˈplʲɑʃkɑ/ | bottle | noun | f | | [🔊](audio_plyashka) |\n| сумка | /ˈsumkɑ/ | bag | noun | f | | [🔊](audio_sumka) |\n| рюкзак | /rʲukˈzɑk/ | backpack | noun | m | | [🔊](audio_ryukzak) |\n| гаманець | /ɦɑmɑˈnɛtsʲ/ | wallet | noun | m | | [🔊](audio_hamanets) |\n| телефон | /tɛlɛˈfɔn/ | phone | noun | m | | [🔊](audio_telefon) |\n| комп'ютер | /kɔmˈpju.tɛr/ | computer | noun | m | | [🔊](audio_kompyuter) |\n| ключ | /klʲutʃ/ | key | noun | m | | [🔊](audio_klyuch) |\n| вікно | /vʲiˈknɔ/ | window | noun | n | | [🔊](audio_vikno) |\n| стіна | /sʲtʲiˈnɑ/ | wall | noun | f | | [🔊](audio_stina) |\n| лампа | /ˈlɑmpɑ/ | lamp | noun | f | | [🔊](audio_lampa) |\n| стілець | /sʲtʲiˈlɛtsʲ/ | chair | noun | m | | [🔊](audio_stilets) |\n| крісло | /ˈkrʲislɔ/ | armchair | noun | n | | [🔊](audio_krislo) |\n| диван | /dɪˈvɑn/ | sofa | noun | m | | [🔊](audio_dyvan) |\n| ліжко | /ˈlʲiʒkɔ/ | bed | noun | n | | [🔊](audio_lizhko) |\n| шафа | /ˈʃɑfɑ/ | wardrobe | noun | f | | [🔊](audio_shafa) |\n| холодильник | /xɔlɔˈdɪlʲnɪk/ | fridge | noun | m | | [🔊](audio_kholodylnyk) |\n\n# Summary\n\nYou have now labeled your world. You have mastered the art of pointing with grammatical precision!\n1.  **Proximal (Near):** Use **Цей, Ця, Це, Ці** (This / These).\n2.  **Distal (Far):** Use **Той, Та, Те, Ті** (That / Those).\n3.  **The Golden Rule of Agreement:** The demonstrative adjective (Цей/Той) must perfectly match the **grammatical gender** (Masculine, Feminine, Neuter) and **number** (Singular, Plural) of the noun it describes.\n\nYou can now walk into any room and confidently point at objects, knowing your words will agree perfectly. In the next module, we will finally learn how to make these objects *do* something. We will unlock the power of verbs!\n",
