You have completed the first phase of your Ukrainian journey: **First Contact (A1.1)**.\n\nLook back at where you started just ten modules ago.\nCyrillic was a collection of alien signals. You deciphered them. You learned that **Р** is usually an R, not a P. You learned that **Х** is a sound of friction, not a kiss. You learned that the alphabet is not a wall, but a gate.\n\nThen you entered the **Matrix of Gender**. You learned that the world is divided into He (M), She (F), and It (N), and that the end of the word is the key to this code. You realized that words dance and change.\n\nYou built the **Engines of Action**. You mastered Class I verbs (like a breath of air) and Class II verbs (like a sharp click). You learned to say \"I am,\" \"I want,\" \"I see,\" and \"I love.\" You moved from being a spectator to a player only through the power of conjugation.\n\nAnd finally, you learned **Interaction**. You learned to ask \"Who?\" \"Where?\" and \"Why?\"—the three keys that open any conversation. You learned to navigate the table with food and drink.\n\n> 💡 **The Language Learning Curve**\n> Learning a language is not a straight line. It is a series of plateaus and steep climbs. You have just finished the first steep climb. You might feel tired. You might feel like you don't know enough. That is normal. The fact that you understand *what you don't know* is proof of progress!\n\n## presentation\n\n### Review A: The Logic of Gender\n\nEverything in Ukrainian has a gender. It is not biological; it is grammatical. It is the rhythm of the language.\n\n**The Golden Rules:**\n1.  **Masculine (Він):** Hard. Ends in a consonant. Use \"Мій\" (My), \"Цей\" (This).\n    *   *Symphony:* Стіл, Банк, Парк, Телефон.\n2.  **Feminine (Вона):** Open. Ends in -А or -Я. Use \"Моя\" (My), \"Ця\" (This).\n    *   *Symphony:* Кава, Віза, Земля, Музика.\n3.  **Neuter (Воно):** Round. Ends in -О or -Е. Use \"Моє\" (My), \"Це\" (This).\n    *   *Symphony:* Вікно, Море, Місто, Сонце.\n\n> ⚡ **The Exceptions to Watch**\n> - **Тато** (Dad) ends in -А, but is Masculine (biological).\n> - **Ніч** (Night) ends in a soft sign, but is Feminine.\n> - **Ім'я** (Name) ends in -Я, but is Neuter (special group)!\n\n### Review B: The Engine of Action (Verbs)\n\nYou met the two great families of the Present Tense.\n\n**Class I (-Є- Team)**\nThese verbs are open, soft, and relaxed. They dominate the language (70%).\n*Conjugation Signal:* **-Ю / -ЄШ / -ЮТЬ**.\n*Heroes:* Читати, Знати, Думати, Розуміти.\n\n**Class II (-И- Team)**\nThese verbs are sharp, precise, and physical. They control your senses and your body.\n*Conjugation Signal:* **-Ю / -ИШ / -ЯТЬ**.\n*Heroes:* Говорити, Робити, Бачити, Любити.\n\n> 🎭 **Activity: Be the Teacher**\n> Explain to an imaginary student why \"Я бачу\" (I see) is correct, but \"Ти бачЄш\" is wrong.\n> Answer: Because \"Бачити\" is Class II! It must be sharp: \"Ти бачИш\". The logic is strict.\n\n### Deep Dive: The Philosophy of Gender\n\nWhy does a table have to be a \"He\" and a lamp a \"She\"? It seems unnecessary to an English speaker.\nBut in Ukrainian, gender is the **DNA of the sentence**. It determines how adjectives dress (\"Гарна кава\" vs \"Гарний чай\"). It determines how verbs move in the past tense (which we will learn in Phase 3). It creates a web of connections that makes poetry and song incredibly rich.\nWhen you say \"Моя добра подруга\" (My good friend [f]), every word rhymes and agrees. It is not just grammar; it is rhyme.\n\n> 🔗 **Language Link: The Road Ahead (Cases)**\n> You have mastered the **Nominative Case** (The Dictionary Form). This is the \"subject\" form (Who is doing the action?).\n> In Phase A1.2, you will unlock the **Accusative Case** (The Object).\n> - You know: \"Це вода\" (This is water - Nominative).\n> - You will learn: \"Я хочу вод**у**\" (I want water - Accusative).\n> The word changes because the grammatical relationship changes. Get ready!\n\n### Review C: The Questions & Negation\n\nTo speak is to interrogate. You need the \"W\" words (which are mostly \"K\" words in Ukrainian).\n\n*   **Хто?** (Who?) - Use for people.\n*   **Що?** (What?) - Use for things.\n*   **Де?** (Where?) - Use for location (Static).\n*   **Куди?** (Where to?) - Use for direction (Dynamic).\n*   **Чому?** (Why?) - The philosopher's question.\n*   **Як?** (How?) - The mechanic's question.\n\nAnd never forget **НЕ** (Not). In Ukrainian, negation is simple but powerful. It stands like a guard immediately before the verb.\n\"Я **не** знаю.\" (I **not** know).\n\n### Review D: The Food & Interaction\n\nLanguage is not just grammar; it is survival. You learned to say \"I want\" (**Я хочу**) and \"Give me\" (**Дайте** - though \"I want\" is often enough with a polite tone!). You learned that food is culture.\n\n> 💡 **The Survival Check**\n> If you can say:\n> 1.  \"Добрий день.\"\n> 2.  \"Я хочу каву.\"\n> 3.  \"Дякую.\"\n> You can survive in Kyiv. Everything else is a bonus.\n\n## practice\n\n**Drill 1: The Gender Instinct**\nDon't think. Just react. Is it He, She, or It?\n- **Стіл** (Table) -> Hard sound -> **He**.\n- **Вода** (Water) -> A sound -> **She**.\n- **Вікно** (Window) -> O sound -> **It**.\n- **Дядько** (Uncle) -> Ends in O, BUT means a man -> **He** (Biological Gender wins!).\n\n**Drill 2: The Conjugation Rhythm**\nClass I flows. Class II hits.\n- **Чита...** -> **ЮТЬ** (Flow: Chytayut).\n- **Говор...** -> **ЯТЬ** (Hit: Hovoryat).\n- **Пи...** -> **ТЬ**? No! **П'ЮТЬ** (Irregular flow).\n\n**Drill 3: The Question Logic**\nYou have the answer. What is the question?\n- Answer: \"Я вдома.\" (I am at home).\n- Question: \"**Де** ти?\" (Where are you?)\n- Answer: \"Це брат.\" (This is brother).\n- Question: \"**Хто** це?\" (Who is this?)\n\n## production\n\n**Scenario 1: The Introduction**\nYou are at a party. Introduce yourself.\n*   **You:** Привіт! Я [Name]. Я студент/турист.\n*   **Stranger:** Дуже приємно. Я Олена.\n*   **You:** Я з Америки/Англії. А ти?\n\n**Scenario 2: The Order**\nYou are hungry.\n*   **Waiter:** Добрий день.\n*   **You:** Добрий день. Я хочу меню, будь ласка.\n*   **Waiter:** Ось меню.\n*   **You:** Я буду борщ і салат. І воду.\n*   **Waiter:** Смачного!\n*   **You:** Дякую!\n\n**Scenario 3: The Denial**\nSomeone offers you something you hate.\n*   **Friend:** Ти хочеш горілку? (Do you want vodka?)\n*   **You:** Ні, я **не** хочу. Я **не** п'ю горілку.\n*   **Friend:** Чому?\n*   **You:** Я не люблю. Це не смачно.\n*   *(Be strong! Use your negation!)*\n\n---"
