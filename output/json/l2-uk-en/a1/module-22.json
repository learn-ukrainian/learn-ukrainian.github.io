        "content": "> **Note:** Ready to talk about tomorrow? Ukrainian compound future is refreshingly simple — one auxiliary verb and the infinitive!\n\n## Warm-up: What Will You Do Tomorrow?\n\nAfter learning the past tense, you can now tell stories about what happened. But what about tomorrow? Next week? Your future plans?\n\nUkrainian has two ways to express the future:\n\n1. **Compound future:** буду + infinitive (imperfective verbs) — \"I will be doing\"\n2. **Simple future:** Perfective verb forms — \"I will do\" (one-time action)\n\nToday we focus on the compound future, which is the most common and easiest to form. It works exactly like English \"I will be reading\" — you just need the helper verb \"буду\" (will be) plus the infinitive.\n\nThe compound future is used for ongoing or repeated future actions, plans, and processes. It's perfect for everyday conversation about what you're going to do.\n\nUkrainian speakers also love to express intentions using special verbs like \"збираюся\" (I'm going to) and \"планую\" (I'm planning to). These add nuance to your future expressions and make you sound more natural!\n\nThink about your plans for tomorrow. После цього модуля, ви зможете описати їх українською!\n\n> 💡 **Thinking Trick:** буду + infinitive = \"I will be [verb]ing.\" The \"буду\" conjugates for person, while the infinitive stays the same. Simple!\n\n## Presentation: Compound Future\n\n### буду: The Future Helper\n\nThe verb \"буду\" conjugates for person (like present tense verbs):\n\n| Person | буду form |\n|--------|-----------|\n| я | буду |\n| ти | будеш |\n| він/вона/воно | буде |\n| ми | будемо |\n| ви | будете |\n| вони | будуть |\n\n**Formation:** буду (conjugated) + infinitive\n\n**Examples:**\n- Я буду читати. (I will read / will be reading.)\n- Ти будеш працювати. (You will work / will be working.)\n- Вона буде вивчати українську. (She will study Ukrainian.)\n- Ми будемо подорожувати. (We will travel.)\n- Ви будете обідати? (Will you have lunch?)\n- Вони будуть чекати. (They will wait.)\n\n### Common Verbs in Future\n\n| Infinitive | Meaning | Future (я) |\n|------------|---------|------------|\n| читати | to read | буду читати |\n| працювати | to work | буду працювати |\n| говорити | to speak | буду говорити |\n| їсти | to eat | буду їсти |\n| пити | to drink | буду пити |\n| спати | to sleep | буду спати |\n| гуляти | to walk | буду гуляти |\n| вивчати | to study | буду вивчати |\n\n> 📜 **Pattern Summary:**\n> - **Compound future:** буду/будеш/буде/будемо/будете/будуть + infinitive\n> - Works with ALL imperfective verbs\n> - The infinitive never changes — only \"буду\" conjugates!\n\n### Time Expressions for the Future\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| завтра | tomorrow |\n| післязавтра | day after tomorrow |\n| наступного тижня | next week |\n| наступного місяця | next month |\n| наступного року | next year |\n| скоро | soon |\n| потім | later, then |\n| пізніше | later |\n| згодом | eventually, soon |\n| незабаром | soon, shortly |\n\n**Example sentences:**\n- Завтра я буду працювати. (Tomorrow I will work.)\n- Наступного тижня ми будемо в Одесі. (Next week we will be in Odesa.)\n- Скоро все буде добре. (Soon everything will be okay.)\n- Пізніше я буду готувати вечерю. (Later I will cook dinner.)\n\n### Expressing Intentions\n\nBeyond \"буду,\" Ukrainians use special verbs to express intentions:\n\n| Verb | Meaning | Example |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| збираюся | I'm going to | Я збираюся вчитися. |\n| планую | I'm planning to | Я планую поїхати. |\n| хочу | I want to | Я хочу побачити. |\n| маю намір | I intend to | Я маю намір закінчити. |\n| сподіваюся | I hope to | Я сподіваюся приїхати. |\n| обіцяю | I promise to | Я обіцяю зробити. |\n\n**Key difference:**\n- \"Буду читати\" = I will read (neutral statement)\n- \"Збираюся читати\" = I'm going to read (intention, plan)\n- \"Планую читати\" = I'm planning to read (deliberate decision)\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?** \"Збиратися\" literally means \"to gather oneself\" — you're gathering yourself to do something! It's like English \"I'm getting ready to...\" or \"I'm about to...\"\n\n## Cultural Insight: Future Plans in Ukraine 🇺🇦\n\nUkrainians are practical and often cautious about making definite future plans. After decades of Soviet instability and recent war, many prefer phrases like:\n\n- \"Якщо все буде добре...\" (If all goes well...)\n- \"Як Бог дасть...\" (God willing... — very common!)\n- \"Можливо, я буду...\" (Maybe I will...)\n\nThis isn't pessimism — it's wisdom! Ukrainians have learned that life can change quickly.\n\n**Planning vocabulary:**\n- план (plan)\n- мрія (dream)\n- мета (goal)\n- намір (intention)\n- рішення (decision)\n\n> 📜 **History Bite:** During Soviet times, Ukrainians had little control over their future — the state decided where you worked, lived, and even what language you spoke. The phrase \"плануємо\" (we're planning) was often met with the joke \"Хочете розсмішити Бога — розкажіть Йому про свої плани\" (Want to make God laugh? Tell Him your plans). Today, independent Ukraine rebuilds with hope despite challenges!\n\n> 📜 **Myth Buster:** Some claim Ukrainians are \"fatalistic.\" The truth: Ukrainians combine pragmatism with incredible resilience. They plan, dream, and build — but stay flexible. The phrase \"будемо бачити\" (we'll see) reflects wisdom, not passivity!\n\n## Reading Practice: Мої плани на завтра 📖\n\n**Українською:**\n\nСьогодні понеділок. Завтра буде вівторок. У мене багато планів!\n\nЗранку я буду працювати. О дев'ятій починається робота. Буду писати звіт і відповідати на листи. Потім буду обідати з колегами. Ми збираємося піти в нове кафе біля офісу.\n\nВвечері я буду вивчати українську мову. Я планую прочитати новий текст і зробити вправи. Потім буду готувати вечерю. Я хочу приготувати борщ — перший раз!\n\nО десятій я буду вже спати. Завтра буде довгий день!\n\n**English Translation:**\n\nToday is Monday. Tomorrow will be Tuesday. I have a lot of plans!\n\nIn the morning, I will work. At nine, work starts. I will write a report and answer emails. Then I will have lunch with colleagues. We're going to go to a new café near the office.\n\nIn the evening, I will study the Ukrainian language. I'm planning to read a new text and do exercises. Then I will cook dinner. I want to make borscht — for the first time!\n\nAt ten, I will already be sleeping. Tomorrow will be a long day!\n\n**Practice:** What are YOUR plans for tomorrow? Write 3-5 sentences using \"буду + infinitive.\"\n\n## Conversation: Що будеш робити? 🗣️\n\n**Ольга:** Привіт! Що будеш робити у вихідні?\n**Андрій:** Привіт! У суботу буду відпочивати.\n**Ольга:** А в неділю?\n**Андрій:** В неділю збираюся поїхати за місто. А ти?\n**Ольга:** Я буду працювати в суботу. Але в неділю планую зустрітися з друзями.\n**Андрій:** Супер! Де будете зустрічатися?\n**Ольга:** Ми будемо в парку, якщо буде гарна погода.\n**Андрій:** Чудово! Тоді гарно провести час!\n**Ольга:** Дякую! Тобі також!\n\n**English Translation:**\n**Olha:** Hi! What will you be doing on the weekend?\n**Andriy:** Hi! On Saturday I will rest.\n**Olha:** And on Sunday?\n**Andriy:** On Sunday I'm going to go out of town. And you?\n**Olha:** I will work on Saturday. But on Sunday I plan to meet with friends.\n**Andriy:** Super! Where will you meet?\n**Olha:** We will be in the park, if the weather is good.\n**Andriy:** Wonderful! Have a good time then!\n**Olha:** Thank you! You too!\n\nЗверни увагу: буду/будеш/будемо + інфінітив — майбутній час!"
