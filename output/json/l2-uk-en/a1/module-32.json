Who are the most important people? Parents, siblings, grandparents, cousins?\n\nFamily vocabulary is some of the most essential vocabulary in any language. In Ukraine, family ties are very strong — people often live with or near extended family, and gatherings include many generations.\n\nUkrainian has distinct words for maternal and paternal relatives, which English often lacks. For example, \"бабуся\" can refer to either grandmother, but \"баба по маминій лінії\" specifies mother's mother. This reflects the importance of lineage in Ukrainian culture.\n\nFamily vocabulary also connects to possessives you've already learned: \"мій батько\" (my father), \"моя мама\" (my mother), \"мої батьки\" (my parents).\n\nBy mastering this module, you'll be able to introduce your family, describe relationships, and participate in conversations about one of the most important topics in Ukrainian society!\n\n> 💡 **Thinking Trick:** Family terms follow gender naturally: \"брат\" (brother, m.) → \"мій брат\"; \"сестра\" (sister, f.) → \"моя сестра.\"\n\n## Presentation: Family Members\n\n### Immediate Family (Найближча родина)\n\n| Ukrainian | IPA | English |\n|-----------|-----|---------|\n| сім'я | /simˈjɑ/ | family |\n| родина | /roˈdɪnɑ/ | family (extended) |\n| батько / тато | /ˈbɑtʲko/, /ˈtɑto/ | father / dad |\n| мати / мама | /ˈmɑtɪ/, /ˈmɑmɑ/ | mother / mom |\n| батьки | /bɑtʲˈkɪ/ | parents |\n| син | /sɪn/ | son |\n| дочка | /ˈdot͡ʃkɑ/ | daughter |\n| діти | /ˈditɪ/ | children |\n| брат | /brɑt/ | brother |\n| сестра | /sɛsˈtrɑ/ | sister |\n\n### Extended Family (Розширена родина)\n\n| Ukrainian | IPA | English |\n|-----------|-----|---------|\n| дідусь | /diˈdusʲ/ | grandfather |\n| бабуся | /bɑˈbusʲɑ/ | grandmother |\n| дядько | /ˈdʲɑdʲko/ | uncle |\n| тітка (тьотя) | /ˈtitkɑ/ | aunt |\n| племінник | /plɛˈminnɪk/ | nephew |\n| племінниця | /plɛˈmɪnnɪt͡sʲɑ/ | niece |\n| двоюрідний брат | /dʋojuˈridnɪj brɑt/ | cousin (male) |\n| двоюрідна сестра | /dʋojuˈridnɑ sɛsˈtrɑ/ | cousin (female) |\n| онук | /oˈnuk/ | grandson |\n| онучка | /oˈnut͡ʃkɑ/ | granddaughter |\n| внуки | /ˈʋnukɪ/ | grandchildren |\n\n> 📜 **Pattern Summary:**\n> - Male relatives often end in consonant (брат, син)\n> - Female relatives often end in -а/-я (сестра, дочка)\n> - \"Батьки\" (parents) is always plural\n\n### In-Laws (Родичі по лінії)\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| свекруха | mother-in-law (husband's mother) |\n| теща | mother-in-law (wife's mother) |\n| свекор | father-in-law (husband's father) |\n| тесть | father-in-law (wife's father) |\n| чоловік | husband |\n| дружина (жінка) | wife |\n| зять | son-in-law |\n| невістка | daughter-in-law |\n\n### Describing Relationships\n\n| Ukrainian | English |\n|-----------|---------|\n| старший | older |\n| молодший | younger |\n| одружений/одружена | married (m/f) |\n| неодружений | single (unmarried) |\n| розлучений/розлучена | divorced (m/f) |\n\n**Example sentences:**\n- Це мій старший брат.

Я їх дуже люблю!\n\nМоя молодша сестра Катерина ще не одружена. Вона студентка, живе в Києві.\n\nМої бабуся і дідусь живуть у селі. Влітку ми часто їздимо до них. Бабуся готує найсмачніший борщ!\n\nЯ люблю свою родину. Ми часто збираємося разом на свята.\n\n**English Translation:**\n\nHello! I want to tell you about my family.\n\nMy family is not big.

She's a student, lives in Kyiv.\n\nMy grandmother and grandfather live in the village. In summer we often go to them. Grandma makes the most delicious borscht!\n\nI love my family.

А бабусі й дідусі?\n**Марія:** На жаль, тільки одна бабуся ще жива. Їй вісімдесят років!\n**Іван:** Нехай буде здорова!\n\n**English Translation:**\n**Ivan:** Do you have a big family?\n**Maria:** Quite big. I have three brothers and one sister.\n**Ivan:** Wow! And parents?\n**Maria:** Yes, parents are alive and healthy, thank God.\n**Ivan:** And are you married?\n**Maria:** Yes, I have a husband and two children.\n**Ivan:** How old are they?\n**Maria:** The son is seven, and the daughter is five.\n**Ivan:** Wonderful! And grandmothers and grandfathers?\n**Maria:** Unfortunately, only one grandmother is still alive.
