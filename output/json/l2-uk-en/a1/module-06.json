        "content": "До цього моменту ми говорили: це книга, то стіл. (This is a book. That is a table.). Але життя — це рух, дія! Час навчитися: я читаю, ти пишеш, ми працюємо.\n\nUp until now, we've talked about what things **are** (Це книга. То стіл.). But life is movement, action! It's time to learn how to talk about what we **do**.\n\nToday you unlock your first set of Ukrainian action verbs — the **First Conjugation (-ати verbs)**. These are verbs ending in **-ати** or **-яти**, and they're everywhere in daily life: читати (to read), писати (to write), працювати (to work), гуляти (to walk), грати (to play).\n\nMastering this pattern means you can suddenly talk about what you're doing **right now**. No more frozen sentences — your Ukrainian comes alive.\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> Ukrainian verb conjugations are incredibly logical. Once you learn the First Conjugation pattern (this module), you've unlocked hundreds of verbs! They all follow the same rules, so if you know **читати → читаю**, you automatically know **працювати → працюю** and **гуляти → гуляю**. It's like getting a master key to Ukrainian action.\n\n---\n\n## Warm-up\n\nThink about your typical day. You wake up. You eat breakfast. You read. You work. You walk. You play. Every single one of these actions uses an **-ати verb** in Ukrainian.\n\n**Питання:** You read. You work. You walk. Ready to say it in Ukrainian?\n\n---\n\n## Presentation\n\n### The Pattern: -ати → -аю, -аєш, -ає...\n\nThe **First Conjugation** (sometimes called the **е-conjugation**) includes verbs whose infinitive (dictionary form) ends in **-ати** or **-яти**.\n\n> [!tip] **Grammar Secret: Aspect**\n>\n> All the verbs in this module are **imperfective** (недоконаний вид). This means they describe actions that are **ongoing, repeated, or habitual**.\n>\n> - **Я читаю** = I am reading (right now) OR I read (every day).\n>\n> In A2, you will learn «perfective» verbs for one-time completed actions (like «I finished reading»). For now, focus on these ongoing actions!\n\nTo conjugate them in the present tense, we:\n\n1. Drop the **-ти** ending\n2. Add personal endings based on **who** is doing the action\n\nLet's take **читати** (chytaty — to read) as our example:\n\n| Person   | Ukrainian    | Conjugation  | English                  |\n| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |\n| я        | я читаю      | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑju/   | I read                   |\n| ти       | ти читаєш    | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑjeʃ/  | you read (informal)      |\n| він/вона | він читає    | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑje/   | he/she reads             |\n| ми       | ми читаємо   | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑjemɔ/ | we read                  |\n| ви       | ви читаєте   | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑjete/ | you read (formal/plural) |\n| вони     | вони читають | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑjutʲ/ | they read                |\n\n**Key insight:** The stem is **чита-**. The endings tell you **who**: -ю (I), -єш (you), -є (he/she), -ємо (we), -єте (you all), -ють (they).\n\n> 🎯 **Fun Fact**\n>\n> In Ukrainian, you often **drop the pronoun** because the verb ending already tells you who's doing the action! So instead of «Я читаю», Ukrainians often just say «Читаю» — the ending **-ю** makes it clear it's «I». This makes Ukrainian sound efficient and rhythmic.\n\n### More Examples: The First Conjugation Family\n\nMost First Conjugation verbs are very regular. Let's look at two common subgroups:\n\n#### 1. Regular -ати/-яти Verbs\nThese verbs keep their stem exactly as it appears in the infinitive (minus -ти).\n\n| Infinitive | Stem    | я form   | English         |\n| ---------- | ------- | -------- | --------------- |\n| гуляти     | гуля-   | гуляю    | to walk, stroll |\n| грати      | гра-    | граю     | to play         |\n| співати    | співа-  | співаю   | to sing         |\n| думати     | дума-   | думаю    | to think        |\n| слухати    | слуха-  | слухаю   | to listen       |\n| розуміти   | розумі- | розумію  | to understand   |\n\n#### 2. The працювати Type (-ва- Dropping Rule)\n\nMany Ukrainian verbs end in **-ювати** or **-увати**. These are often new words or loanwords.\n\n**The Rule:** In the present tense, the **-ва-** syllable drops out and is replaced by **-ю-** (or -у-).\n\nThis is why **працювати** becomes **працюю** (not «працюваю»).\n\n**Memorize this pattern:**\n- Infinitive: ...-ювати\n- Present: ...-юю, -юєш, -ює\n\n| Infinitive | Stem Drop | Conjugation (Я) | English |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **працювати** | працю~~ва~~- | **працюю** | to work |\n| **танцювати** | танцю~~ва~~- | **танцюю** | to dance |\n| **подорожувати** | подорожу~~ва~~- | **подорожую** | to travel |\n| **малювати** | малю~~ва~~- | **малюю** | to paint/draw |\n\n> 🧠 **Memory Trick**\n>\n> Imagine the **-ва-** is shy. It runs away when the action happens NOW (present tense)!\n> But don't worry—it comes back in the past tense (as you'll see in M21).\n\n> [!important] **Consonant Mutation**\n> Some verbs like **писати** (to write) change their final consonant: **писати** → **пишу** (not «писаю»). Don't worry about the rules yet; just memorize the «я пишу» form for now!\n\n**Let's see them in action:**\n\n- Я **пишу** лист. (I write a letter.) — /ˈpɪʃu lɪst/\n- Ти **працюєш** тут? (Do you work here?) — /prɑˈt͡sʲujeʃ tut/\n- Вона **гуляє** в парк. (She walks to the park.) — /ɦuˈlʲɑje w pɑrk/\n- Ми **граємо**. (We play.) — /ˈɦrɑjemɔ/\n- Ви **співаєте**. (You sing.) — /spiˈwɑjete/\n- Вони **думають**. (They think.) — /ˈdumɑjutʲ/\n- Я **розумію** українську. (I understand Ukrainian.) — /rozuˈmiju ukrɑˈjinʲsʲku/\n- Ти **слухаєш** музику. (You listen to music.) — /ˈsluxɑjeʃ ˈmuzɪku/\n\n> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment**\n>\n> In the Ukrainian dub of **Harry Potter**, when Hermione says «I'm reading!», she uses the verb **читаю** (chytayu). Just one word! In English, you need two words («I'm reading»), but Ukrainian packs both the subject and the continuous action into a single conjugated verb. Economy and elegance combined.\n\n### Daily Life Verbs: -ати in Real Contexts\n\nHere's how these verbs show up in real Ukrainian life:\n\n**Ранок (Morning):**\n\n- Я **снідаю**. (I have breakfast.) — /sniˈdɑju/\n- Ти **починаєш** роботу. (You start work.) — /pɔt͡ʃɪˈnɑjeʃ rɔˈbɔtu/\n\n**День (Day):**\n\n- Вона **працює**. (She works.) — /prɑˈt͡sʲuje/\n- Ми **обідаємо**. (We have lunch.) — /ɔbiˈdɑjemɔ/\n\n**Вечір (Evening):**\n\n- Ви **вечеряєте** вдома? (Do you have dinner at home?) — /weˈt͡ʃerʲɑjete ˈwdɔmɑ/\n- Вони **відпочивають**. (They rest.) — /widpɔˈt͡ʃɪwɑjutʲ/\n\n**Вільний час (Free Time):**\n\n- Я **читаю** книгу. (I read a book.) — /t͡ʃɪˈtɑju ˈknɪɦu/\n- Ти **граєш**. (You play.) — /ˈɦrɑjeʃ/\n- Він **малює** картину. (He paints a picture.) — /mɑˈlʲuje kɑrˈtɪnu/\n- Вона **співає**. (She sings.) — /spiˈwɑje/\n\n> 🌍 **Real World**\n>\n> Walk into any Ukrainian café in Lviv and you might hear: «Ти **працюєш** сьогодні?» (Are you working today?). The barista asks this to decide if they'll pour you a strong espresso or a relaxing cappuccino. One verb — працюєш — and they know your whole vibe.\n\n---\n\n## Practice\n\n### Mini-Dialogue 1: У парку (In the park)\n\n**Setting:** Two friends meet at a park.\n\n— Привіт! Ти **читаєш**? (Hi! Are you reading?)\n— Так, **читаю** книгу. А ти? (Yes, I'm reading a book. And you?)\n— Я **чекаю** друга. Він **працює** тут. (I'm waiting for a friend. He works here.)\n— Де? (Where?)\n— Тут. Він **знає** цей парк добре! (Here. He knows this park well!)\n\n**Translation:**\n— Hi! Are you reading?\n— Yes, I'm reading a book. And you?\n— I'm waiting for a friend. He works here.\n— Where?\n— Here, in the park. He knows this park well!\n\n### Mini-Dialogue 2: Вдома (At home)\n\n**Setting:** Friends talk at home.\n\n— Ти **працюєш** сьогодні? (Do you work today?)\n— Ні, я **відпочиваю**. **Слухаю** музику. (No, I rest. I listen to music.)\n— А я **гуляю** в парк! (And I walk to the park!)\n— Я теж **люблю** парк. (I also love the park.)\n\n**Translation:**\n— Do you work today?\n— No, I rest. I listen to music.\n— And I walk to the park!\n— I also love the park.\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip**\n>\n> The verb **робити** (to do/make) is tricky! Ukrainians actually use this verb in the **Second Conjugation**. We learn that in Module 08. For now, use **читаю, граю, гуляю** — those are pure First Conjugation gold.\n\n---\n\n## Cultural Insight\n\n### Verbs and Ukrainian Soul\n\nUkrainians love action verbs. They reflect the culture's emphasis on **doing**, not just being. People in Ukraine ask: «Ти робиш?» (Do you work?), «Ти читаєш?» (Do you read?).\n\nLife is measured in verbs. What you **do** defines who you are.\n\nAnd here's the beautiful part: Ukrainian verbs carry **musicality**. Listen to the rhythm:\n\n- Я **чи-та-ю**, ти **чи-та-єш**, він **чи-та-є**...\n\nThe vowels (а, є, ю) flow like a melody. The consonants (т, в, л) give structure. This is why Ukrainian poetry and songs are so rich — the verbs themselves sing.\n\n> 🎭 **Folklore Corner**\n>\n> In Ukrainian folk songs (пісні), **First Conjugation** verbs appear constantly because they describe daily life: **співати** (to sing), **танцювати** (to dance), **гуляти** (to stroll). The famous folk song «Гуляла дівчина бережком» (A girl walked by the riverbank) uses the past tense of **гуляти** — but you now know the root! You're learning the verbs that built Ukrainian culture.\n\n---\n\n## Reading Practice: Мій день (My Day)\n\nЯ **снідаю**. (I have breakfast.)\nПотім я **працюю**. (Then I work.)\nЯ **обідаю**. (I have lunch.)\nЯ **гуляю** в парк. (I walk to the park.)\nЯ **читаю** книгу. (I read a book.)\nЯ **слухаю** музику. (I listen to music.)\nЯ **думаю**. (I think.)\n\n**Translation:**\nI have breakfast. Then I work. I have lunch. I walk to the park. I read a book. I listen to music. I think.\n\n---"
