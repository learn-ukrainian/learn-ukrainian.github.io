Test yourself and celebrate your progress!\n\n## Self-Assessment: What You've Learned\n\nBefore we begin, take a moment to reflect on your A1.2 journey. You have learned:\n\n**Grammar:**\n- ✅ **Accusative Case** — for direct objects (Я бачу книгу)\n- ✅ **Locative Case** — for locations (в Україні, на столі)\n- ✅ **Genitive Case** — for absence (кави немає, без цукру)\n- ✅ **Possessive Pronouns** — мій, твій, наш, ваш (with agreement!)\n- ✅ **Numbers 0-100** — with proper noun agreement\n\n**Vocabulary Domains:**\n- 🏙️ City navigation and directions\n- 🍕 Food and shopping\n- ☕ Café ordering and payment\n- 💰 Money and prices\n- 👨‍👩‍👧 Family and possessions\n\nThis is excellent progress! By the end of A1.2, you should be able to navigate a city, order food, and handle basic transactions — all essential survival skills in Ukraine. You've moved from simple phrases to understanding and using real grammatical structures. This is the foundation that will carry you through the rest of your Ukrainian learning journey.\n\nThink about what you could NOT do before A1.2:\n- You couldn't say \"I see the book\" (accusative)\n- You couldn't say \"in the city\" (locative)\n- You couldn't say \"there's no coffee\" (genitive)\n- You couldn't say \"my house\" with proper agreement (possessives)\n- You couldn't count and use numbers correctly with nouns\n\nNow you CAN do all of these things! That's remarkable progress. The cases you've learned form the grammatical backbone of Ukrainian. From here, you'll add more cases and refine your usage, but the core patterns are already in place.\n\n> 💡 **Thinking Trick:** This checkpoint follows the \"use it or lose it\" principle. Active practice cements knowledge; passive reading doesn't. Challenge yourself with every activity!\n\n## Presentation: Quick Reference Guide\n\n### Cases Covered in A1.2\n\n| Case | Function | Key Questions | Prepositions |\n|------|----------|---------------|--------------|\n| **Nominative** | Subject | Хто?

Let's celebrate what you've learned:\n\n- The importance of **hospitality** (гостинність) in Ukrainian culture — guests are treated like royalty!\n- **De-communization** efforts renaming streets to honor Ukrainian heroes instead of Soviet oppressors\n- Lviv's status as the **coffee capital** of Ukraine, with café culture dating back to Habsburg times\n- **Борщ** as UNESCO-recognized Ukrainian cultural heritage (not Russian, despite propaganda!)\n- The **hryvnia** currency and its historical roots in medieval Ukrainian commerce\n- Ukrainian **market culture** and the tradition of friendly bargaining\n\nThese cultural insights help you connect with Ukrainian people beyond just the language. Culture and language are inseparable! When you visit Ukraine, these cultural touchstones will help you build genuine connections with locals.\n\n**Your progress in context:** At the A1.2 level, you're developing \"tourist survival\" competence. You can handle basic daily situations independently. This doesn't sound glamorous, but it's genuinely empowering! Imagine arriving in Kyiv, navigating to your hotel, ordering lunch, and shopping at a market — all in Ukrainian. That's what A1.2 enables.\n\n**What's ahead in A1.3:** The final third of A1 will introduce the dative case (giving things TO someone), more verb forms, time expressions, and practical scenarios like making appointments and describing your daily routine. The foundation you've built here makes all of that possible!\n\n> 📜 **History Bite:** Throughout A1.2, you've encountered pieces of Ukrainian history — from the medieval origins of the hryvnia to Habsburg influence on Lviv's café culture. This historical awareness is part of what makes you not just a language learner, but a cultural ambassador. Every time you speak Ukrainian, you support a language that has survived centuries of suppression. Your learning matters. Слава Україні! Героям Слава!\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?** By completing A1.2, you now know approximately 300-400 Ukrainian words! That's more than enough for basic tourist survival. You're building a solid foundation for A1.3 and beyond. Keep practicing daily to maintain and expand your vocabulary. Every word you learn brings you closer to fluency!\n\n## Review: Comprehensive A1.2 Practice\n\nThis section tests your mastery of A1.2 content. Take your time and check your answers. If you struggle with any section, revisit the relevant module before proceeding to A1.3.\n\n**Module Review Reference:**\n- M11: Accusative I (Things) → Direct objects with inanimate nouns\n- M12: Accusative II (People) → Animate nouns (=genitive in masculine)\n- M13: Locative → Location expressions with в/у and на\n- M14: Possessives → Мій, твій, наш, ваш with full gender agreement\n- M15: Navigation → Directions vocabulary (прямо, наліво, направо)\n- M16: Genitive I → Absence with немає and без\n- M17: Numbers → 0-100 with noun agreement patterns\n- M18: Food → Shopping vocabulary and market phrases\n- M19: Café → Ordering expressions and payment phrases\n\nEach module built on the previous ones, creating an integrated skill set. If you struggled with any module, take time to review it before moving to A1.3. The cases in particular are cumulative — you'll continue using accusative, locative, and genitive throughout your Ukrainian learning, while adding dative and instrumental in future modules.\n\n## Reading Practice: Comprehensive Review 📚\n\nThis reading passage uses vocabulary and grammar from all A1.2 modules. Can you identify examples of each case?\n\n**Українською:**\n\nДобрий день! Мене звати Оксана. Я живу у Львові. Мій дім біля центру. У мене є сестра. Її звати Марія.

And a pastry.\n**Waiter:** Anything else?\n**Tourist:** No, that's all.\n\n(Later)\n\n**Tourist:** The bill, please.\n**Waiter:** 85 hryvnias.
