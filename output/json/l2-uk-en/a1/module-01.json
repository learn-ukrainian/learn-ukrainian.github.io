This module covers 18 letters you can learn quickly.\n\nThe key insight: some letters LOOK like English but make DIFFERENT sounds. We call these \"False Friends\" - they'll trick you if you're not careful!\n\n> 🔍 **Myth Buster: \"Cyrillic is Russian\"**\n>\n> Many people think Cyrillic = Russian. **Wrong!** The Cyrillic alphabet was created in the **9th century in Bulgaria** by disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius. It spread throughout the Slavic world - Russia adopted it centuries later. Today, Cyrillic is used by dozens of languages including Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Mongolian, and many others. Russian doesn't own it!\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> Ukrainian Cyrillic has **unique letters** that don't exist in Russian:\n> - **Ї** (yi) - only Ukrainian has this!\n> - **Є** (ye) - Ukrainian form\n> - **Ґ** (hard g) - restored after independence\n>\n> When you see these letters, you know it's Ukrainian, not Russian!\n\n## presentation\n\n### Group 1: True Friends (7 letters)\n\nThese letters look AND sound like their Latin equivalents:\n\n| Letter | Sound | Example |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| А а | A (as in \"father\") | мАмА |\n| Е е | E (as in \"bet\") | мЕтро |\n| І і | I (as in \"machine\") | таксІ |\n| О о | O (as in \"hot\") | фОтО |\n| К к | K | Кафе |\n| М м | M | Мама |\n| Т т | T | Тато |\n\nTrust these! They work exactly as you'd expect.\n\n**Practice reading with True Friends:**\n- МАМА (mama) - mom\n- ТАТО (tato) - dad\n- КІНО (kino) - cinema\n- КАСА (kasa) - cash register\n- АТОМ (atom) - atom\n- ТАКТ (takt) - tact\n\n> 📜 **History Bite: The Greek Connection**\n>\n> Both the Latin alphabet (which English uses) and Cyrillic come from the **Greek alphabet**. That's why letters like A, E, K, M, O, and T look the same - they share Greek ancestors! When you see these \"True Friends,\" you're seeing evidence of how alphabets evolved from ancient Greece to modern times.\n\n### Group 2: False Friends (6 letters)\n\nDANGER! These look Latin but sound completely different:\n\n| Letter | Looks like | Actually sounds like |\n|--------|------------|---------------------|\n| В в | B | V (as in \"van\") |\n| Н н | H | N (as in \"no\") |\n| Р р | P | R (rolled, as in Spanish) |\n| С с | C | S (as in \"sun\") |\n| У у | Y | U (as in \"flute\") |\n| Х х | X | KH (as in German \"Bach\") |\n\nMemorize these! They cause the most confusion for beginners.\n\n**Practice reading with False Friends:**\n- РЕСТОРАН (restoran) - restaurant (Р=R, С=S, Н=N)\n- СУПЕРМАРКЕТ (supermarket) - supermarket (С=S, У=U, Р=R)\n- ПАСПОРТ (pasport) - passport (Р=R twice!)\n- СТУДЕНТ (student) - student (С=S, У=U, Н=N)\n- ТУРИСТ (turyst) - tourist (У=U, Р=R, С=S)\n- ХОКЕЙ (khokei) - hockey (Х=KH)\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Remember the False Friends**\n>\n> Each letter looks like one thing but sounds like another:\n> - **В** looks like B → sounds like **V** (as in Violin)\n> - **Н** looks like H → sounds like **N** (as in Noon)\n> - **Р** looks like P → sounds like **R** (rolled, like Spanish)\n> - **С** looks like C → sounds like **S** (always soft)\n> - **У** looks like Y → sounds like **U** (as in flUte)\n> - **Х** looks like X → sounds like **KH** (German \"Bach\")\n>\n> Practice these daily until they become automatic!\n\n> 🎯 **Fun Fact: Why the Confusion?**\n>\n> The \"False Friends\" exist because Cyrillic and Latin alphabets evolved separately from Greek. The Greek letter **Ρ** (rho) became **R** in Latin but **Р** in Cyrillic - same origin, different evolution! Similarly, Greek **Ν** (nu) became **N** in Latin but looks like **Н** in Cyrillic.\n\n### Group 3: New But Easy (6 letters)\n\nThese don't exist in Latin but are straightforward:\n\n| Letter | Sound | Memory tip |\n|--------|-------|------------|\n| Б б | B | Belly with a belt |\n| Д д | D | Like a house |\n| З з | Z | Like the number 3 |\n| Л л | L | Like a tent |\n| П п | P | Like a doorway/portal |\n| Ф ф | F | Like a person with arms out |\n\n**Practice reading with New Letters:**\n- БАНК (bank) - bank (Б=B)\n- ДОКТОР (doktor) - doctor (Д=D)\n- ЗЕБРА (zebra) - zebra (З=Z, Б=B)\n- ЛАМПА (lampa) - lamp (Л=L, П=P)\n- ПЛАН (plan) - plan (П=P, Л=L)\n- ФУТБОЛ (futbol) - football (Ф=F, Б=B, Л=L)\n\n> 🔗 **Language Link: Don't Confuse Б and В**\n>\n> Remember: **Б** = B sound, **В** = V sound. These are completely different letters with different sounds! The В looking like Latin B is a classic \"False Friend\" trap from Module 01's Group 2.\n\n## grammar\n\n### Introduction to Nouns & Gender\n\nIn Ukrainian, every noun has a **gender**. It's not about biology (mostly) - it's about the **ending** of the word.\n\n| Gender | Ending | Example | My (M/F/N) |\n|--------|--------|---------|------------|\n| **Masculine** | Consonant | парк, брат | **мій** парк |\n| **Feminine** | -а / -я | мама, віза | **моя** мама |\n| **Neuter** | -о / -е | метро, фото | **моє** фото |\n\n> 🧠 **Pattern Recognition**\n> - If it ends in a **Consonant** (K, T, R, N...), it's usually **Masculine**.\n> - If it ends in **-A**, it's usually **Feminine**.\n> - If it ends in **-O**, it's usually **Neuter**.\n\n### \"This is...\" (Це)\n\nTo say \"This is...\", you just say **Це** (Tse). No \"is\" verb needed!\n\n> 💡 **Sight Word Alert**\n>\n> The word **Це** contains the letter Ц which you'll formally learn in Module 02. For now, just memorize **Це** (Tse) as a \"sight word\" - it's so common and useful that we introduce it early!\n\n**Examples with Це (Tse):**\n- Це парк. (Tse park) - This is a park.\n- Це мама. (Tse mama) - This is mom.\n- Це банк. (Tse bank) - This is a bank.\n- Це кафе. (Tse kafe) - This is a café.\n- Це метро. (Tse metro) - This is a metro.\n- Це ресторан. (Tse restoran) - This is a restaurant.\n- Це театр. (Tse teatr) - This is a theater.\n- Це студент. (Tse student) - This is a student.\n\n**Combine Це with \"my\" (мій/моя/моє):**\n\n> 💡 **Sight Word Alert**\n>\n> The pronouns **моя** (moya) and **моє** (moye) contain letters Я and Є which you'll learn in Module 02. For now, treat these three forms as sight words:\n> - **мій** (miy) = my (masculine) - uses only known letters!\n> - **моя** (moya) = my (feminine) - contains Я (preview)\n> - **моє** (moye) = my (neuter) - contains Є (preview)\n\n| Ukrainian | Transliteration | English | Gender |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------|--------|\n| Це мій телефон. | Tse miy telefon. | This is my phone. | Masculine |\n| Це мій доктор. | Tse miy doktor. | This is my doctor. | Masculine |\n| Це мій план. | Tse miy plan. | This is my plan. | Masculine |\n| Це моя мама. | Tse moya mama. | This is my mom. | Feminine |\n| Це моя лампа. | Tse moya lampa. | This is my lamp. | Feminine |\n| Це моя музика. | Tse moya muzyka. | This is my music. | Feminine |\n| Це моє радіо. | Tse moye radio. | This is my radio. | Neuter |\n| Це моє фото. | Tse moye foto. | This is my photo. | Neuter |\n| Це моє метро. | Tse moye metro. | This is my metro. | Neuter |\n\n## practice\n\n### Reading Strategy\n\nWhen you see a Cyrillic word:\n1. Go letter by letter\n2. Watch for False Friends (В=V, Н=N, Р=R, С=S, У=U, Х=KH)\n3. Sound it out slowly\n4. Many words are cognates - they'll sound familiar!\n\n### Try These Words\n\nSound out each word. Most are international words you'll recognize:\n\n- БАНК → B-A-N-K → bank\n- ПАРК → P-A-R-K → park\n- МЕТРО → M-E-T-R-O → metro\n- КАФЕ → K-A-F-E → café\n- СТУДЕНТ → S-T-U-D-E-N-T → student\n- ФУТБОЛ → F-U-T-B-O-L → football\n\n> 🌍 **Real World: Cognates Everywhere**\n>\n> Ukrainian (like all languages) borrows international words. When you visit Ukraine, you'll see signs you can read immediately:\n> - **БАНК** (bank)\n> - **РЕСТОРАН** (restaurant)\n> - **ГОТЕЛЬ** (hotel)\n> - **АПТЕКА** (pharmacy - from Greek \"apotheke\"!)\n>\n> About 10-15% of everyday Ukrainian words are recognizable cognates. You already know more Ukrainian than you think!\n\n## production\n\n### Reading Challenge\n\nRead these words without looking at transliteration:\n\n1. МАМА\n2. ТАТО\n3. СТУДЕНТ\n4. ФУТБОЛ\n5. МУЗИКА\n\n### False Friend Drill\n\nRemember: П = P, Р = R, В = V, Н = N, С = S, Х = KH\n\nRead these tricky words:\n- СУПЕРМАРКЕТ (supermarket)\n- РЕСТОРАН (restaurant)\n- ПАСПОРТ (passport)\n\n> 🎭 **Culture Corner: Names in Cyrillic**\n>\n> Ukrainian names follow Cyrillic spelling, which sometimes surprises English speakers:\n> - **Харків** (Kharkiv) - the Х makes a \"kh\" sound\n> - **Володимир** (Volodymyr) - В is V, not B\n> - **Степан** (Stepan) - С is S, not \"St\"\n>\n> When you see Ukrainian names transliterated to English, you're seeing someone's attempt to represent Cyrillic sounds in Latin letters!\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---"
