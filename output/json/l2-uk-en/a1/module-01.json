You are at **Бориспіль** [🔊](audio_boryspil) (Boryspil) International Airport, the main gateway to Kyiv. You grab your bag, step into the terminal, and look up. The signs are blue and yellow. Some letters look comforting and familiar: A, T, O, M. Others look vaguely recognizable but wrong, like a backwards \"N\" or a \"P\" where an \"R\" should be. And some look like alien artifacts or tridents.\n\nPanic? No. This is where your journey begins. You might think you need to memorize 33 random symbols from scratch, but that is a myth. You already know more than half of the Ukrainian alphabet. You just don't know *that you know it*.\n\nIn this module, we are not going to chant \"A, B, C.\" We are going to play the role of a codebreaker. We will treat the alphabet as a cipher that has three distinct layers: friends you can trust, tricksters that lie to you, and strangers you haven't met yet. By the end of this hour, you won't just know letters; you will be reading words like **ТАКСІ** [🔊](audio_taksi) (Taxi) and **МЕТРО** [🔊](audio_metro) (Metro) without a second thought.\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n> The Cyrillic alphabet was **NOT** invented by Russians! It was created in the late 9th century in the First Bulgarian Empire. It is named after Saint Cyril, a missionary from Byzantium, but it was likely developed by his students, particularly Saint Clement of Ohrid. They based it largely on the Greek alphabet, which explains why so many \"math symbols\" (like $\\pi$ and $\\rho$) appear as letters here. Ukraine adopted it over a thousand years ago, long before modern Russia existed.\n\n## presentation\n\n### The First Layer: True Friends\nLet's start with the easiest layer. These letters are \"True Friends\" because they are honest. They look exactly like their English counterparts (the Latin alphabet) and they make the exact same sounds. If you see **А**, you say \"Ah\". If you see **К**, you say \"K\".\n\nThere are seven of these honest letters: **А, Е, І, О, К, М, Т**.\n\nThink of the word **АТОМ** [🔊](audio_atom). In Ukrainian, it is **АТОМ**. Same letters, same meaning.\nThink of **МАМА** [🔊](audio_mama). It's **МАМА**.\nThink of **КОТ** [🔊](audio_kot). It sounds like \"cot\", but it means \"cat\" (specifically a male cat).\n\n| Letter | Sound | Example | Reading | Audio |\n|--------|-------|---------|---------|-------|\n| **А а** | /a/ as in f**a**ther | **А** | /a/ (Ah!) | [🔊](audio_a) |\n| **Е е** | /ɛ/ as in p**e**t | **Е** | /e/ (Eh?) | [🔊](audio_e) |\n| **І і** | /i/ as in mach**i**ne | **І** | /i/ (Ee) | [🔊](audio_i) |\n| **О о** | /ɔ/ as in m**o**re | **О** | /o/ (Oh) | [🔊](audio_o) |\n| **К к** | /k/ as in **k**ite | **К** | /k/ | [🔊](audio_k) |\n| **М м** | /m/ as in **m**ap | **М** | /m/ | [🔊](audio_m) |\n| **Т т** | /t/ as in **t**ent | **Т** | /t/ | [🔊](audio_t) |\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip:**\n> Ukrainian **Т** is a \"dental\" sound. Your tongue should touch your teeth, not the roof of your mouth like in English. It sounds sharper, crisper, and less \"airy\" than the English T. Try saying \"Tennis\" but touch your teeth. That's the Ukrainian **Т**.\n\n### The Second Layer: False Friends\nNow we enter the danger zone. These letters are the \"tricksters\". They look incredibly familiar—you see a \"B\", a \"P\", an \"H\", a \"C\", an \"X\", and a \"y\". But if you pronounce them like English letters, you will be speaking gibberish. These are \"False Friends\".\n\nWhy do they look like this? Because they come from Greek.\n- The letter **Р** looks like a \"P\", but it is the Greek *Rho*. It makes the **R** sound (rolled, like in Spanish or Italian).\n- The letter **Х** looks like an \"X\", but it is the Greek *Chi*. It makes the heavy **H** sound (like in \"Loch Ness\").\n\n| Letter | Looks like | Sound | Example | Reading | Audio |\n|--------|------------|-------|---------|---------|-------|\n| **В в** | B | /v/ as in **v**et | **В**іза | /vi-za/ | [🔊](audio_v) |\n| **Н н** | H | /n/ as in **n**et | **Н**і | /ni/ | [🔊](audio_n) |\n| **Р р** | P | /r/ trilled (rolled) | **Р**адіо | /ra-di-o/ | [🔊](audio_r) |\n| **С с** | C | /s/ as in **s**un (never /k/!) | **С**уп | /sup/ | [🔊](audio_s) |\n| **У у** | y | /u/ as in m**oo**n | **У**рок | /u-rok/ | [🔊](audio_u) |\n| **Х х** | X | /x/ as in lo**ch** (hard H) | **Х**аос | /kha-os/ | [🔊](audio_kh) |\n\nLet's decode a few \"False Friend\" words.\nYou see **РЕСТОРАН** [🔊](audio_restoran). Your brain says \"Pectopah\". But now you know:\n- P = R\n- C = S\n- H = N\nIt reads **RESTORAN**.\n\nYou see **МЕТРО** [🔊](audio_metro). It's not \"Metpo\". It is **METRO**.\nYou see **СУП** [🔊](audio_sup). It's not \"Cyn\". It is **SUP**.\n\n> 🔍 **Myth Buster**\n> **Myth:** \"Ukrainian is just a dialect of Russian.\"\n> **Fact:** Ukrainian is a separate East Slavic language with a distinct history. While they share an alphabet (mostly), the sounds are different. For example, the Ukrainian **Г** (H) is soft and breathy, while the Russian G is hard (like in \"Go\"). The Ukrainian **О** is always pronounced \"O\", whereas in Russian it often turns into \"A\" when unstressed. They are as different as Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n### The Third Layer: New Friends\nFinally, we meet the strangers. These letters don't look like English letters at all. They are unique shapes that you simply need to memorize. But the good news is: they usually make very simple sounds.\n\n- **Б** looks like a 6 or a b with a hat. It is **B**.\n- **Г** looks like a gallows or a hook. It is the breathy **H** (like in \"**h**ome\").\n- **Д** looks like a fortress or a table. It is **D**.\n- **З** looks like the number 3. It creates the **Z** sound.\n- **Л** looks like an upside-down V or a lambda. It is **L**.\n- **П** looks like a mathematical Pi ($\\pi$) or a doorway. It is **P**.\n- **Ф** looks like a circle with a line through it. It is **F**.\n\n| Letter | Sound | Example | Reading | Audio |\n|--------|-------|---------|---------|-------|\n| **Б б** | /b/ as in **b**oy | **Б**анк | /bank/ | [🔊](audio_b) |\n| **Д д** | /d/ as in **d**og | **Д**ім | /dim/ | [🔊](audio_d) |\n| **З з** | /z/ as in **z**oo | **З**она | /zo-na/ | [🔊](audio_z) |\n| **Л л** | /l/ as in **l**ove | **Л**ампа | /lam-pa/ | [🔊](audio_l) |\n| **П п** | /p/ as in **p**ot | **П**арк | /park/ | [🔊](audio_p) |\n| **Ф ф** | /f/ as in **f**un | **Ф**ото | /fo-to/ | [🔊](audio_f) |\n\n**Reading Practice:**\n- **БАНК** [🔊](audio_bank) (bank) — Bank\n- **ПАРК** [🔊](audio_park) (park) — Park\n- **ФОТО** [🔊](audio_foto) (fo-to) — Photo\n- **ЛАМПА** [🔊](audio_lampa) (lam-pa) — Lamp\n- **ЗОНА** [🔊](audio_zona) (zo-na) — Zone\n\n> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.**\n> The famous Ukrainian video game series **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion **Zone**. In Ukrainian, \"Zone\" is **ЗОНА** (Zona). When you see **З**, think of the **Z**ig-zag shape. The developers, GSC Game World, are based in Kyiv!\n\n### Cultural Insight: The Streetscape\nWhen you walk through a Ukrainian city like Lviv or Odesa, the streetscape is a mix of old and new. You will see **АПТЕКА** [🔊](audio_apteka) (Pharmacy - Apteka) on almost every corner. You will see **БАР** [🔊](audio_bar) (Bar) and **КАФЕ** [🔊](audio_kafe) (Kafe). You might see a sign for **НОТАРІУС** [🔊](audio_notarius) (Notary) or **АДВОКАТ** [🔊](audio_advokat) (Lawyer).\n\nReading these signs is the first step to feeling \"at home\". You stop being a foreigner who sees random shapes, and you become a reader who sees meaning. Even with just these 19 letters, you can read about 30% of the signs on the street.\n\n## practice\n\nNow, let's combine these three groups to read real international words used in Ukraine every day. Imagine you are walking down **Хрещатик** (Khreshchatyk) Street in Kyiv. You see these signs.\n\n**1. Places:**\n- **МЕТРО** [🔊](audio_metro) (Metro) — Subway\n- **КАФЕ** [🔊](audio_kafe) (Kafe) — Café\n- **БАР** [🔊](audio_bar) (Bar) — Bar\n- **ТЕАТР** [🔊](audio_teatr) (Teatr) — Theater\n- **ПАРК** [🔊](audio_park) (Park) — Park\n- **РЕСТОРАН** [🔊](audio_restoran) (Restoran) — Restaurant\n\n**2. Food:**\n- **САЛАТ** [🔊](audio_salat) (Salat) — Salad\n- **СУП** [🔊](audio_sup) (Sup) — Soup\n- **ПІЦА** [🔊](audio_pitsa) (Pitsa) — Pizza (Note: Ц is T+S, we will learn it later, but here it helps!)\n- **БАНАН** [🔊](audio_banan) (Banan) — Banana\n- **ЛИМОН** [🔊](audio_lymon) (Lymon) — Lemon\n- **КАКАО** [🔊](audio_kakao) (Kakao) — Cocoa\n- **КАВА** [🔊](audio_kava) (Kava) — Coffee\n\n**3. People:**\n- **СТУДЕНТ** [🔊](audio_student) (Student) — Student\n- **ТУРИСТ** [🔊](audio_turyst) (Turyst) — Tourist\n- **ДОКТОР** [🔊](audio_doktor) (Doktor) — Doctor\n- **АКТОР** [🔊](audio_aktor) (Aktor) — Actor\n\nLet's look at a dialogue. Two students, **Оксана** (Oksana) and **Роман** (Roman), are meeting near the metro.\n\n**Oksana:** Привіт! (Pryvit - Hi!)\n**Roman:** Привіт, Оксано!\n**Oksana:** Це метро \"Театральна\"? (Is this Metro \"Teatralna\"?)\n**Roman:** Так, це метро. (Yes, this is the metro.)\n**Oksana:** А де кафе? (And where is the café?)\n**Roman:** Кафе там. (The café is there.)\n\nNotice the structure: **Це X** (This is X). **Де X?** (Where is X?). Simple, right?\n\n## production\n\nNow you are ready to navigate a Ukrainian city map. You have the tools to decode signs.\n\nImagine you are hungry. You see a sign: **РЕСТОРАН \"ОДЕСА\"**.\n- **Р** is R.\n- **Е** is E.\n- **С** is S.\n- **Т** is T.\n- **О** is O.\n- **Р** is R.\n- **А** is A.\n- **Н** is N.\n= **RESTORAN**.\n\nNext door, you see **БАНК**.\n- **Б** is B.\n- **А** is A.\n- **Н** is N.\n- **К** is K.\n= **BANK**.\n\nYou check your **ТЕЛЕФОН** (Phone). You want to call a **ТАКСІ** (Taxi).\nYou are reading Ukrainian!\n\n---\n\n\n---"

You learned:\n1.  **True Friends** (А, К, М...) are easy.\n2.  **False Friends** (В, Н, Р...) are tricksters—watch out for them!\n3.  **New Letters** (Б, Ф, Л...) are just new shapes for familiar sounds.\n\nYou can already read words like **МЕТРО**, **ТАКСІ**, and **РЕСТОРАН**. In the next module, we will learn the \"unique\" letters that give Ukrainian its distinct sound. До побачення! (Goodbye!)\n",
