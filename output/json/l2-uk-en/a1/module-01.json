It is named after Saint Cyril, a Byzantine monk, though it was likely created by his students, particularly Saint Clement of Ohrid. Today, it is used by over 250 million people, including Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Serbians, and yes, even Mongolians! Unlocking this code opens the door to a massive part of the world.\n>\n> In Ukraine, the alphabet is a symbol of national identity. For centuries, various empires tried to ban the Ukrainian language (Ems Ukaz, Valuev Circular), but the alphabet survived. Learning it is engaging with history.\n\nWelcome to Ukrainian! The first step to unlocking the language is breaking the \"Cyrillic Code.\" It looks mysterious—like secret agent code—but here is a secret: **You already know half of it.**\n\nMany letters are exactly the same as in English. We call them the **True Friends**. You can trust them. Others are **False Friends**—they look familiar but are impostors. We will learn to spot them.\n\n### 1. The True Friends (They look and sound familiar)\n\nThese letters are your best friends. They look like English letters and make the same sound. When you see them, read them exactly as you would in English.\n\nWhy are they the same? Both the Latin alphabet (used in English) and the Cyrillic alphabet usually share a common ancestor: the Greek alphabet. These letters basically kept their shape and sound over thousands of years. It is a historical bridge connecting our languages.\n\n| Letter | Sound | Example | Note |\n|--------|-------|---------|------|\n| **А а** | /ɑ/ like f**a**ther | **Мама** (Mama) | Open your mouth wide! It's a pure \"Ah\" sound. |\n| **Е е** | /ɛ/ like p**e**t | **Метро** (Metro) | Short and crisp. Never a diphthong like \"Ay\". |\n| **І і** | /i/ like mach**i**ne | **Ідея** (Idea) | Uses a dot, just like English 'i'. |\n| **О о** | /ɔ/ like b**o**re | **Опера** (Opera) | Round your lips. It's not the 'o' in 'go'. |\n| **К к** | /k/ like s**k**ate | **Какао** (Cacao) | Hard K sound. Never soft like 'city'. |\n| **М м** | /m/ like **m**ap | **Атом** (Atom) | Just a normal M. |\n| **Т т** | /t/ like **t**ent | **Тот** (Tot) | Make it crisp. Your tongue hits your teeth. |\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip**\n>\n> Ukrainian is a **phonetic language**. This means you read exactly what you see. No hidden silent letters (like \"k\" in \"knew\") or changing vowels (like \"a\" in \"car\" vs \"cat\"). Once you learn the sound, it never changes! This makes reading Ukrainian actually *easier* than reading English once you know the symbols. You will never have to guess how to pronounce a word. If you see it, you can say it.\n\n## presentation\n\nNow, meet the **False Friends**. These are the tricksters. They *look* like English letters, but they make a completely different sound. You must rewire your brain to see them differently.\n\nThis usually happened because the Cyrillic alphabet took a Greek shape that Latin didn't use, or used it differently. For example, the Cyrillic **Р** comes from the Greek Rho (**ρ**), which makes an 'r' sound. But to an English speaker, it looks like a 'P'. You have to suppress your instinct to say 'P' and force your brain to roll that 'R'.\n\n### 2. The False Friends (Don't trust them!)\n\n| Letter | Looks like... | But sounds like... | Memory Hook |\n|--------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| **В в** | B | **V** (Very) | **V**ictory sign is V-shaped! It's a V! |\n| **Н н** | H | **N** (No) | Say **H**eck **N**o! It looks like an H but says N. |\n| **Р р** | P | **R** (Run) | **R**olling **P** (Trilled R). Think of Greek Rho. |\n| **С с** | C | **S** (See) | Like in **C**ity or **C**enter. Never a 'K' sound! |\n| **У у** | Y | **U** (Boot) | **Y**ou look cool in boots. It's the 'oo' sound. |\n| **Х х** | X | **Kh** (Loch) | Like clearing your throat (Haa!). Not 'ks'. |\n\n> 🎭 **Culture Corner**\n>\n> That last letter **Х** is very common in Ukrainian. It’s the sound in \"Kharkiv\" (Харків), the second-largest city in Ukraine, or \"Khreshchatyk\" (Хрещатик), the main street of Kyiv. It is deeper than an English \"h\". Imagine you are warming your hands in winter: \"Hhhh\". It is a \"velar fricative\"—made at the back of your throat. Unlike in English, where 'h' is just a breath, **Х** has friction.\n\n### 3. Let's Read! (International Words)\n\nNow you have enough letters to read real words. Try to read these international words aloud. Since they are \"cognates\" (born from the same root), you will understand them instantly.\n\nUkraine is a modern European country, and modern Ukrainian vocabulary is full of these internationalisms. You don't need to learn a new word for \"Taxi\" or \"Radio\". They are imports. This means your passive vocabulary is already huge before you even start studying. You just need to recognize them in their Cyrillic dress.\n\n- **Мама** (Ma-ma) — Mother. Universal word!\n- **Таксі** (Tak-si) — Taxi.\n- **Метро** (Me-tro) — Metro / Subway.\n- **Кафе** (Ka-fe) — Cafe.\n- **Спорт** (Sport) — Sport.\n- **Театр** (Te-atr) — Theater.\n- **Ресторан** (Res-to-ran) — Restaurant.\n- **Студент** (Stu-dent) — Student.\n\nDo you see? You are already reading Ukrainian! You didn't need a dictionary. You just needed to crack the cipher. This builds confidence immediately. You are not starting from zero; you are starting from a shared European vocabulary.\n\n## practice\n\nLet's practice specific confusing letters to ensure you don't fall into their traps.\n\n**В vs Б (New letter!)**\nWe haven't formally learned **Б** yet, but don't confuse it with **В**.\n- **В** (looks like B) = V sound. Example: **Віза** (Visa).\n- **Б** (looks like 6) = B sound. Example: **Банк** (Bank).\n\n**Н vs Е**\n- **Н** (looks like H) = N sound. Example: **Ні** (No).\n- **Е** (looks like E) = E sound. Example: **Ера** (Era).\n\n**Р vs П (New letter!)**\n- **Р** (looks like P) = R sound. Example: **Радіо** (Radio). The 'P' shape is actually the Greek letter Rho.\n- **П** (looks like Goal Post) = P sound. Example: **Парк** (Park).\n\n## production\n\nNow try to decipher these places in a city. Imagine you are walking down a street in Kyiv. What do the signs say?\n\n1. **Бар** (Bar) - A place for drinks.\n2. **Парк** (Park) - A place for walking.\n3. **Банк** (Bank) - A place for money.\n4. **Кафе** (Cafe) - A place for coffee.\n5. **Метро** (Metro) - Underground transport.\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> Ukrainian has 33 letters in total. You just learned or touched upon almost half of them in one lesson! The logic is simple: learn the code, unlock the language. There are no \"spelling bees\" in Ukraine because words are almost always spelled exactly how they sound.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---"

You have cracked the first layer of the Cyrillic code. You now know the True Friends and the False Friends. You have learned that Ukrainian is phonetic, meaning you read what you see. You also know that **Х** is a deep sound, and **Р** is a rolled sound. In the next module, we will learn the **Unique Letters**—the ones that look completely different, like **Ж** and **Щ**!\n",
