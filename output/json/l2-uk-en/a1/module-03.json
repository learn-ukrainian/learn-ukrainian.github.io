        "content": "## warm-up\n\nYou look around your room. In English, everything is \"it\". The table is \"it\". The lamp is \"it\".\nIn Ukrainian, objects come alive.\nThe **Стіл** (table) is a \"He\".\nThe **Книга** (book) is a \"She\".\nThe **Вікно** (window) is an \"It\".\n\nThis is the **Gender Code**. Every noun belongs to a team. If you don't know the team, you can't describe the object. You can't say \"My table\" or \"Big book\". You have to know the gender.\n\n> 💡 **Don't Panic**\n>\n> Gender has nothing to do with biology. A \"beard\" (**борода**) is feminine. A \"person\" (**людина**) is feminine, even if it's a man. It's about the **ENDING** of the word, not the meaning.\n\n## presentation\n\n### The Golden Rule of Endings\nTo know the gender, look at the last letter.\n\n#### 1. Masculine (Чоловічий рід) - He\nMost words ending in a **Consonant** are Masculine. They sound hard and solid.\n*   **Стіл** (Table) - ends in **Л**.\n*   **Дім** (House) - ends in **М**.\n*   **Парк** (Park) - ends in **К**.\n*   **Чай** (Tea) - ends in **Й** (Consonant!).\n\n#### 2. Feminine (Жіночий рід) - She\nMost words ending in **-А** or **-Я** are Feminine. They sound open and musical.\n*   **Книга** (Book) - ends in **А**.\n*   **Вода** (Water) - ends in **А**.\n*   **Сім'я** (Family) - ends in **Я**.\n*   **Кухня** (Kitchen) - ends in **Я**.\n\n#### 3. Neuter (Середній рід) - It\nMost words ending in **-О** or **-Е** are Neuter. They sound round or unfinished.\n*   **Вікно** (Window) - ends in **О**.\n*   **Місто** (City) - ends in **О**.\n*   **Море** (Sea) - ends in **Е**.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Gender | Endings | Examples | Mnemonic |\n|--------|---------|----------|----------|\n| **Masculine** | Consonant | Стіл, Банк, Йогурт | Solid Block |\n| **Feminine** | -А, -Я | Мама, Кава, Віза | Opera Singer (Ahhh!) |\n| **Neuter** | -О, -Е | Вікно, Море, Авто | The round O |\n\n> ⚠️ **The Soft Sign Trap (Ь)**\n>\n> Words ending in **Ь** can be Masculine or Feminine. You just have to memorize them.\n> *   **День** (Day) = Masculine.\n> *   **Ніч** (Night) = Feminine.\n> Don't worry about this yet. Focus on the main three rules.\n\n## narrative: The Label Maker\n\nTom moves into his Airbnb in Kyiv. He wants to learn fast. He buys a label maker (printing sticky notes). He decides to label everything.\n\nHe walks into the **КІМНАТА** [🔊](audio_kimnata) (Room).\n\"Okay, Room. Ends in A. You are a She.\"\nHe sticks a label: **ВОНА** (She).\n\nHe sees a big **СТІЛ** [🔊](audio_stil) (Table).\n\"Ends in L. Consonant. You are a He.\"\nLabel: **ВІН** (He).\n\nHe sits on the **КРІСЛО** [🔊](audio_krislo) (Armchair).\n\"Ends in O. You are It.\"\nLabel: **ВОНО** (It).\n\nHis host, Oksana, comes in. She sees the labels.\n**Oksana:** Що це? (What is this?)\n**Tom:** Це гра. (This is a game). Стіл - це він? (Table - is he?)\n**Oksana:** Так. Стіл - це він. А **ШАФА**? (And wardrobe?)\n**Tom:** Sha-fa... Ends in A. She!\n**Oksana:** Супер. А **ПІДЛОГА**? (Floor?)\n**Tom:** Pid-lo-ha... A. She!\n**Oksana:** А **ТАТО**? (Dad?)\n**Tom:** Ta-to. Ends in O... Neuter? It?\n**Oksana:** (Laughs) Ні! Тато is Dad. Dad is He!\n**Tom:** But it ends in O!\n**Oksana:** Only objects follow the rule strictly. People follow biology. **Тато** is He. **Дядько** (Uncle) is He.\n\n> 💡 **Cultural Note**\n>\n> Ukrainians rarely use \"It\" for objects. They call the car \"She\" (**Машина**), the bus \"He\" (**Автобус**), and the coffee \"He\" (**Кава** - wait, actually **Кава** is She, but many people incorrectly treat coffee as masculine in other Slavic languages. In Ukrainian: **Кава** is She. **Чай** is He.)\n\n## vocabulary: Exploration\n\nLet's explore the house using the Gender Code.\n\n**The Room (Кімната - F):**\n*   **Стілець** (Chair) - Consonant (ць counts as soft consonant). **M**.\n*   **Ліжко** (Bed) - Ends in O. **N**.\n*   **Двері** (Door) - Plural! (Like \"Doors\"). Always plural.\n*   **Стіна** (Wall) - Ends in A. **F**.\n*   **Стеля** (Ceiling) - Ends in Я. **F**.\n\n**The Kitchen (Кухня - F):**\n*   **Холодильник** (Fridge) - Consonant. **M**.\n*   **Чашка** (Cup) - Ends in A. **F**.\n*   **Склянка** (Glass) - Ends in A. **F**.\n*   **Ніж** (Knife) - Consonant. **M**.\n\n## practice\n\n**Gender Radar:**\nScan the words. Look at the last letter.\n*   **Телефон** -> N (Consonant) -> Masculine.\n*   **Лампа** -> A -> Feminine.\n*   **Радіо** -> O -> Neuter.\n\n**The \"Soft\" Problem:**\n*   **Стілець** (He)\n*   **Олівець** (Pencil - He)\n*   These end in **ЦЬ**. That is a soft consonant cluster. Still Masculine!\n\n## narrative: The Market Mission\nTom needs food. He goes to the **РИНОК** (Market). The market is loud.\n\nHe sees **ОВОЧІ** (Vegetables).\n**Seller:** Що ви хочете? (What do you want?)\n**Tom:** Я хочу... (I want...)\nHe points at a potato (**Картопля** - She).\n**Tom:** Ця картопля. (This potato).\n**Seller:** Добре.\nHe points at a tomato (**Помідор** - He).\n**Tom:** Цей помідор. (This tomato).\n\nHe makes a mistake with the apple (**Яблуко** - It).\n**Tom:** Ця яблуко.\n**Seller:** (Correcting) Це яблуко. Воно!\n**Tom:** Вибачте. Це яблуко.\n\n> 💡 **Linguistic Insight: Why Gender?**\n>\n> You might ask: \"Why make life hard? Why classify furniture?\"\n>\n> Gender adds **redundancy**. If you miss the end of a sentence, the gender agreement helps you reconstruct the meaning. It connects adjectives to nouns like a zipper.\n> *   **Великий стіл** (Big-He Table-He).\n> *   **Велика книга** (Big-She Book-She).\n>\n> It creates a rhyme and rhythm in the language. Once you hear it, English (\"The big table\", \"The big book\") sounds robotic and flat.\n\n## deep-dive: The Four Families\nGrammarians like to group nouns into 4 Declensions (Families). You don't need to memorize the numbers yet, but recognize the tribes.\n\n1.  **First Declension (The \"Alpha\" Keepers)**\n    *   Mostly Feminine nouns ending in **-A** or **-Я**.\n    *   **Мама**, **Книга**, **Земля**.\n    *   (And some Masculine nouns like **Тато**, **Суддя**).\n\n2.  **Second Declension (The Hard Core)**\n    *   Masculine (Consonant) and Neuter (-O/-E).\n    *   **Стіл**, **Вікно**, **Море**.\n    *   This is the biggest family.\n\n3.  **Third Declension (The Soft Feminines)**\n    *   Feminine nouns ending in **Ь**.\n    *   **Ніч**, **Радість** (Joy), **Любов** (Love).\n    *   They are abstract and poetic.\n\n4.  **Fourth Declension (The Baby Neuters)**\n    *   Tiny Neuter nouns ending in **-Я** / **-А** that get bigger when you touch them.\n    *   **Ім'я** (Name) -> becomes **Імені**.\n    *   **Теля** (Calf) -> becomes **Теляти**.\n\n## cultural insight: House Superstitions\nUkrainians treat their houses with respect and a bit of magic.\n\n1.  **Стіл (The Table):** You must never sit on the table. It is for food given by God. Sitting on it is disrespectful and brings poverty. Also, never wipe crumbs off the table with your hand—use a cloth, or you will have no money!\n2.  **Погріг (Threshold - before the Door):** Do not shake hands across the threshold (**поріг**). It separates the safe \"inside\" from the dangerous \"outside\". Step inside first, then shake hands.\n3.  **Сіль (Salt - F):** If you spill salt, you will have a fight (**сварка**). To fix it, throw a pinch of salt over your left shoulder and laugh.\n4.  **Свистіти (To whistle):** Do not whistle inside the house! \"**Не свисти - грошей не буде**\" (Don't whistle - there will be no money).\n\n---\n\n\n---"

You now see the world not as \"things\", but as \"Hes\", \"Shes\", and \"Its\".\n\n*   **He** (Він): Shoulders, tough endings (Consonants). **Стіл**, **Дім**.\n*   **She** (Вона): Singing endings (-A, -Я). **Мама**, **Школа**.\n*   **It** (Воно): Round endings (-O, -E). **Вікно**, **Море**.\n\nYou also labeled your entire house. You know that a **Стілець** is a \"he\" and a **Шафа** is a \"she\".\nIn the next module, we will learn how to point at these things and say: \"**Це** моя книга\" (This is my book).\n\n# Vocabulary\n\n| Word | IPA | English | POS | Gender | Note |\n|------|-----|---------|-----|--------|------|\n| стіл | /stil/ | table | noun | m | [🔊](audio_stil) |\n| книга | /ˈknɪɦɑ/ | book | noun | f | [🔊](audio_knyha) |\n| вікно | /vikˈnɔ/ | window | noun | n | [🔊](audio_vikno) |\n| двері | /ˈdvɛri/ | door | noun | pl | [🔊](audio_dveri) |\n| кімната | /kimˈnɑtɑ/ | room | noun | f | [🔊](audio_kimnata) |\n| дім | /dim/ | house (home) | noun | m | [🔊](audio_dim) |\n| місто | /ˈmistɔ/ | city | noun | n | [🔊](audio_misto) |\n| село | /sɛˈlɔ/ | village | noun | n | [🔊](audio_selo) |\n| річка | /ˈritʃkɑ/ | river | noun | f | [🔊](audio_richka) |\n| море | /ˈmɔrɛ/ | sea | noun | n | [🔊](audio_more) |\n| хліб | /xlib/ | bread | noun | m | [🔊](audio_khlib) |\n| вода | /vɔˈdɑ/ | water | noun | f | [🔊](audio_voda) |\n| молоко | /mɔlɔˈkɔ/ | milk | noun | n | [🔊](audio_moloko) |\n| чай | /tʃɑj/ | tea | noun | m | [🔊](audio_chaj) |\n| сік | /sik/ | juice | noun | m | [🔊](audio_sik) |\n| м'ясо | /ˈmjɑsɔ/ | meat | noun | n | [🔊](audio_myaso) |\n| риба | /ˈrɪbɑ/ | fish | noun | f | [🔊](audio_ryba) |\n| овочі | /ˈɔvɔtʃi/ | vegetables | noun | pl | [🔊](audio_ovochi) |\n| фрукти | /ˈfruktɪ/ | fruits | noun | pl | [🔊](audio_frukty) |\n| яблуко | /ˈjɑblukɔ/ | apple | noun | n | [🔊](audio_yabluko) |\n| апельсин | /ɑpɛlʲˈsɪn/ | orange | noun | m | [🔊](audio_apelsyn) |\n| картопля | /kɑrˈtɔplʲɑ/ | potato | noun | f | [🔊](audio_kartoplya) |\n| помідор | /pɔmiˈdɔr/ | tomato | noun | m | [🔊](audio_pomidor) |\n| огірок | /ɔɦiˈrɔk/ | cucumber | noun | m | [🔊](audio_ohirok) |\n| цибуля | /t͡sɪˈbulʲɑ/ | onion | noun | f | [🔊](audio_tsybulya) |\n| стілець | /stiˈlɛt͡sʲ/ | chair | noun | m | [🔊](audio_stilets) |\n| крісло | /ˈkrislɔ/ | armchair | noun | n | [🔊](audio_krislo) |\n| шафа | /ˈʃɑfɑ/ | wardrobe | noun | f | [🔊](audio_shafa) |\n| диван | /dɪˈvɑn/ | sofa | noun | m | [🔊](audio_dyvan) |\n| ліжко | /ˈliʒkɔ/ | bed | noun | n | [🔊](audio_lizhko) |\n| підлога | /pidˈlɔɦɑ/ | floor | noun | f | [🔊](audio_pidloha) |\n| стеля | /ˈstɛlʲɑ/ | ceiling | noun | f | [🔊](audio_stelya) |\n| стіна | /stiˈnɑ/ | wall | noun | f | [🔊](audio_stina) |\n| магазин | /mɑɦɑˈzɪn/ | shop | noun | m | [🔊](audio_mahazyn) |\n| школа | /ˈʃkɔlɑ/ | school | noun | f | [🔊](audio_shkola) |\n| університет | /univɛrsɪˈtɛt/ | university | noun | m | [🔊](audio_universytet) |\n",
