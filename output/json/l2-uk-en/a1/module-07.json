You can state facts, but you cannot ask for information. You cannot connect.\n\nTo truly interact, you need two keys:\n1.  **The Question:** To invite someone else into the conversation.\n2.  **The Negation:** To define boundaries and correct misunderstandings.\n\nToday, we hand you these keys. We will turn you from a narrator into an interviewer. You will learn to ask \"Who?\" \"Where?\" and \"Why?\"—the three favorite words of every Ukrainian grandmother!\n\n\n### The Polite Stranger vs. The Friend\n\nImagine two scenes.\n**Scene 1:** You meet a stranger. You want to ask if they know English.\n- **You:** \"Чи ви знаєте англійську?\" (Do you know English?) -> *Polite, clear, structured.*\n\n**Scene 2:** You are with a friend. You are shocked they don't know a meme.\n- **You:** \"Ти не знаєш?!\" (You don't know?!) -> *Emotional, direct, intonation-driven.*\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know? The \"Thinking\" Sound**\n> When English speakers think, they say \"Ummm...\"\n> When Ukrainian speakers think, they often say \"Еммм...\" (Emmm...) or stretch the last vowel of the previous word.\n> \"Я думаюююю...\" (I am thinking...)\n\n### The Melody of a Question\n\nUkrainian is very musical. The difference between a statement and a question is often just the melody.\n- **Statement:** The voice goes down at the end, like a heavy stone dropping. $\\searrow$\n- **Question:** The voice jumps UP on the most important word, then hangs in the air. $\\nearrow$\n\n> 🔗 **Language Link: The Missing \"Do\"**\n> In English, you need \"helpers\" like \"Do\" or \"Does\" or \"Is\".\n> - \"Do you read?\"\n> - \"Is he here?\"\n> Ukrainian has NO helpers. The specific verb and the context do all the heavy lifting.\n> - \"Ти читаєш?\" (You read?)\n> - \"Він тут?\" (He here?)\n> It makes learning easier—fewer words to juggle!\n\n\n## presentation\n\n### Key 1: The Yes/No Question (Так чи Ні?)\n\nAs we hinted in the last module, the easiest way to ask a question is **Intonation**.\n- **Ти знаєш.** (You know.) $\\searrow$ (Falling tone)\n- **Ти знаєш?** (Do you know?) $\\nearrow$ (Rising tone like a surprise)\n\nBut sometimes, for polite emphasis or clarity, we use the particle **Чи** (Chy) at the start. **Чи** is like a flag that says \"Hey! A question is coming!\" It functions a bit like \"Do\" or \"Is\" in English questions.\n\n**Pattern:** **Чи** + [Sentence]?\n- **Чи** ти знаєш? (Do you know?)\n- **Чи** це правда? (Is this true?)\n- **Чи** він тут? (Is he here?)\n\n**When to use Чи:**\n- In formal writing (almost always).\n- When you want to be very clear.\n- When offering an alternative: \"Кава **чи** чай?\" (Coffee **or** tea?) -> Yes, \"Чи\" also means \"Or\"!\n\n### Key 2: The Question Words (The \"W\" Words)\n\nTo get specific information, you need these power words. Note that most of them start with **K** or **Щ** or **Д**.\n\n| Word | IPA | English | Example | Translation | Audio |\n|------|-----|---------|---------|-------------|-------|\n| **Хто?** | /xtɔ/ | Who? | **Хто** це? | Who is this? | [🔊](audio_khto) |\n| **Що?** | /ʃtʃɔ/ | What? | **Що** ти робиш? | What are you doing? | [🔊](audio_shcho) |\n| **Де?** | /dɛ/ | Where? | **Де** ти? | Where are you? | [🔊](audio_de) |\n| **Куди?** | /kuˈdɪ/ | Where to? | **Куди** ти йдеш? | Where are you going? | [🔊](audio_kudy) |\n| **Коли?** | /kɔˈlɪ/ | When? | **Коли** обід? | When is lunch? | [🔊](audio_koly) |\n| **Чому?** | /tʃɔˈmu/ | Why? | **Чому** ти тут? | Why are you here? | [🔊](audio_chomu) |\n| **Як?** | /jɑk/ | How? | **Як** справи? | How are things? | [🔊](audio_yak) |\n| **Скільки?** | /ˈsʲkʲilʲkɪ/ | How much? | **Скільки** коштує? | How much does it cost? | [🔊](audio_skilky) |\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Де vs. Куди**\n> English uses \"Where\" for both location and direction. Ukrainian is precise!\n> - **Де** = Location (Static). \"Де ти?\" (At what place are you?)\n> - **Куди** = Direction (Motion). \"Куди ми йдемо?\" (To what place are we going?)\n> Memorize: \"**Де** is here, **Куди** is to go.\"\n\n### Key 3: The Power of \"No\" (Negation)\n\nNegation in Ukrainian is beautifully simple. You just put **Не** (Ne) immediately BEFORE the word you want to negate.\n\n**Pattern:** Subject + **не** + Verb.\n- Я **не** знаю. (I do not know.)\n- Він **не** читає. (He is not reading.)\n- Це **не** цікаво. (This is not interesting.)\n\n**The Double Negative Rule:**\nIn English, logic suggests two negatives make a positive (\"I don't know nothing\" = I know something).\nIn Ukrainian, logic takes a backseat to **emphatic concord**. If the meaning is negative, every part of the sentence must agree to be negative!\n\n**You must match the negative pronoun with the negative particle `не`.**\n- **Ніколи** (Never) $\\rightarrow$ Я **ніколи не** читаю. (I [never] [not] read.)\n- **Ніхто** (Nobody) $\\rightarrow$ **Ніхто не** знає. ([Nobody] [not] knows.)\n- **Ніде** (Nowhere) $\\rightarrow$ Він **ніде не** працює. (He works [nowhere] [not].)\n- **Нічого** (Nothing) $\\rightarrow$ Я **нічого не** бачу. (I see [nothing] [not].)\n\n\n> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: The \"No\" of Steel**\n> In many action movies dubbed in Ukrainian, the dramatic \"NOOOOO!\" is translated simply as \"**НІ!**\" But when a hero refuses a command, like \"I will not do it!\", they say \"**Я не буду!**\" (I will not!). The particle **не** is the shield that stops the action.\n\n> 🎭 **Culture Corner: The Direct \"No\"**\n> Ukrainians can be quite direct. If you ask \"Do you want coffee?\" and the answer is \"Ні\" (No), it's not rude. It's just efficient.\n> However, \"Ні, дякую\" (No, thank you) is always better!\n\n\n##\n---\n\n\n---"

(Why are you not working?)\n\n**Drill 2: The Honest Friend**\nAnswer using frequency words.\n- Q: Ти читаєш? (Do you read?)\n- A: Так, я **часто** читаю. (Yes, I often read.)\n\n- Q: Ти співаєш? (Do you sing?)\n- A: Ні, я **ніколи не** співаю. (No, I [never] [not] sing.) -- *Remember the double negative!*\n\n- Q: Ти гуляєш? (Do you walk?)\n- A: Іноді. (Sometimes.)\n\n- Q: Ти знаєш? (Do you know?)\n- A: Звичайно! (Of course!)\n\n> 🔗 **Language Link: \"Of Course\"**\n> The word **Звичайно** comes from **Звичка** (Habit). So strictly speaking, it means \"Usually\" or \"As per habit,\" but it is used exactly like \"Of course\" or \"Certainly.\"\n\n\n## production\n\nLook at the room you are in. Ask 3 questions about it in your head (or aloud).\n1. **Де** мій телефон? (Where is my phone?)\n2. **Чому** тут холодно? (Why is it cold here?)\n3. **Хто** там? (Who is there?)\n\nNow turn these statements into negative sentences:\n1. Я снідаю. $\\rightarrow$ Я **не** снідаю.\n2. Ми розуміємо. $\\rightarrow$ Ми **не** розуміємо.\n3.
