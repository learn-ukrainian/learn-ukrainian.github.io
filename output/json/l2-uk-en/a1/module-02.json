After this module, you'll be able to read ANY Ukrainian word!\n\nToday's letters include some special ones that make Ukrainian unique - letters that don't exist in Russian or other Slavic languages.\n\n> 🔍 **Myth Buster: \"Ukrainian is a Russian Dialect\"**\n>\n> Some people claim Ukrainian is just \"a dialect of Russian.\" This is **completely false** - and politically charged misinformation. Ukrainian and Russian are separate languages that split from a common ancestor about 1,000 years ago. They have:\n> - Different sounds and phonology\n> - Different grammar rules\n> - Different vocabulary (only ~60% lexical similarity)\n> - **Different letters** - Ukrainian has Ї, Є, Ґ that Russian lacks!\n>\n> Would you call Spanish a \"dialect of Italian\"? Same logic applies here.\n\n## presentation\n\n### Group 4: Unique Consonants (7 letters)\n\nThese consonants have sounds that English speakers need to practice:\n\n| Letter | Sound | English approximation |\n|--------|-------|----------------------|\n| Г г | H | \"H\" in \"hello\" (soft, breathy) |\n| Ґ ґ | G | \"G\" in \"go\" (hard g - rare in Ukrainian!) |\n| Ж ж | ZH | \"S\" in \"pleasure\" or \"vision\" |\n| Ш ш | SH | \"SH\" in \"ship\" |\n| Щ щ | SHCH | \"SH+CH\" combined (fresh cheese) |\n| Ч ч | CH | \"CH\" in \"church\" |\n| Ц ц | TS | \"TS\" in \"cats\" |\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> The letter **Ґ** (hard G) has a fascinating history! It was **banned** during the Soviet era as part of Russification policies. After Ukrainian independence in 1991, it was officially restored. Today, words with Ґ like **ґанок** (porch) and **ґудзик** (button) are markers of authentic Ukrainian spelling. When you see Ґ, you're seeing a letter that survived cultural suppression!\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Г vs Ґ**\n>\n> - **Г** = soft H sound (like \"hello\") - VERY common\n> - **Ґ** = hard G sound (like \"go\") - rare, mostly in borrowed words\n>\n> Russian has only Г (pronounced as G), so Russians often mispronounce Ukrainian Г. This is a telltale accent marker!\n\n### Group 5: Iotated Vowels (4 letters)\n\nThese vowels start with a \"Y\" sound (like \"yes\"):\n\n| Letter | Sound | Example |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| Є є | YE | \"YE\" in \"yes\" |\n| Ї ї | YI | \"YEE\" (yi as in \"yeast\") |\n| Ю ю | YU | \"YU\" in \"universe\" |\n| Я я | YA | \"YA\" in \"yard\" |\n\n> 📜 **History Bite: The Iotated Vowels**\n>\n> The term \"iotated\" comes from the Greek letter **iota** (ι). These vowels combine a \"y\" glide (called \"iot\") with a regular vowel:\n> - Є = Й + Е (y + e)\n> - Ї = Й + І (y + i)\n> - Ю = Й + У (y + u)\n> - Я = Й + А (y + a)\n>\n> After a consonant, they soften that consonant instead of adding \"y\". This is key to Ukrainian pronunciation!\n\n> 🎯 **Fun Fact: Ї - Ukraine's Signature Letter**\n>\n> The letter **Ї** exists ONLY in Ukrainian - no other language in the world uses it! It's so iconic that there's a famous Ukrainian cultural magazine called \"Ї\" (Yi). When you see this letter, you know 100% you're reading Ukrainian, not Russian, Bulgarian, or any other Cyrillic language.\n\n### Group 6: Special Letters (4 letters)\n\n| Letter | Sound | Function |\n|--------|-------|----------|\n| И и | Y (short) | Like \"i\" in \"bit\" (not \"ee\"!) |\n| Й й | Y (consonant) | Like \"y\" in \"yes\" |\n| Ь ь | — (silent) | Softens the previous consonant |\n| ' | — (pause) | Apostrophe - separates sounds |\n\n> 🔗 **Language Link: И vs І vs Ї**\n>\n> Ukrainian has THREE \"i\" sounds - confusing at first, but logical:\n> - **І** = \"ee\" as in \"m**ee**t\" (True Friend from Module 01)\n> - **И** = short \"i\" as in \"b**i**t\" (no English equivalent - between \"i\" and \"u\")\n> - **Ї** = \"yee\" as in \"**yea**st\" (y + ee combined)\n>\n> Listen carefully to native speakers - these are distinct sounds!\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know? The Silent Letter**\n>\n> The **soft sign (Ь)** makes no sound by itself! Instead, it **changes** the consonant before it:\n> - **кон** (horse) → **кінь** (different horse form, softer ending)\n> - **мат** (checkmate) → **мать** (mother - archaic)\n>\n> Think of Ь as an instruction: \"soften what came before me!\"\n\n## practice\n\n### The Cursive Trap\n\n**WARNING:** Ukrainian cursive (italic) letters can look VERY different from print!\n\n| Print | Cursive | Trap Level |\n|-------|---------|------------|\n| т | m-like | ⚠️ HIGH - looks like Latin \"m\"! |\n| п | n-like | ⚠️ HIGH - looks like Latin \"n\"! |\n| д | g-like | ⚠️ HIGH - looks like Latin \"g\"! |\n| и | u-like | ⚠️ MEDIUM - looks like Latin \"u\" |\n| л | hook | ⚠️ MEDIUM - connected differently |\n| г | ∂-like | ⚠️ MEDIUM - loops differently |\n\n> 🎭 **Culture Corner: Handwriting in Ukraine**\n>\n> Ukrainians learn cursive writing in first grade and use it throughout life. Official documents, signatures, and handwritten notes are almost always in cursive. If you ever receive a handwritten letter from Ukraine, remember: that \"m\" is probably **т**, that \"n\" is probably **п**, and that \"g\" is probably **д**!\n\n### Reading Practice\n\nNow try reading words with ALL 33 letters:\n\n**Basic words:**\n- УКРАЇНА → U-K-R-A-YI-N-A → Ukraine\n- КИЇВ → K-Y-YI-V → Kyiv\n- МОВА → M-O-V-A → language\n- ДЯКУЮ → D-YA-K-U-YU → thank you\n\n**Phrases:**\n- ДОБРЕ → D-O-B-R-E → good/okay\n- БУДЬ ЛАСКА → BUD' LAS-KA → please\n- ДО ПОБАЧЕННЯ → DO PO-BA-CHEN-NYA → goodbye\n\n> 🌍 **Real World: Your First Ukrainian Phrases**\n>\n> You just learned some of the most useful Ukrainian phrases:\n> - **Привіт!** (pryvit) - Hi!\n> - **Дякую!** (dyakuyu) - Thank you!\n> - **Будь ласка** (bud' laska) - Please / You're welcome\n> - **Так** (tak) - Yes\n> - **Ні** (ni) - No\n>\n> With just these words, you can already be polite in Ukraine!\n\n## production\n\n### Complete Alphabet Challenge\n\nYou now know all 33 letters! Here's the full Ukrainian alphabet:\n\n**А Б В Г Ґ Д Е Є Ж З И І Ї Й К Л М Н О П Р С Т У Ф Х Ц Ч Ш Щ Ь Ю Я**\n\nRead these words that use letters from both modules:\n\n1. ШКОЛА (shkola) - school\n2. ЛЮДИНА (lyudyna) - person\n3. ЇЖА (yizha) - food\n4. ЩАСТЯ (shchastya) - happiness\n5. ЦЕНТР (tsentr) - center\n\n### Alphabet Song Order\n\nThe Ukrainian alphabet has a specific order (like ABC in English). Practice saying:\n\nА, Б, В, Г, Ґ, Д, Е, Є, Ж, З, И, І, Ї, Й, К, Л, М, Н, О, П, Р, С, Т, У, Ф, Х, Ц, Ч, Ш, Щ, Ь, Ю, Я\n\n> 🎯 **Fun Fact: No Ъ in Ukrainian!**\n>\n> Russian has a \"hard sign\" (Ъ), but Ukrainian doesn't! Ukrainian uses an apostrophe (') instead to separate sounds. This is another easy way to tell Ukrainian from Russian text - if you see Ъ, it's not Ukrainian!\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---"

The letter **Ї** (unique to Ukrainian) is pronounced as:\n   - [ ] Single [i] sound like \"meet\"\n   - [x] Double sound [yi] like \"yeast\"\n   - [ ] Short [i] like \"bit\"\n   - [ ] Silent\n   > Ї = iotated vowel, always two sounds: Y + I\n\n2. What distinguishes **Г** from **Ґ**?\n   - [ ] Г is hard G, Ґ is soft H\n   - [x] Г is soft H, Ґ is hard G\n   - [ ] They are the same sound\n   - [ ] Г is voiced, Ґ is unvoiced\n   > Г = soft H (hello), Ґ = hard G (go) - Ґ was banned during Soviet era\n\n3. The soft sign **Ь** functions to:\n   - [ ] Add a vowel sound\n   - [ ] Mark stress position\n   - [x] Soften the preceding consonant\n   - [ ] Separate syllables\n   > Ь makes no sound - it modifies the consonant before it\n\n4.

The letter **И** sounds like:\n   - [ ] Long \"ee\" as in \"meet\"\n   - [x] Short \"i\" as in \"bit\" (between i and u)\n   - [ ] \"Y\" as in \"yes\"\n   - [ ] \"A\" as in \"cat\"\n   > И is unique - between English \"i\" and \"u\", not found in English\n\n6. How is **Щ** pronounced?\n   - [ ] [sh] like \"ship\"\n   - [ ] [ch] like \"church\"\n   - [x] [shch] like \"fresh cheese\"\n   - [ ] [sk] like \"sky\"\n   > Щ = Ш + Ч combined = \"shch\"\n\n7. What is the apostrophe (') used for in Ukrainian?\n   - [ ] To indicate stress\n   - [ ] To mark possessives\n   - [x] To separate sounds (similar to Russian Ъ)\n   - [ ] To soften consonants\n   > Ukrainian uses ' instead of Russian's hard sign Ъ\n\n8. In cursive, Ukrainian **т** looks like:\n   - [x] Latin \"m\"\n   - [ ] Latin \"n\"\n   - [ ] Latin \"g\"\n   - [ ] Latin \"u\"\n   > Cursive trap: т→m, п→n, д→g - major reading challenge!\n\n9. Why is **Ґ** called a \"survivor letter\"?\n   - [ ] It's the oldest Cyrillic letter\n   - [x] It was banned during Soviet Russification and restored after independence\n   - [ ] It survived from Greek alphabet\n   - [ ] It's rarely used\n   > Ґ was banned 1933-1991 as part of suppressing Ukrainian identity\n\n10. The letter **Й** is classified as:\n    - [x] A consonant (Y-sound in \"yes\")\n    - [ ] A vowel\n    - [ ] A soft sign\n    - [ ] An iotated letter\n    > Й = consonantal Y, used at word endings (край) and in diphthongs\n\n## true-false: Alphabet Rules\n\n> Determine if each statement about Ukrainian letters is true or false.\n\n- [x] The letter Ї exists only in Ukrainian, not in Russian or other Slavic languages.\n   > Correct! Ї is Ukraine's unique signature letter.\n\n- [ ] The letters Г and Ґ are pronounced the same way.\n   > Incorrect. Г = soft H (hello), Ґ = hard G (go).\n\n- [x] Iotated vowels (Є, Ї, Ю, Я) all start with a Y-glide sound.\n   > Correct! They combine Y + vowel: ye, yi, yu, ya.\n\n- [ ] The soft sign (Ь) is pronounced as a short vowel.\n   > Incorrect. Ь is silent - it softens the preceding consonant.\n\n- [x] Ukrainian uses an apostrophe (') instead of the Russian hard sign (Ъ).\n   > Correct! This is one way to identify Ukrainian vs Russian text.\n\n- [ ] The letter И sounds exactly like English \"ee\" in \"meet.\"\n   > Incorrect. И is a short sound between \"i\" and \"u\" - unique to Ukrainian.\n\n- [x] In cursive writing, Ukrainian т looks like Latin m.\n   > Correct! This is a major \"trap\" for learners reading handwriting.\n\n- [x] The letter Ґ was restored to Ukrainian after independence in 1991.\n   > Correct! It was banned during Soviet Russification (1933-1991).\n\n- [ ] The letters Ш and Щ are pronounced identically.\n   > Incorrect. Ш = [sh], Щ = [shch] (two sounds combined).\n\n- [x] Ukrainian has 33 letters in its alphabet.\n   > Correct! More than English (26) but fewer than Russian (33).\n\n---\n\n# Vocabulary\n\n| Word | IPA | English | POS | Gender | Note |\n|------|-----|---------|-----|--------|------|\n| буква | /ˈbukvɑ/ | letter (of alphabet) | noun | f | Б, У - uses new letters |\n| слово | /ˈslɔvɔ/ | word | noun | n | Basic vocabulary |\n| алфавіт | /ɑlfɑˈvʲit/ | alphabet | noun | m | Also: абетка (traditional) |\n| мова | /ˈmɔvɑ/ | language | noun | f | Українська мова = Ukrainian language |\n| українська | /ukrɑˈjinʲsʲkɑ/ | Ukrainian (adj) | adj | f | Uses Ї! |\n| англійська | /ɑnˈɦlʲijsʲkɑ/ | English (adj) | adj | f | Г = H sound |\n| так | /tɑk/ | yes | particle | - | Essential word |\n| ні | /nʲi/ | no | particle | - | Essential word |\n| добре | /ˈdɔbrɛ/ | good, okay | adv | - | Common response |\n| дякую | /ˈdʲakuju/ | thank you | verb | - | Я, Ю = iotated |\n| будь ласка | /budʲ ˈlɑskɑ/ | please | phrase | - | Ь = soft sign |\n| привіт | /prɪˈvʲit/ | hi, hello | interj | - | Informal greeting |\n| до побачення | /dɔ pɔˈbɑtʃɛnʲːɑ/ | goodbye | phrase | - | Ч = CH |\n| вибачте | /vɪˈbɑtʃtɛ/ | excuse me, sorry | verb | - | Ч = CH |\n| прошу | /ˈprɔʃu/ | please/you're welcome | verb | - | Ш = SH |\n| ласкаво просимо | /ˈlɑskɑvɔ ˈprɔsɪmɔ/ | welcome | phrase | - | Formal welcome |\n| що | /ʃtʃɔ/ | what | pron | - | Щ = SHCH |\n| як | /jɑk/ | how | adv | - | Я = YA |\n| де | /dɛ/ | where | adv | - | Simple question word |\n| хто | /xtɔ/ | who | pron | - | Х = KH |\n| чай | /tʃɑj/ | tea | noun | m | Ч = CH, Й = Y |\n| кава | /ˈkɑvɑ/ | coffee | noun | f | Basic word |\n| борщ | /bɔrʃtʃ/ | borscht | noun | m | Щ = SHCH |\n| школа | /ˈʃkɔlɑ/ | school | noun | f | Ш = SH |\n| центр | /t͡sɛntr/ | center | noun | m | Ц = TS |\n| місто | /ˈmʲistɔ/ | city | noun | n | Basic word |\n| сім'я | /sʲiˈmjuɑ/ | family | noun | f | ' = apostrophe, Я = YA |\n| ім'я | /iˈmjuɑ/ | name | noun | n | ' = apostrophe, Я = YA |\n| жінка | /ˈʒinkɑ/ | woman | noun | f | Ж = ZH |\n| чоловік | /tʃɔlɔˈvʲik/ | man/husband | noun | m | Ч = CH |\n---\n\n# Letter Groups Summary\n\n## Module 01 Letters (18)\nА Е І О К М Т (True Friends)\nВ Н Р С У Х (False Friends)\nБ Д З Л П Ф (New Letters)\n\n## Module 02 Letters (15)\nГ Ґ Ж Ш Щ Ч Ц (Unique Consonants)\nЄ Ї Ю Я (Iotated Vowels)\nИ Й Ь (Special Letters)\n\n## Complete Ukrainian Alphabet (33)\nА Б В Г Ґ Д Е Є Ж З И І Ї Й К Л М Н О П Р С Т У Ф Х Ц Ч Ш Щ Ь Ю Я\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\n> 💡 **What You Learned Today**\n>\n> - All 33 letters of the Ukrainian alphabet - you can now read anything!\n> - **Unique consonants:** Г (h), Ґ (g), Ж (zh), Ш (sh), Щ (shch), Ч (ch), Ц (ts)\n> - **Iotated vowels:** Є (ye), Ї (yi), Ю (yu), Я (ya) - they start with \"y\"\n> - **Special letters:** И (short i), Й (y consonant), Ь (softens consonants)\n> - The letter **Ї** exists ONLY in Ukrainian!\n> - Cursive letters can look very different - watch out!\n> - Your first Ukrainian phrases: Дякую!
