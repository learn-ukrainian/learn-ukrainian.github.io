After this module, you'll be able to read ANY Ukrainian word!\n\nToday's letters include some special ones that make Ukrainian unique - letters that don't exist in Russian or other Slavic languages.\n\n> 🔍 **Myth Buster: \"Ukrainian is a Russian Dialect\"**\n>\n> Some people claim Ukrainian is just \"a dialect of Russian.\" This is **completely false** - and politically charged misinformation. Ukrainian and Russian are separate languages that split from a common ancestor about 1,000 years ago. They have:\n> - Different sounds and phonology\n> - Different grammar rules\n> - Different vocabulary (only ~60% lexical similarity)\n> - **Different letters** - Ukrainian has Ї, Є, Ґ that Russian lacks!\n>\n> Would you call Spanish a \"dialect of Italian\"? Same logic applies here.\n\n## presentation\n\n### Group 4: Unique Consonants (7 letters)\n\nThese consonants have sounds that English speakers need to practice:\n\n| Letter | Sound | English approximation |\n|--------|-------|----------------------|\n| Г г | H | \"H\" in \"hello\" (soft, breathy) |\n| Ґ ґ | G | \"G\" in \"go\" (hard g - rare in Ukrainian!) |\n| Ж ж | ZH | \"S\" in \"pleasure\" or \"vision\" |\n| Ш ш | SH | \"SH\" in \"ship\" |\n| Щ щ | SHCH | \"SH+CH\" combined (fresh cheese) |\n| Ч ч | CH | \"CH\" in \"church\" |\n| Ц ц | TS | \"TS\" in \"cats\" |\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know?**\n>\n> The letter **Ґ** (hard G) has a fascinating history! It was **banned** during the Soviet era as part of Russification policies. After Ukrainian independence in 1991, it was officially restored. Today, words with Ґ like **ґанок** (porch) and **ґудзик** (button) are markers of authentic Ukrainian spelling. When you see Ґ, you're seeing a letter that survived cultural suppression!\n\n> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Г vs Ґ**\n>\n> - **Г** = soft H sound (like \"hello\") - VERY common\n> - **Ґ** = hard G sound (like \"go\") - rare, mostly in borrowed words\n>\n> Russian has only Г (pronounced as G), so Russians often mispronounce Ukrainian Г. This is a telltale accent marker!\n\n### Group 5: Iotated Vowels (4 letters)\n\nThese vowels start with a \"Y\" sound (like \"yes\"):\n\n| Letter | Sound | Example |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| Є є | YE | \"YE\" in \"yes\" |\n| Ї ї | YI | \"YEE\" (yi as in \"yeast\") |\n| Ю ю | YU | \"YU\" in \"universe\" |\n| Я я | YA | \"YA\" in \"yard\" |\n\n> 📜 **History Bite: The Iotated Vowels**\n>\n> The term \"iotated\" comes from the Greek letter **iota** (ι). These vowels combine a \"y\" glide (called \"iot\") with a regular vowel:\n> - Є = Й + Е (y + e)\n> - Ї = Й + І (y + i)\n> - Ю = Й + У (y + u)\n> - Я = Й + А (y + a)\n>\n> After a consonant, they soften that consonant instead of adding \"y\". This is key to Ukrainian pronunciation!\n\n> 🎯 **Fun Fact: Ї - Ukraine's Signature Letter**\n>\n> The letter **Ї** exists ONLY in Ukrainian - no other language in the world uses it! It's so iconic that there's a famous Ukrainian cultural magazine called \"Ї\" (Yi). When you see this letter, you know 100% you're reading Ukrainian, not Russian, Bulgarian, or any other Cyrillic language.\n\n> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: \"I am Groot\"**\n>\n> In Ukrainian, Groot would say: **Я є Ґрут** (Ya ye Grut). Notice the letters you just learned:\n> - **Я** (ya) - iotated vowel for \"I\"\n> - **є** (ye) - iotated vowel meaning \"am/is\"\n> - **Ґ** (g) - Ukraine's rare hard G!\n>\n> Three new letters in one iconic phrase. You're already reading real Ukrainian!\n\n### Group 6: Special Letters (4 letters)\n\n| Letter | Sound | Function |\n|--------|-------|----------|\n| И и | Y (short) | Like \"i\" in \"bit\" (not \"ee\"!) |\n| Й й | Y (consonant) | Like \"y\" in \"yes\" |\n| Ь ь | — (silent) | Softens the previous consonant |\n| ' | — (pause) | Apostrophe - separates sounds |\n\n> 🔗 **Language Link: И vs І vs Ї**\n>\n> Ukrainian has THREE \"i\" sounds - confusing at first, but logical:\n> - **І** = \"ee\" as in \"m**ee**t\" (True Friend from Module 01)\n> - **И** = short \"i\" as in \"b**i**t\" (no English equivalent - between \"i\" and \"u\")\n> - **Ї** = \"yee\" as in \"**yea**st\" (y + ee combined)\n>\n> Listen carefully to native speakers - these are distinct sounds!\n\n> 💡 **Did You Know? The Silent Letter**\n>\n> The **soft sign (Ь)** makes no sound by itself! Instead, it **changes** the consonant before it:\n> - **кон** (horse) → **кінь** (different horse form, softer ending)\n> - **мат** (checkmate) → **мать** (mother - archaic)\n>\n> Think of Ь as an instruction: \"soften what came before me!\"\n\n## practice\n\n### The Cursive Trap\n\n**WARNING:** Ukrainian cursive (italic) letters can look VERY different from print!\n\n| Print | Cursive | Trap Level |\n|-------|---------|------------|\n| т | m-like | ⚠️ HIGH - looks like Latin \"m\"! |\n| п | n-like | ⚠️ HIGH - looks like Latin \"n\"! |\n| д | g-like | ⚠️ HIGH - looks like Latin \"g\"! |\n| и | u-like | ⚠️ MEDIUM - looks like Latin \"u\" |\n| л | hook | ⚠️ MEDIUM - connected differently |\n| г | ∂-like | ⚠️ MEDIUM - loops differently |\n\n> 🎭 **Culture Corner: Handwriting in Ukraine**\n>\n> Ukrainians learn cursive writing in first grade and use it throughout life. Official documents, signatures, and handwritten notes are almost always in cursive. If you ever receive a handwritten letter from Ukraine, remember: that \"m\" is probably **т**, that \"n\" is probably **п**, and that \"g\" is probably **д**!\n\n### Reading Practice\n\nNow try reading words with ALL 33 letters:\n\n**Basic words:**\n- УКРАЇНА → U-K-R-A-YI-N-A → Ukraine\n- КИЇВ → K-Y-YI-V → Kyiv\n- МОВА → M-O-V-A → language\n- ДЯКУЮ → D-YA-K-U-YU → thank you\n\n**Phrases:**\n- ДОБРЕ → D-O-B-R-E → good/okay\n- БУДЬ ЛАСКА → BUD' LAS-KA → please\n- ДО ПОБАЧЕННЯ → DO PO-BA-CHEN-NYA → goodbye\n\n> 🌍 **Real World: Your First Ukrainian Phrases**\n>\n> You just learned some of the most useful Ukrainian phrases:\n> - **Привіт!** (pryvit) - Hi!\n> - **Дякую!** (dyakuyu) - Thank you!\n> - **Будь ласка** (bud' laska) - Please / You're welcome\n> - **Так** (tak) - Yes\n> - **Ні** (ni) - No\n>\n> With just these words, you can already be polite in Ukraine!\n\n## production\n\n### Complete Alphabet Challenge\n\nYou now know all 33 letters! Here's the full Ukrainian alphabet:\n\n**А Б В Г Ґ Д Е Є Ж З И І Ї Й К Л М Н О П Р С Т У Ф Х Ц Ч Ш Щ Ь Ю Я**\n\nRead these words that use letters from both modules:\n\n1. ШКОЛА (shkola) - school\n2. ЛЮДИНА (lyudyna) - person\n3. ЇЖА (yizha) - food\n4. ЩАСТЯ (shchastya) - happiness\n5. ЦЕНТР (tsentr) - center\n\n### Alphabet Song Order\n\nThe Ukrainian alphabet has a specific order (like ABC in English). Practice saying:\n\nА, Б, В, Г, Ґ, Д, Е, Є, Ж, З, И, І, Ї, Й, К, Л, М, Н, О, П, Р, С, Т, У, Ф, Х, Ц, Ч, Ш, Щ, Ь, Ю, Я\n\n> 🎯 **Fun Fact: No Ъ in Ukrainian!**\n>\n> Russian has a \"hard sign\" (Ъ), but Ukrainian doesn't! Ukrainian uses an apostrophe (') instead to separate sounds. This is another easy way to tell Ukrainian from Russian text - if you see Ъ, it's not Ukrainian!\n\n---\n\n## Euphony Preview: І vs Й\n\n### Why Ukrainian Sounds So Melodic\n\nUkrainian has built-in rules that make words flow together smoothly. One simple rule you can use right now:\n\n**The word \"and\" has two forms: і and й**\n\n**Rule:** Use **й** after vowels, **і** after consonants.\n\n| Context | Correct | Why |\n|---------|---------|-----|\n| мама **й** тато | \"й\" after vowel \"а\" flows smoothly |\n| хліб **і** сіль | \"і\" after consonant \"б\" is easier to say |\n| кава **й** чай | \"й\" after vowel \"а\" |\n| борщ **і** каша | \"і\" after consonant \"щ\" |\n\n> 💡 **Memory Trick**\n>\n> Think of **й** as the \"lazy\" version of **і**. After a vowel, your mouth is already open, so it takes the shortcut \"й\". After a consonant, you need the full \"і\" to open up the sound again.\n\n**More euphony rules** (у/в, з/із/зі) will be covered in later modules when you learn the grammar they require.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n---"

The letter **Ї** (unique to Ukrainian) is pronounced as:\n   - [ ] Single [i] sound like \"meet\"\n   - [x] Double sound [yi] like \"yeast\"\n   - [ ] Short [i] like \"bit\"\n   - [ ] Silent\n   > Ї = iotated vowel, always two sounds: Y + I\n\n2. What distinguishes **Г** from **Ґ**?\n   - [ ] Г is hard G, Ґ is soft H\n   - [x] Г is soft H, Ґ is hard G\n   - [ ] They are the same sound\n   - [ ] Г is voiced, Ґ is unvoiced\n   > Г = soft H (hello), Ґ = hard G (go) - Ґ was banned during Soviet era\n\n3. The soft sign **Ь** functions to:\n   - [ ] Add a vowel sound\n   - [ ] Mark stress position\n   - [x] Soften the preceding consonant\n   - [ ] Separate syllables\n   > Ь makes no sound - it modifies the consonant before it\n\n4. Which statement about iotated vowels is correct?\n   - [ ] They are pronounced as single sounds\n   - [x] They combine a Y-glide with a vowel (Є=ye, Ю=yu, Я=ya)\n   - [ ] They only exist in Russian\n   - [ ] They are silent in some positions\n   > Iotated = \"iota\" (Greek) = Y-sound + vowel\n\n5. The letter **И** sounds like:\n   - [ ] Long \"ee\" as in \"meet\"\n   - [x] Short \"i\" as in \"bit\" (between i and u)\n   - [ ] \"Y\" as in \"yes\"\n   - [ ] \"A\" as in \"cat\"\n   > И is unique - between English \"i\" and \"u\", not found in English\n\n6. How is **Щ** pronounced?\n   - [ ] [sh] like \"ship\"\n   - [ ] [ch] like \"church\"\n   - [x] [shch] like \"fresh cheese\"\n   - [ ] [sk] like \"sky\"\n   > Щ = Ш + Ч combined = \"shch\"\n\n7. What is the apostrophe (') used for in Ukrainian?\n   - [ ] To indicate stress\n   - [ ] To mark possessives\n   - [x] To separate sounds (similar to Russian Ъ)\n   - [ ] To soften consonants\n   > Ukrainian uses ' instead of Russian's hard sign Ъ\n\n8. In cursive, Ukrainian **т** looks like:\n   - [x] Latin \"m\"\n   - [ ] Latin \"n\"\n   - [ ] Latin \"g\"\n   - [ ] Latin \"u\"\n   > Cursive trap: т→m, п→n, д→g - major reading challenge!\n\n9. Why is **Ґ** called a \"survivor letter\"?\n   - [ ] It's the oldest Cyrillic letter\n   - [x] It was banned during Soviet Russification and restored after independence\n   - [ ] It survived from Greek alphabet\n   - [ ] It's rarely used\n   > Ґ was banned 1933-1991 as part of suppressing Ukrainian identity\n\n10. The letter **Й** is classified as:\n    - [x] A consonant (Y-sound in \"yes\")\n    - [ ] A vowel\n    - [ ] A soft sign\n    - [ ] An iotated letter\n    > Й = consonantal Y, used at word endings (край) and in diphthongs\n\n11. How many letters are in the Ukrainian alphabet?\n    - [ ] 26 (same as English)\n    - [ ] 30\n    - [x] 33\n    - [ ] 36\n    > Ukrainian has 33 letters - you learned all of them in Modules 1-2!\n\n12. The letter **Ш** sounds like:\n    - [x] [sh] like \"ship\"\n    - [ ] [s] like \"sun\"\n    - [ ] [ch] like \"church\"\n    - [ ] [zh] like \"vision\"\n    > Ш = [sh], always a consistent \"sh\" sound\n\n## true-false: Alphabet Rules\n\n> Determine if each statement about Ukrainian letters is true or false.\n\n- [x] The letter Ї exists only in Ukrainian, not in Russian or other Slavic languages.\n   > Correct! Ї is Ukraine's unique signature letter.\n\n- [ ] The letters Г and Ґ are pronounced the same way.\n   > Incorrect. Г = soft H (hello), Ґ = hard G (go).\n\n- [x] Iotated vowels (Є, Ї, Ю, Я) all start with a Y-glide sound.\n   > Correct! They combine Y + vowel: ye, yi, yu, ya.\n\n- [ ] The soft sign (Ь) is pronounced as a short vowel.\n   > Incorrect. Ь is silent - it softens the preceding consonant.\n\n- [x] Ukrainian uses an apostrophe (') instead of the Russian hard sign (Ъ).\n   > Correct! This is one way to identify Ukrainian vs Russian text.\n\n- [ ] The letter И sounds exactly like English \"ee\" in \"meet.\"\n   > Incorrect. И is a short sound between \"i\" and \"u\" - unique to Ukrainian.\n\n- [x] In cursive writing, Ukrainian т looks like Latin m.\n   > Correct! This is a major \"trap\" for learners reading handwriting.\n\n- [x] The letter Ґ was restored to Ukrainian after independence in 1991.\n   > Correct! It was banned during Soviet Russification (1933-1991).\n\n- [ ] The letters Ш and Щ are pronounced identically.\n   > Incorrect. Ш = [sh], Щ = [shch] (two sounds combined).\n\n- [x] Ukrainian has 33 letters in its alphabet.\n   > Correct! More than English (26) but same as Russian (33).\n\n- [x] The letter Ц makes a \"ts\" sound like in \"cats.\"\n   > Correct! Ц = [ts], a single letter for a common sound combination.\n\n- [ ] The letter Й is a vowel in Ukrainian.\n   > Incorrect. Й is a consonant (the \"y\" sound in \"yes\"), not a vowel.\n\n## fill-in: Euphony - І vs Й\n\n> Choose the correct form: **і** or **й**. Remember: **й** after vowels, **і** after consonants!\n\n1. мама ___ тато (mom and dad)\n   > [!answer] й\n   > [!options] і | й\n\n2. хліб ___ сіль (bread and salt)\n   > [!answer] і\n   > [!options] і | й\n\n3. кава ___ чай (coffee and tea)\n   > [!answer] й\n   > [!options] і | й\n\n4. борщ ___ вареники (borscht and varenyky)\n   > [!answer] і\n   > [!options] і | й\n\n5. сестра ___ брат (sister and brother)\n   > [!answer] й\n   > [!options] і | й\n\n6.
