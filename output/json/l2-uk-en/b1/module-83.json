(Is it done?)\n\n### Process Focus = Imperfective\n\nWhen you care about the **activity itself** or **how time was spent**, use imperfective:\n\n**Signals of process focus:**\n- Duration (how long)\n- Activity description\n- \"What were you doing?\"\n- No concern for completion\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Я **читав** книгу весь вечір. - I was reading a book all evening.\n- Вона **писала** статтю три дні. - She was writing the article for three days.\n- Ми **будували** дім два роки. - We were building a house for two years.\n- Він **вчив** українську в університеті. - He was studying Ukrainian at university.\n- Що ти **робив** учора? - What were you doing yesterday?\n\n> **⚠️ Ambiguity Note**\n>\n> \"Я **читав** книгу весь вечір\" emphasizes duration (process). But if you finished the book that evening, you could also say \"Я **прочитав** книгу за вечір\" (I read the book in one evening). Both are grammatically correct - the choice depends on whether you want to emphasize the **process** or the **result**. Duration markers make imperfective *more natural*, but don't make perfective wrong.\n\n### The Same Event, Different Perspective\n\n| Imperfective (process) | Perfective (result) |\n|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Я **читав** цю книгу. | Я **прочитав** цю книгу. |\n| I was reading this book. | I read (finished) this book. |\n| Вона **готувала** вечерю. | Вона **приготувала** вечерю. |\n| She was cooking dinner. | She cooked dinner (it's ready). |\n| Він **писав** листа. | Він **написав** листа. |\n| He was writing a letter. | He wrote the letter (done). |\n\n> **Notice:** The same real-world situation can be described with either aspect.

    "rawMarkdown": "---\nmodule: 83\ntitle: \"Aspect in Past: Result vs Process\"\nsubtitle: \"What Happened vs What Was Happening\"\nlevel: B1\nphase: B1.1\nduration: 45\ntransliteration: none\ntags: [aspect, grammar, verbs, past-tense, result, process]\nobjectives:\n  - Distinguish result-focused from process-focused actions\n  - Use perfective when the result matters\n  - Use imperfective when the process matters\n  - Master aspect selection in various contexts\ngrammar:\n  - Perfective past for results\n  - Imperfective past for process/duration\n  - Context-based aspect selection\n---\n\n# Lesson Content\n\n## warm-up\n\n### Two Different Questions\n\nConsider these two questions:\n\n- Що ти **робив** учора? - What were you doing yesterday?\n- Що ти **зробив** учора? - What did you accomplish yesterday?\n\nBoth ask about yesterday. But they ask about **different things**:\n- First: the process, how you spent time\n- Second: the result, what you completed\n\n> This is the heart of Ukrainian aspect: **perspective on the action**.\n\n## presentation\n\n### Result Focus = Perfective\n\nWhen you care about the **outcome** or **completion**, use perfective:\n\n**Signals of result focus:**\n- Achievement or accomplishment\n- \"Did you finish?\"\n- \"What's done?\"\n- Concrete output\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Я **прочитав** книгу. - I read the book (finished it).\n- Вона **написала** статтю. - She wrote the article (completed it).\n- Ми **побудували** дім. - We built a house (it's done).\n- Він **вивчив** українську. - He learned Ukrainian (mastered it).\n- Ти **зробив** домашнє завдання? - Did you do your homework? (Is it done?)\n\n### Process Focus = Imperfective\n\nWhen you care about the **activity itself** or **how time was spent**, use imperfective:\n\n**Signals of process focus:**\n- Duration (how long)\n- Activity description\n- \"What were you doing?\"\n- No concern for completion\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Я **читав** книгу весь вечір. - I was reading a book all evening.\n- Вона **писала** статтю три дні. - She was writing the article for three days.\n- Ми **будували** дім два роки. - We were building a house for two years.\n- Він **вчив** українську в університеті. - He was studying Ukrainian at university.\n- Що ти **робив** учора? - What were you doing yesterday?\n\n> **⚠️ Ambiguity Note**\n>\n> \"Я **читав** книгу весь вечір\" emphasizes duration (process). But if you finished the book that evening, you could also say \"Я **прочитав** книгу за вечір\" (I read the book in one evening). Both are grammatically correct - the choice depends on whether you want to emphasize the **process** or the **result**. Duration markers make imperfective *more natural*, but don't make perfective wrong.\n\n### The Same Event, Different Perspective\n\n| Imperfective (process) | Perfective (result) |\n|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Я **читав** цю книгу. | Я **прочитав** цю книгу. |\n| I was reading this book. | I read (finished) this book. |\n| Вона **готувала** вечерю. | Вона **приготувала** вечерю. |\n| She was cooking dinner. | She cooked dinner (it's ready). |\n| Він **писав** листа. | Він **написав** листа. |\n| He was writing a letter. | He wrote the letter (done). |\n\n> **Notice:** The same real-world situation can be described with either aspect. The choice depends on what you want to emphasize.\n\n---\n\n> **🔑 KEY RULE: DURATION vs COMPLETION TIME**\n>\n> | Question | Aspect | Time Expression | Example |\n> |----------|--------|-----------------|---------|\n> | \"How long?\" | **Imperfective** | весь день, годинами | Я **читав** книгу тиждень. |\n> | \"In how much time?\" | **Perfective** | за годину, за день | Я **прочитав** книгу за тиждень. |\n>\n> **Listen for triggers:**\n> - Duration words (весь, цілий, довго) → **imperfective**\n> - \"за + time\" (completion) → **perfective**\n\n---\n\n### Duration Words Demand Imperfective\n\nExpressions of duration require imperfective:\n\n- **весь день** - all day\n- **цілий тиждень** - the whole week\n- **три години** - for three hours\n- **довго** - for a long time\n- **весь час** - all the time\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Ми **чекали** на тебе годину. - We were waiting for you for an hour.\n- Він **працював** там п'ять років. - He worked there for five years.\n- Вона **спала** весь день. - She slept all day.\n- Я **думав** про це довго. - I was thinking about it for a long time.\n\n**NOT:** ~~Ми зачекали на тебе годину.~~ (Perfective doesn't combine with duration)\n\n### Result Words Demand Perfective\n\nExpressions of result or completion require perfective:\n\n- **вже** - already\n- **нарешті** - finally\n- **за годину** - in an hour (completion time)\n- **швидко** - quickly (completed quickly)\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Він **вже приїхав**. - He has already arrived.\n- Нарешті ми **закінчили**! - Finally we finished!\n- Вона **зробила** це за годину. - She did it in an hour.\n- Я швидко **поснідав**. - I quickly had breakfast.\n\n### Questions: Process vs Result\n\n**Asking about process (imperfective):**\n\n- Що ти робив? - What were you doing?\n- Чим ти займався? - What were you occupied with?\n- Як ти проводив час? - How were you spending time?\n- Довго ти чекав? - Were you waiting long?\n\n**Asking about result (perfective):**\n\n- Що ти зробив? - What did you do/accomplish?\n- Ти зробив це? - Did you do it?\n- Ти вже поїв? - Have you eaten already?\n- Все зрозумів? - Did you understand everything?\n\n### Interrupted Actions = Imperfective\n\nWhen an action was **interrupted** (not completed), use imperfective:\n\n- Я **читав** книгу, коли він прийшов. - I was reading a book when he came.\n- Вона **готувала** вечерю, але не закінчила. - She was cooking dinner but didn't finish.\n- Ми **дивилися** фільм, коли зникло світло. - We were watching a movie when the power went out.\n\nThe action was in progress but something interrupted it.\n\n### Completed Despite Duration = Perfective\n\nIf an action was completed, use perfective even with time:\n\n- Я **прочитав** книгу **за тиждень**. - I read the book in a week.\n- Вона **написала** статтю **за два дні**. - She wrote the article in two days.\n\n**\"За + time\"** means \"within that time, completed.\" Different from duration!\n\nCompare:\n- Я читав книгу тиждень. (Process: spent a week reading)\n- Я прочитав книгу за тиждень. (Result: finished it within a week)\n\n## practice\n\n### Choose: Result or Process?\n\n1. Я ___ (дивився/подивився) цей фільм три рази.\n   > [!answer] **дивився** (three times = process)\n2. Ти вже ___ (снідав/поснідав)?\n   > [!answer] **поснідав** (already = result)\n3.
