TRANSLATION TASK - 413 Ukrainian Words
===============================================================================

HOW TO TRANSLATE:
-----------------
1. Copy all words from: all-remaining-words.txt
2. Paste to Gemini (or ChatGPT) with this prompt:

---BEGIN PROMPT---

Translate these Ukrainian words to English. Return ONLY a JSON object with format:
{
  "ukrainian_word": "english_translation"
}

Rules:
- Provide the most common English translation
- For adjectives, translate as adjective (e.g., "новий" → "new")
- For verbs in infinitive, translate with "to" (e.g., "говорити" → "to speak")
- For nouns, provide the basic English equivalent
- For proper nouns (names, places), transliterate or provide English equivalent
- For diminutives, include "little" or "dear" in translation
- Skip words that are clearly fragments or corrupted (just omit from JSON)
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text

Words:

Return the JSON object now.

---END PROMPT---

3. Save the JSON response to: data/translations/all-translations.json
4. Tell Claude: "done"

NOTES:
------
- Many words are fragments - Gemini will skip them (expected)
- We expect ~100-150 valid translations out of 413 words
- Claude will apply the translations automatically when you say "done"
