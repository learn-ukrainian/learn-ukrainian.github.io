| Experience Quality | 10/10 | Exceptional hook, vivid imagery, compelling narrative throughout. The opening paragraph draws you in immediately. |
| Coherence | 10/10 | Perfect logical flow from graffiti introduction → analysis → historical context → linguistic significance → methodology → modern relevance. |
