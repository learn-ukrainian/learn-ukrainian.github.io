subtitle: "High Formal Register: Language of Documents"
version: "1.0"
phase: "C1.5 Folk Culture & Arts" # Wait, Plan says M139 is in High Formal Register section?
# The plan structure might have shifted. M121-145 is "Folk Culture & Arts" in the TEMPLATE description, but in the PLAN text I just read, M139 is "High Formal Register".
# Let's check the Phase name from the Plan if possible.
# Actually, looking at the Plan output:
# "Module 139: High Formal Register"
# It seems "High Formal Register" IS the topic.
# But "Phase" usually refers to the block name.
# Let's look at the surrounding modules in the plan or headers.
# I'll check the header above M139 in the plan.
