# Module Richness Guidelines

## Philosophy

> **The curriculum is the goal. Vibe is just a tool.**

Modules should be **rich, engaging, and comprehensive**. One curriculum module may generate multiple Vibe lessons - this is expected and encouraged. The curriculum should never be constrained by platform limitations.

## Module Length & Depth

### Minimum Content Requirements

| Level | Min Duration | Min Vocabulary | Min Activities | Depth Expectation |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| A1 | 30 min | 15 words | 3 | Foundation building |
| A2 | 35 min | 20 words | 4 | Skill expansion |
| B1 | 40 min | 25 words | 4 | Complex integration |
| B2 | 45 min | 30 words | 5 | Professional depth |
| C1 | 50 min | 30 words | 5 | Near-native richness |
| Tracks | 45-60 min | 35 words | 5 | Domain expertise |

### Content Depth Indicators

A "rich" module includes:

- [ ] **Theory section** with clear explanations
- [ ] **Multiple examples** (not just 1-2)
- [ ] **Authentic materials** (real texts, media)
- [ ] **Cultural context** where relevant
- [ ] **Common mistakes** section (Типові помилки)
- [ ] **Practice activities** (varied types)
- [ ] **Production tasks** (speaking/writing)
- [ ] **Self-assessment** checklist
- [ ] **Pronunciation guidance** (B2+ grammar modules)

## Module-to-Vibe Mapping

### One Module → Multiple Vibe Lessons

A single curriculum module can generate:

| Vibe Lesson | Content |
|-------------|---------|
| Lesson 1 | Theory + Basic practice |
| Lesson 2 | Vocabulary deep dive |
| Lesson 3 | Interactive activities |
| Lesson 4 | Production + Review |

### When to Split: Decision Criteria

**Split a module into multiple Vibe lessons when ANY of these apply:**

| Trigger | Threshold | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Duration | > 45 min estimated | Learner fatigue, session limits |
| Vocabulary | > 25 words | Memory overload |
| Activities | > 5 activities | Too much in one session |
| Grammar points | > 2 major concepts | Cognitive overload |
| Content sections | > 4 distinct topics | Natural breakpoints exist |
| Engagement boxes | > 6 boxes | Information density |

**How to decide:**

1. **After writing module** - Review against thresholds above
2. **Natural breakpoints** - Look for clear topic transitions
3. **Learner testing** - If completion rates drop, consider splitting
4. **Platform feedback** - Vibe may have session length recommendations

**Splitting approach:**

```
Module 01 (too long) → Split into:
├── Lesson 01a: Theory + first activity
├── Lesson 01b: Vocabulary + practice activities
└── Lesson 01c: Production + review
```

**For now:** Start with 1:1 mapping. Mark modules that feel "heavy" with a note:
```yaml
split_candidate: true
split_reason: "25+ vocabulary words, 6 activities"
```

We'll revisit after testing with real learners.

### Example Breakdown

**Module 201: Ancient Ukraine**

Could become:
1. **Vibe Lesson 201a:** Pre-history vocabulary + map activities
2. **Vibe Lesson 201b:** Scythian culture reading + comprehension
3. **Vibe Lesson 201c:** Founding of Kyiv narrative + listening
4. **Vibe Lesson 201d:** Production - describe ancient Ukraine
5. **Vibe Lesson 201e:** Review quiz + cultural discussion

### Generator Adaptation

The generator (`scripts/generate.ts`) should:
1. Accept module markdown as input
2. Optionally split into multiple Vibe lessons
3. Maintain cross-references between lessons
4. Track which lessons belong to which module

## Engagement Techniques

### Variety in Activities

Each module should include **at least 3 different activity types**:

| Activity Type | Engagement Level | Best For |
|---------------|------------------|----------|
| Match-up | Medium | Vocabulary, associations |
| Quiz (MCQ) | Medium | Comprehension check |
| Gap-fill | Medium-High | Grammar practice |
| Sorting/Grouping | High | Categorization |
| Ordering/Sequencing | High | Narrative, process |
| Dialogue completion | High | Functional language |
| Translation (short) | Medium | Accuracy practice |
| Listening comprehension | High | Audio skills |
| Image labeling | High | Visual learners |
| Video comprehension | Very High | Engagement, culture |

### Gamification Elements

Consider including:
- **Points/scores** for activities
- **Streaks** for consecutive correct answers
- **Badges** for module completion
- **Leaderboards** (if platform supports)
- **Easter eggs** - hidden cultural content

### Story & Narrative

Where possible, create:
- **Recurring characters** across modules
- **Story arcs** that develop over levels
- **Real-world scenarios** learners can relate to
- **Cultural narratives** that teach while engaging

## Interesting Context & Engagement Boxes

### Required: Every Module Must Include At Least One

Modules should include **contextual boxes** that make learning memorable and engaging:

| Box Type | Icon | Purpose | Example |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| Did You Know? | 💡 | Fascinating facts | "Ukrainian has 7 cases, but English lost them 500 years ago!" |
| Myth Buster | 🔍 | Correct misconceptions | "Cyrillic isn't Russian - it was created in Bulgaria!" |
| Pro Tip | ⚡ | Practical advice | "Ukrainians rarely use the formal 'Ви' with family" |
| Culture Corner | 🎭 | Traditions, customs | "Why Ukrainians say 'на Україні' is controversial" |
| History Bite | 📜 | Historical context | "The letter Ї exists only in Ukrainian - no other Slavic language has it" |
| Fun Fact | 🎯 | Memorable tidbits | "The word 'Козак' (Cossack) means 'free man'" |
| Language Link | 🔗 | Connections to English | "'Borsch' entered English from Ukrainian, not Russian" |
| Real World | 🌍 | Modern relevance | "These words appear daily in Ukrainian news" |

### Box Format in Markdown

```markdown
> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> The Cyrillic alphabet was NOT invented by Russians! It was created in the
> 9th century in Bulgaria by followers of Saints Cyril and Methodius. Russia
> adopted it centuries later. Ukrainian Cyrillic has unique letters (Ї, Є, Ґ)
> that don't exist in Russian!
```

### Placement Guidelines

- **At least 1-2 boxes** per module section
- Place after introducing new concepts (reinforcement)
- Use to break up dense grammar explanations
- Connect abstract grammar to real cultural context
- Make learners want to share what they learned!

### Box Content Principles

1. **Surprising** - Challenge assumptions
2. **Memorable** - Stick in the mind
3. **Accurate** - Verified facts only
4. **Relevant** - Connected to the lesson content
5. **Shareable** - "I didn't know that!" factor

### Examples by Level

**A1 (Alphabet/Basics):**
- Origin of Cyrillic alphabet
- Ukrainian unique letters
- Why Ukrainian sounds different from Russian
- Famous Ukrainian words in English (steppe, borsch)

**A2 (Grammar Expansion):**
- How Ukrainian cases compare to Latin/German
- Why aspect is "the soul of Slavic languages"
- Historical reasons for grammatical features

**B1-B2 (Intermediate):**
- Language politics and identity
- Regional dialects and their history
- Ukrainian literary tradition
- Famous polyglots who learned Ukrainian

**C1+ (Advanced):**
- Linguistic research about Ukrainian
- Evolution of Ukrainian over centuries
- Influence of other languages
- Debates in modern Ukrainian linguistics

## Pronunciation Guidance (B2+ Grammar Modules)

### When Required

Grammar modules at B2+ level that introduce new grammatical forms must include pronunciation guidance:

| Grammar Type | Pronunciation Elements |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Passive forms | -ий vs -о endings, stress patterns |
| Participles | Stress shifts, consonant changes |
| Complex verb forms | Aspect-related stress |
| Formal registers | Intonation patterns |

### Required Components

1. **IPA transcriptions** for key examples
2. **Stress pattern tables** showing where stress falls
3. **Minimal pairs** for forms that sound similar (e.g., написаний vs написано)
4. **Intonation contours** for sentence-level pronunciation

### Format Example

```markdown
# Вимова [grammatical form]

## Наголос

| Форма | IPA | Наголос |
|-------|-----|---------|
| написа́ний | /nɐpɪˈsɑnɪj/ | на -са- |
| напи́сано | /nɐpɪˈsɑno/ | на -са- |

## Мінімальні пари

| Форма 1 | IPA | Форма 2 | IPA |
|---------|-----|---------|-----|
| -ий | /ɪj/ | -о | /o/ |

## Інтонація

| Контекст | Інтонаційний контур |
|----------|---------------------|
| Нейтральний | → ↘ |
| Офіційний | ↗ ↘ |
```

### Rationale

At B2+, learners need to:
- **Produce** accurate pronunciation, not just recognize
- **Distinguish** similar forms by sound
- **Match** register through intonation
- **Self-correct** using stress patterns

---

## Cultural Content

### Every Module Should Include

At minimum one of:
- **Cultural note** - Customs, traditions, history
- **Language tip** - Pragmatics, usage nuance
- **Fun fact** - Interesting cultural tidbit
- **Comparison** - Ukrainian vs English approach
- **Current relevance** - Modern Ukraine connection

### Cultural Sensitivity

- **Verify facts** with native speakers
- **Acknowledge diversity** within Ukraine
- **Avoid stereotypes** - Present nuanced view
- **Current events awareness** - Consider ongoing situation
- **Multiple perspectives** - Where relevant
