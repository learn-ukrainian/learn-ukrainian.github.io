## Qualitative Evaluation

### 1. Linguistic Accuracy & Naturalness

- **Ukrainian Text:** The Ukrainian prose is natural, sophisticated (B2+ level), and historically accurate. Use of terms like «спудей», «митрополит», «панегірик» is contextually appropriate.
- **Immersion:** The module maintains high immersion. English is used only for instructions and sidecar metadata.
- **Pedagogical Clarity:** Grammar and vocabulary are used in a way that is challenging yet accessible for B2 learners.

### 2. Historical & Cultural Accuracy

- **Mohyla's Lineage:** Correctly identifies his Moldovan origins and ties to the Potocki/Wiśniowiecki families.
- **Kyiv-Mohyla Academy:** accurately describes the merger of the Lavra and Brotherhood schools in 1632.
- **Restoration:** Correctly attributes the restoration of St. Sophia and the excavation of the Desiatynna church to Mohyla.
- **Decolonization:** Effectively refutes the "Latinization" myth, framing Mohyla's strategy as an intellectual defense of Orthodoxy.

### 3. Activity Quality

- **Coherence:** Activities are tightly mapped to the narrative content.
- **Complexity:** Unjumble and Error-correction tasks are calibrated for B2 complexity.
- **Model Answer:** The essay model answer displays the required breadth of analysis.
