## Summary Evaluation

The module provides a deep, intellectually stimulating overview of Kyivan Rus culture. The language is sophisticated, utilizing a rich historical and academic register appropriate for B2+ level. The narrative successfully integrates cultural details with a strong decolonization lens, clearly distinguishing the Kyivan heritage from later imperial appropriations.

## Scores (0-10)

- **Naturalness (10/10):** The Ukrainian is flawless, utilizing complex sentence structures and idiomatic historical terminology (e.g., _нарочита чадь_, _скрипторій_, _плінфа_). No Russianisms detected after the latest fix.
- **Pedagogical Depth (10/10):** Excellent progression from literacy to high art and music. The activity reduction to 6 high-priority seminar types significantly improves focus.
- **Decolonization (10/10):** The module explicitly addresses the "Common Cradle" myth and the appropriation of historical nomenclature, using the "Prosecutor's Voice" effectively.
