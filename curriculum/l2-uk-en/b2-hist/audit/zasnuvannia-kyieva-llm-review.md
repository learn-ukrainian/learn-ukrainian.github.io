## 1. Linguistic Accuracy (Ukrainian)

- **Naturalness:** The narrative flow is engaging, balancing legend and historical fact effectively. Discourse markers are used well.
- **Terminology:** Key terms like "городище", "літопис", "данина" are used correctly.

## 2. Pedagogical Alignment

- **Level Appropriateness:** Vocabulary load is high but appropriate for a specific history track.
- **Content-Based Instruction:** The module successfully uses the legend of Kyiv's founding as a vehicle for language learning and historical analysis.
- **Activity Quality:** The seminar-style activities (reading analysis, comparative study) encourage deep engagement with the text.

## 3. Factual & Historical Accuracy

- **Legend vs. History:** The module correctly distinguishes between the Chronicle's legend and archaeological evidence (St. Sophia/Old Kyiv Hill settlements from 5th-6th c.).
- **Decolonization:** It effectively counters imperial narratives by emphasizing Kyiv's antiquity and independent development prior to "Russian" historiography claims.
- **Sources:** References to "Povest Vremennykh Lit" are accurate.
