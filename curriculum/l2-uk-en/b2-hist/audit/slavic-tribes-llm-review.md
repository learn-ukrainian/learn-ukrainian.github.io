## 1. Linguistic Accuracy (Ukrainian)

- **Grammar & Syntax:** The module demonstrates a high level of linguistic sophistication appropriate for B2. The use of participial phrases and complex subordinate clauses is consistent with the historical register.
- **Naturalness:** The narrative is engaging and reads like high-quality Ukrainian non-fiction. The metaphors (e.g., "мозаїка", "ковдра") are culturally resonant and natural.
- **Terminology:** Tribal names (поляни, древляни, etc.) and social terms (дружина, смерди, закупи) are used with precision.

## 2. Pedagogical Alignment

- **Level Appropriateness:** The density of information and vocabulary is challenging but manageable for B2 learners.
- **Activity Quality:** The activities in the YAML file (mapped in meta) focus on regional categorization and historical analysis, which supports both language acquisition and historical understanding.
- **Immersion:** Excellent use of target language for complex historical concepts.

## 3. Factual & Historical Accuracy

- **Tribal Geography:** The descriptions of tribal locations (e.g., Polyany in the middle Dnieper, Derevlyany in Polissia) align with "The Primary Chronicle" and modern historical mapping.
- **Decolonization Lens:** The module explicitly addresses regional diversity as a foundation of national identity and counters the "one people" imperial myth by showing the distinct characters of the various tribal unions.
- **Accuracy:** The mention of the Stilsko Hillfort for the White Croats is a great touch of modern archaeological depth.
