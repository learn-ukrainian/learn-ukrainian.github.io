## Naturalness Quality Checklist (Score: 9/10)

- [x] **Subject consistency** - Subjects (szlachta, peasants, Cossacks) are clearly maintained and logically connected through the narrative.
- [x] **Discourse markers** - Used naturally: "однак", "натомість", "зрештою", "паралельно", "отже".
- [x] **Topic coherence** - Narrative flows from the Lublin Union through social/religious changes to the rise of Cossack resistance.
- [x] **No template repetition** - Sentence structures are varied; no repetitive "X is Y" patterns.
- [x] **Moderate intensifiers** - Used sparingly for historical emphasis ("надзвичайно родючі", "жорстке кріпацтво").
- [x] **No double superlatives** - Precise descriptors used throughout.
- [x] **Natural transitions** - Transitions between sections feel organic and historically grounded.

## Linguistic Purity

- **Linguistic Purity:** No Russian phonetic or lexical "ghost words" found. Authentic Ukrainian terminology used (e.g., "кіт" not "кот" - though not used here, the principle holds).
- **Historical Authenticity:** Terms like "фільварок", "панщина", "схизматик" are used correctly in their historical context.

## Decolonization Alignment

- The module successfully frames the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth not just as an "oasis of tolerance" for the nobility, but as a colonial power for the Ukrainian peasantry.
- Explicitly addresses the "voluntary union" myth and the "civilizational progress" narrative of the empire.
- Focuses on the agency of the Ukrainian people (brotherhoods, Cossacks) rather than just the actions of the occupying powers.

## Strengths
- **Instructional Core:** Rich, detailed narrative (3994 words) that avoids being just a list of facts.
- **Primary Sources:** Excellent selection of contrasting perspectives (peasant complaint vs. magnate universal).
- **Pedagogy:** Strong CBI approach with high-quality model answer in the essay section.

## Weaknesses
- **Complexity:** The linguistic level is high, as expected for B2, but some sentences in the primary source analysis could be challenging (this is acceptable for the level).
