- Level placement: ✅ Confirmed A1 - Completing alphabet acquisition before grammatical instruction

## Vocabulary Check
Core words verified for high-frequency:
- **день** (day) - Extremely high-frequency time word, essential daily vocabulary
- **центр** (center) - High-frequency urban vocabulary, common in navigation
- **чай** (tea) - Universal food/beverage term, high cultural significance
- **школа** (school) - High-frequency institutional vocabulary
- **гарний** (beautiful/good) - One of most common positive adjectives
- **жити** (to live) - High-frequency basic verb, existential meaning

Frequency source: Ukrainian National Linguistic Corpus (lcorp.ulif.org.ua)
- "День" is among the most frequent nouns (time expressions)
- "Гарний" is the standard positive adjective, extremely common
- "Жити" is a core existential verb, high frequency in all text types

Any surprises: All words are appropriately high-frequency. Strong mix of concrete nouns and essential verbs/adjectives.

## Cultural Hook (verified facts)

### Hook 1: Kyiv Not Kiev - Правопис як акт деколонізації
**Fact:** The transliteration "Kyiv" (not "Kiev") became the international standard in 2019, reflecting the correct Ukrainian pronunciation with the unique Ukrainian letter И. The "Kiev" spelling comes from Russian transliteration. This change represents linguistic decolonization—recognizing Ukrainian language autonomy after centuries of Russification.

- https://czo.gov.ua/translit (Official Ukrainian transliteration standards)

**How to use:** In Cultural Insight section, explain that "Kyiv" uses Ukrainian sounds (К-и-ї-в), while "Kiev" uses Russian sounds. This connects alphabet learning to modern Ukrainian identity and international recognition. Show how the letters Ї and И are distinctly Ukrainian.

### Hook 2: Iotated vowels (Є, Ї, Ю, Я) - Soft sounds of Ukrainian
**Fact:** The four iotated vowels (Є, Ї, Ю, Я) represent combinations of [j] + vowel and are characteristic of Slavic languages. In Ukrainian, these letters help preserve the melodic, flowing sound of the language and mark softness in preceding consonants. Unlike Russian, Ukrainian orthography consistently uses І (not Ы), giving the language its distinctive "lighter" sound.

**How to use:** In Presentation section, frame iotated vowels as part of Ukrainian's "musical" quality. They're not random—they're systematic and make Ukrainian sound distinct from Russian (which uses Ы instead of І). This reinforces that Ukrainian has its own phonetic identity.

## Teaching Notes
- **Unique Seven** (Г, Ґ, Ж, Ш, Щ, Ч, Ц) are challenging for English speakers—need drilling with audio
- **И vs І distinction** is crucial: И is the "hard i" that English speakers struggle with, but it's essential for words like "Київ"
- **Soft sign (Ь)** doesn't exist in English—needs careful explanation with before/after comparison (кіт vs кість)
- Iotated vowels should be taught as "two sounds in one letter" (Є = [je], Ї = [ji], etc.)
- Cultural hook on Kyiv spelling connects grammar to real-world political/cultural context
- Warn about italic variants (г vs г) to prevent confusion when reading Ukrainian texts in different fonts
