## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Missing Plan-Required Vocabulary
- **Location**: Throughout text.
- **Problem**: The plan requires `брат` (brother), `сестра` (sister), `тато` (father). These are excellent examples of "natural gender" (masculine person = masculine noun) which makes the concept easier to grasp. They are currently missing.
- **Fix**: Add these to the "Common Patterns" lists or replace less common furniture items with these high-frequency family members.

### Issue 2: Unseen Vocabulary in Activities
- **Location**: Activity `group-sort` ("Sort by Gender").
- **Problem**: The words `помідор` (tomato) and `огірок` (cucumber) appear in the activity but are not in the content text (the Food list has bread, cheese, juice, water, potato, onion). While it tests pattern recognition, it's safer to include them in the text first.
- **Fix**: Add `помідор` and `огірок` to the "Masculine" food list in the "Common Patterns" section.

## Fix Plan to Reach 10/10

### Educational & Pedagogy: 9/10 → 10/10

**What to fix:**
1.  **Section "Common Patterns to Memorize"**:
    *   **Action**: In the **Masculine** list, add: `- Family: тато (dad), брат (brother)`.
    *   **Action**: In the **Feminine** list, add: `- Family: мама (mom), сестра (sister)`.
    *   **Reason**: Satisfies plan requirements and provides intuitive biological gender anchors.
2.  **Section "Common Patterns to Memorize"**:
    *   **Action**: Update Masculine Food list: Change "сік (juice)" to "помідор (tomato), огірок (cucumber)".
    *   **Reason**: Aligns content with the `group-sort` activity items, preventing user frustration with unknown words.

## Verdict

**PASS**

The module is excellent—culturally rich, linguistically accurate, and well-structured. The "S.T.A.L.K.E.R." and "Folklore" sections add unique value. The only fixes needed are adding the missing family vocabulary (required by plan) and aligning the activity words with the text.
