## Auto-Fail Checklist Results

- Russianisms: [CLEAN]
- Calques: [CLEAN]
- Grammar scope: [CLEAN]
- Activity errors: [Activity 4 item 12 ambiguous]
- Beginner safety: 5/5

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Editing Artifact
- **Location**: Line 17 / Section "Warm-up"
- **Original**: "Let's start! (Let's begin our journey with prepositions!)"
- **Problem**: Duplicate sentences, likely a leftover from an LLM rephrasing suggestion.
- **Fix**: "Let's start!"

### Issue 2: Ambiguous Distractor
- **Location**: Activities / Activity 4 / Item 12
- **Original**: `sentence: ___ він повернувся?` options includes `Коли`
- **Problem**: "Коли він повернувся?" (When did he return?) is a grammatically valid and common sentence. In a fill-in-the-blank, distractors should ideally be grammatically incorrect or logically impossible in context.
- **Fix**: Change option `Коли` to `Хто` or `Що` (grammatically invalid in this slot) or `Який`.

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| - | - | - | - |

(No errors found. "Зі Львова" and "зі школи" correctly use euphonic forms.)

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test: 5/5
- Overwhelmed? [Pass] - Structure is very distinct (Place vs Direction vs Origin).
- Instructions clear? [Pass]
- Quick wins? [Pass] - "The Question tells you the Case!" is a great heuristic.
- Ukrainian scary? [Pass]
- Come back tomorrow? [Pass]

Emotional beats:
- Welcome: Yes, clear Warm-up.
- Curiosity: "Key to understanding Ukrainian prepositions!"
- Quick wins: The tables clearly link question word -> case.
- Encouragement: "Це була чудова робота! Ви великі молодці!"

## Strengths
- **Conceptual Clarity**: The explicit linking of *Де?* (Locative), *Куди?* (Acc/Gen), and *Звідки?* (Gen) is handled perfectly.
- **Phonetics**: IPA is provided for sentences, which is excellent for A1.
- **Practicality**: The distinction between "вдома" (location) and "додому" (direction) is emphasized, which is a common stumbling block.
- **Euphony**: The lesson correctly models "зі Львова" and "зі школи" without overwhelming the learner with complex rules.

## Fix Plan to Reach 10/10

### Coherence: 9/10 → 10/10
**What to fix:**
1. Line 17: Remove ` (Let's begin our journey with prepositions!)` — Removes editing debris.

### Activities: 9/10 → 10/10
**What to fix:**
1. Activity 4, Item 12: Change option `Коли` to `Хто` — Removes validity ambiguity.
