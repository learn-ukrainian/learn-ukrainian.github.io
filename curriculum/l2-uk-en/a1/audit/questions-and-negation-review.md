## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Duplicate Activity Items
- **Location**: Activity 1 (Quiz: Question Word Meanings)
- **Problem**: Three pairs of questions test the exact same thing.
    - Q1 ("meaning of «де»") is same as Q11 ("corresponds to 'where'").
    - Q2 ("meaning of 'why'") is same as Q12 ("how do you ask 'why'").
    - Q4 ("meaning of «хто»") is same as Q10 ("question word for 'who'").
- **Fix**: Replace duplicates with new questions (e.g., testing "коли", "скільки", or "як") or remove them.

### Issue 2: The "Where From" Genitive Trap
- **Location**: Section "Production", Task 2 ("Ask where they're from") and Model Answer ("Я з Києва").
- **Problem**: The student is asked to create a conversation. If they want to say "I am from London", they will likely say "Я з Лондон" (error) because they haven't learned the Genitive case change (Лондона). The text provides examples ("з Америки", "з Києва") but doesn't explain the change from the base forms ("Америка", "Київ").
- **Fix**: Add a small "Grammar Note" in the Presentation section under Mini-Dialogue 2: "Notice how *Київ* becomes *Києва* and *Америка* becomes *Америки* after **з** (from). This is called the **Genitive case**. Don't worry about memorizing the rules yet — just learn these phrases as set expressions for now!"

## Fix Plan to Reach 9/10 (REQUIRED)

### Activities: 8/10 → 10/10

**What to fix:**
1. **Activity 1 (Quiz)**: Replace Q10, Q11, Q12 with unique questions.
   - Replace Q10 (Who) with: "Which word means 'how much'?" -> "скільки"
   - Replace Q11 (Where) with: "Translate: 'When'?" -> "коли"
   - Replace Q12 (Why) with: "Choose the word for 'always'." -> "завжди" (Frequency adverb check).

### Beginner Safety / Pedagogy: 8/10 → 9/10

**What to fix:**
1. **Section "Presentation" / Mini-Dialogue 2**: Add a callout or note.
   - Action: Insert `> [!note] Grammar Sneak Peek`
   - Content: "You might notice *Київ* changes to *Києва* and *Америка* to *Америки* after **з** (from). This is called the **Genitive case**. Don't worry about memorizing the rules yet — just learn these phrases as set expressions for now!"

### Projected Overall After Fixes

**9.1/10**

## Verdict

**PASS**

The module is strong but needs minor cleanup in activities (duplicates) and a safety rail for the Genitive case examples to avoid confusing beginners.
