## Scores

| # | Dimension | Score | Auto-fail | Evidence |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Experience Quality | 10/10 | <7 | Excellent flow, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. reference creates high engagement. |
| 2 | Coherence | 10/10 | <7 | Clear progression from rule to practice to context. |
| 3 | Relevance | 10/10 | <7 | Highly relevant contexts (airport, post office). |
| 4 | Educational | 10/10 | <7 | Explanations are crystal clear and beginner-friendly. |
| 5 | Language | 9/10 | <8 | Uses "мати" (to have) for possession to drill Accusative SVO, which is pedagogically justified but slightly less natural than "у мене є". "Відкривати вікно" is used instead of "відчиняти", an acceptable A1 simplification. |
| 6 | Pedagogy | 9/10 | <7 | Verb "шукати" (to look for) is tested in activities but not explicitly introduced in the presentation table. |
| 7 | Immersion | 9/10 | <6 | Good balance for A1.2. |
| 8 | Activities | 10/10 | <7 | Varied, accurate, and directly reinforce the material. |
| 9 | Richness | 10/10 | <6 | Exceeds word count with high-value examples and dialogues. |
| 10 | Beginner Safety | 10/10 | <7 | "Would I Continue?" 5/5. |
| 11 | LLM Fingerprint | 10/10 | <7 | Feels handcrafted and authentic. |
| 12 | Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | <9 | No errors found. |

**Weighted Overall:** (15 + 10 + 10 + 12 + 9.9 + 10.8 + 9 + 13 + 9 + 13 + 10 + 15) / 14 = **9.76/10**

*None. The module is excellent.*

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| 62 | Я відкриваю вікно. | Я відчиняю вікно. | Stylistic (A1 simplification "відкривати" accepted) |

*Note: "Відкривати" is generally accepted for A1 to cover all "opening" actions (books, boxes, windows), though "відчиняти" is precise for windows.*

## Beginner Safety Audit

- Quick wins? [Yes - "I see an anomaly!"]

Emotional beats: 4 found

- Curiosity: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. reference
- Quick wins: Simple transformation rules
- Encouragement: "It's not a burden; it's a key to real conversation!"

## Strengths
- **Cultural connection**: The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. "anomaly" example is brilliant for the target audience.
- **Clarity**: The distinction between Nominative and Accusative for Feminine nouns is explained perfectly.
- **Context**: The Post Office dialogue is very practical.

## Verdict

**PASS**

This is a high-quality A1 module that effectively teaches the core concept while maintaining engagement. The minor pedagogical note regarding "шукати" and the stylistic choice of "мати/відкривати" do not detract from the successful execution of the learning objectives.
