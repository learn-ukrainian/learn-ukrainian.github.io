# Checkpoint: First Contact

> **Note:** Congratulations! You've completed A1.1 — the first phase of your Ukrainian journey. This module reviews everything you've learned so far.

## Warm-up: How Far You've Come

Take a moment to appreciate what you've accomplished! In just 9 modules, you've gone from zero Ukrainian to being able to:

✅ **Read** the entire Cyrillic alphabet — both print and italic forms
✅ **Identify** noun gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) from endings
✅ **Use** demonstratives (цей/ця/це/ці) to point at objects
✅ **Conjugate** Class I verbs (-ати) and Class II verbs (-ити)
✅ **Ask** questions and **negate** sentences
✅ **Order** food at a restaurant and compliment the cook
✅ **Understand** basic Ukrainian culture and hospitality

That's a lot! This checkpoint will help you consolidate everything before moving forward to A1.2, where you'll learn cases, possessives, and city navigation.

> 💡 **Study Tip:** If you struggle with any section below, go back to the corresponding module and review. There's no shame in revisiting — that's how learning works!

## Review: The Cyrillic Alphabet (Modules 01-02)

### Key Letters to Remember

| Category | Letters | Watch Out For |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **True Friends** | А, Е, І, О, К, М, Т | Same as English |
| **False Friends** | В=v, Н=n, Р=r, С=s, У=u, Х=kh | Look like English but sound different! |
| **Unique** | Ґ, Ж, Ш, Щ, Ч, Ц | No English equivalent |
| **Iotated** | Є, Ї, Ю, Я | Contain "y" sound |
| **Soft Sign** | Ь | Softens the previous consonant |

### Italic Traps

Watch these letters in italic — they look different!
- **т** → looks like "m"
- **п** → looks like "n"
- **д** → looks like "g"
- **и** → looks like "u"

> 📜 **Remember:** Ukrainian has unique letters (Ї, Є, Ґ, І) that Russian doesn't have. These are markers of Ukrainian identity!

## Review: Noun Gender (Module 03)

### The Three-Second Gender Rule

| Ending | Gender | Examples |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Consonant | **Masculine** | стіл, банк, друг |
| -а / -я | **Feminine** | книга, земля, кава |
| -о / -е | **Neuter** | вікно, море, яблуко |

**Exceptions to know:**
- **Тато** (dad) = masculine despite -о ending
- **Ніч** (night) = feminine despite consonant ending

## Review: Verbs (Modules 06, 08)

### Class I (-ати) Endings

| Person | Ending | Example (читати) |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| я | -ю | читаю |
| ти | -єш | читаєш |
| він/вона | -є | читає |
| ми | -ємо | читаємо |
| ви | -єте | читаєте |
| вони | -ють | читають |

### Class II (-ити) Endings

| Person | Ending | Example (говорити) |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| я | -ю/-лю | говорю |
| ти | -иш | говориш |
| він/вона | -ить | говорить |
| ми | -имо | говоримо |
| ви | -ите | говорите |
| вони | -ять | говорять |

### Key Irregular Verbs

| Verb | я | ти | він/вона | ми | ви | вони |
|------|---|---|---------|---|---|-----|
| **їсти** | їм | їси | їсть | їмо | їсте | їдять |
| **пити** | п'ю | п'єш | п'є | п'ємо | п'єте | п'ють |
| **хотіти** | хочу | хочеш | хоче | хочемо | хочете | хочуть |

## Review: Questions & Negation (Module 07)

### Question Words

| Word | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| що | what | Що це? |
| хто | who | Хто це? |
| де | where | Де ти? |
| коли | when | Коли? |
| чому | why | Чому? |
| як | how | Як справи? |
| скільки | how much/many | Скільки коштує? |

### Negation = Just add НЕ

- Я читаю → Я **не** читаю
- Вона працює → Вона **не** працює

## Cultural Insight: What You've Learned 🇺🇦

In these 9 modules, you've also absorbed Ukrainian culture:

**Language as Identity:**
- Ukrainian has unique letters (Ї, Є, Ґ, І) that mark it as distinct from Russian
- The language survived centuries of suppression (Ems Ukaz, Valuev Circular)
- Speaking Ukrainian today is an act of cultural affirmation

**Hospitality:**
- Refusing food is rude — always accept at least a little
- "Смачного!" before eating, "Дякую!" after
- The phrase "Ще трохи?" (A little more?) is inevitable

**Food:**
- Борщ is Ukrainian, recognized by UNESCO
- Every grandmother has her own recipe
- Food carries memory — Holodomor, resilience, family

> 📜 **History Bite:** You've begun your journey with the Ukrainian language at a critical time. The language is thriving, with more Ukrainians than ever choosing to speak it daily. Your learning supports this cultural renaissance!
