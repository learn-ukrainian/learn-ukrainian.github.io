## Issues
**None found.** This module is exemplary.

## Pedagogical Highlights

### Example 1: чи vs Rising Intonation (lines 58-75)
> The simplest way to turn any statement into a yes/no question is to add **чи** at the beginning:
>
> **The pattern:** Чи + subject + verb?
>
> In casual speech, Ukrainians often skip **чи** and just use rising intonation:
> - Ти читаєш? ↗ (You read? = Do you read?)

**Why it works:** Gives formal pattern first, then casual variant. Prepares learners for both registers.

---

### Example 2: Myth Buster on Question Word Order (lines 111-114)
> **Myth:** "Question words must come first in Ukrainian."
> **Fact:** While they usually do, Ukrainians often move them for emphasis! "Ти куди йдеш?" (You where going? = Where exactly are you going?) feels more urgent than "Куди ти йдеш?"

**Why it works:** Addresses learner assumption, shows pragmatic usage, demonstrates Ukrainian's flexible word order.

---

### Example 3: Cultural Insight on Directness (lines 213-227)
> Ukrainians are generally more direct than English speakers when asking questions. Simple questions are common even with new acquaintances - especially from older generations.
>
> This isn't rude - it's genuine interest! Ukrainians value honesty and directness in conversation.

**Why it works:** Explains potential culture shock, reframes "directness" as "interest," gives practical examples.

---

### Example 4: Double Negation Explanation (lines 168-177)
> **Important:** **Ніколи** (never) is already negative, but Ukrainian uses **double negation** - you still add **не**!
>
> - я **ніколи не** п'ю каву. (I never drink coffee.) ✅
> - я ніколи п'ю каву. ❌ (Wrong - missing не!)
>
> This is called **double negation** and it's mandatory in Ukrainian (unlike English where "I never don't drink" would be wrong).

**Why it works:** Explicit rule, correct/incorrect examples, cross-linguistic comparison prevents English interference.

## Recommendation
✅ **PASS - Excellent quality**

This module requires no revisions. It teaches interrogative and negative structures with:
- Clear, systematic rules
- Cultural context (directness, honesty)
- Pragmatic variation (чи vs. intonation)
- Cross-linguistic awareness (double negation)

## Action Items
**None required.** Module is production-ready.

---

## Summary

Module 07 successfully teaches question formation and negation with clarity and cultural sensitivity. The progression from yes/no questions → wh-questions → negation → frequency adverbs is pedagogically sound. Cultural insights about Ukrainian directness add depth and prevent misunderstandings. Engagement boxes enhance memorability.
