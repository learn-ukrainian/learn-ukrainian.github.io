## Strengths

-   **Negation**: Clear explanation of `ніколи не` (double negation), a common stumbling block.
-   **Directness**: Cultural insight on "Direct Questions" helps learners adjust their social expectations.
-   **Structure**: The `quiz: Negative Sentence Order` cleverly uses capitalization cues to reinforce standard word order.

## Issues

1.  **Reference Error**: In the Vocabulary table, the entry for **йти** says `(M06)` in the note. However, `йти` was not explicitly taught in Module 06 (which focused on regular Class I verbs). This reference might confuse learners looking back for it.

## Action Items

1.  **Remove Reference**: Delete `(M06)` from the note for **йти** in the vocabulary table. [SAFE]

## Recommendation

✅ **PASS** (with specific fix)
