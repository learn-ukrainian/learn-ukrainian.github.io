## Strengths

1. **Continuity with M01**: The "code-breaker" metaphor continues naturally. References "19 from Module 1, plus 14 from this module" — learners feel progress.

2. **Г vs Ґ Distinction**: Critical for Ukrainian identity. Explains that Russian lost Ґ but Ukrainian kept it — culturally accurate and important.

3. **Kyiv/Kiev Correction**: The Myth Buster explaining why "Kyiv" is correct (AP Style Guide 2019) is culturally significant and timely.

4. **Italic Warning Section**: Unique and valuable. Most courses ignore italic forms, leading to confusion with handwritten Ukrainian. The table showing т→"m", п→"n", д→"g" is essential.

5. **Cultural Depth**:
   - UNESCO borscht heritage (2022)
   - Valuev Circular history (1863)
   - The Witcher reference (Відьмак)
   - Rich embedding without being preachy

6. **Practical Phrases**: Teaches immediately useful words (привіт, дякую, будь ласка, до побачення) with correct transliteration.

## Exemplary Passages

### Г vs Ґ Distinction (line 61)
> "The letters **Г** and **Ґ** are perhaps the most important distinction. **Г** (hook) makes a soft breathy 'h' sound. **Ґ** (hook with hat) makes a hard 'g' sound like in English 'go.' Russian lost the **Ґ** sound centuries ago, but Ukrainian kept it!"

**Why it works:** Critical distinction for Ukrainian identity; explained with memorable comparison.

### Cultural Resistance (lines 210-214)
> "The Ukrainian alphabet is a tool of resistance. During Soviet times, Ukrainian language and culture were suppressed. Speaking Ukrainian in school was punished. Ukrainian books were banned. Yet people kept the language alive in villages, in songs, in secret poetry."

**Why it works:** Historically accurate; emotionally resonant; frames language learning as cultural participation.

### Kyiv Myth Buster (lines 86-89)
> "**Myth:** 'Київ' is just the Ukrainian spelling.
> **Fact:** 'Київ' (Kýyiv) is the correct Ukrainian name. 'Kiev' is Russian. Since 1991, Ukraine is independent. The world now uses 'Kyiv' to respect Ukrainian identity. The AP Style Guide switched in 2019!"

**Why it works:** Addresses common misconception; provides authoritative source (AP Style Guide).

## Issues

### Issue 1: Й Not Explained in Presentation ✅ FIXED

**Location:** Summary mentioned "**Й:** The short 'y' sound" but Й was not taught in the Presentation section.

**Resolution:** Added new section "### The Short Y (Й)" after "The Hard I (И)" and before "The Italic Warning". Section includes:
- Explanation of the /j/ sound
- Table with letter, sound, example (йогурт), and English equivalent
- Note about Й appearing at word/syllable endings (край)

**Status:** ✅ FIXED (2025-12-22)

## Red Flags Check

- **Word salad:** None. Content is substantive and purposeful.
- **Repetitive patterns:** None. Variety maintained.
- **Forced mixing:** None. Ukrainian and English clearly separated.
- **Undefined terms:** None. All letters properly introduced.
- **Russianisms:** None. Standard Ukrainian throughout.
- **Factual errors:** None detected.

---

## Minor Observations (Not Issues)

1. **Complete Alphabet section (lines 222-238)** could be formatted as a single reference table rather than prose lists. However, the current format works and doesn't harm learning.

2. **Soft sign examples (lines 95-99)** use words that might not be in vocabulary yet (кон, брат, брать). However, they're only used to illustrate sound differences, not as vocabulary to learn.

---

## Recommendations for Future Modules

1. Ensure all letters mentioned in Summary are explicitly taught in Presentation
2. The Italic Warning section is valuable — consider similar "common confusion" sections in later modules
3. Continue the cultural embedding pattern; it adds depth without overwhelming
