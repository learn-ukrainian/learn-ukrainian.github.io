| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | "Subject pronoun drop" explanation is very clear. |

| **Activities** | 5/5 | Good mix of drills. |
| **Overall** | **5/5** | **EXCELLENT** |

## Strengths

-   **Theory-First**: Explicitly teaching the conjugation pattern (`-ати` -> `-аю`) rather than rote memorization.
-   **Cultural Note**: Verbs as "musicality" and "doing" helps frame the grammar positively.
-   **Structure**: Logical progression from pattern to practice.

## Issues

1.  **Rule Consistency**: The module defines Class I verbs as ending in **-ати/-яти** (Line 51). However, the vocabulary list and activities include **розуміти** (to understand), which ends in **-іти**. While it follows the *conjugation* pattern, it confuses the *identification* rule for beginners.
2.  **Grammar Error**: Line 139 says `Тут, у парк.` (Here, [into] the park) as a location answer. This incorrectly uses the Accusative case instead of the Locative (`у парку`).

## Action Items

1.  **Remove `розуміти`**: Replace it with **співати** or **читати** in activities to maintain strict adherence to the `-ати` rule for now. [SAFE]
2.  **Fix Line 139**: Changing `Тут, у парк` to `Тут, у парку` (Locative) or just `Тут.` to avoid confusing the learner with untaught cases. [SAFE]

## Recommendation

✅ **PASS** (with specific fixes)
