- **Fix**: `> [!culture] **Ukrainian Traditions: Shopping Culture**`

## Fix Plan to Reach 10/10

### Richness: 9/10 → 10/10

**What to fix:**
1. Section "Cultural Insight": Change `> 🎭 **Ukrainian Traditions...` → `> [!culture] **Ukrainian Traditions...` — aligns with project standards for engagement callouts.

### Projected Overall After Fixes

```
(137.9 + 0.09) / 14 = 9.86/10 (Rounding to 9.9)

## Verdict

**PASS**

This is an excellent module that perfectly targets the A1 learner. It demystifies the Accusative case for things with clear rules and relevant examples. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. reference adds a unique flavor. The only suggested change is a minor formatting tweak to the cultural callout.
