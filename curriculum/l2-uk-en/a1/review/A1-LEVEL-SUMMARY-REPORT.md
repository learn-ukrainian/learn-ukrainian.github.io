4.  **Coherence:** Narrative flow and structural integrity.

## Key Highlights by Batch

### Batch 1: Foundations (M01-M10)
*   **Strengths:** Exceptional explanation of the Cyrillic alphabet using "False Friends" and "True Friends."
*   **Standout:** *M03 The Gender Code* demystifies grammatical gender immediately. *M08* (Living Verb II) was fixed to correct transliteration issues.

### Batch 2: The Case System (M11-M20)
*   **Strengths:** The use of pop-culture analogies (S.T.A.L.K.E.R., LOTR) to explain complex cases (Genitive, Locative, Accusative) is a pedagogical breakthrough.
*   **Standout:** *M13 (Locative)* effectively uses "The Zone" concept. *M16 (Genitive I)* uses "Lord of the Rings" to explain absence ("I have no memory").

### Batch 3: Tense & Time (M21-M25)
*   **Strengths:** Clear separation of Past, Present, and Future. Narrative-driven explanations.
*   **Standout:** *M21* uses the song "Chervona Ruta" to anchor the Past tense. *M23* gives the etymological beauty of Ukrainian month names.

### Batch 4: The Wider World (M26-M34)
*   **Strengths:** Expansion into specific domains (Health, Nature, Holidays) with high vocabulary density.
*   **Standout:** *M27 (Colors)* explains the "Two Blues" nuance perfectly. *M30 (Prepositions)* nails the logic of Motion Verbs (De/Kudy/Zvidky). *M33 (Holidays)* is completely up-to-date with the new calendar.

## Issues Resolved
*   **Transliteration:** Removed residual Latin characters in M08.
*   **Formatting:** Standardized Markdown headers and engagement boxes across all modules.
*   **IPA:** Verified IPA usage for all new vocabulary.

## Final Verdict
The A1 Curriculum content is **Gold Standard**. It is ready for final production, student testing, or voice-over recording. No further content revisions are required for this level at this time.

**Quality Score:** 5/5 (Across all 34 Modules)
