**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Reviewer:** Claude (AI)

## Scores

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Excellent flow from "True Friends" to "False Friends" to "New Letters". |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Perfectly targets absolute beginners. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | The "Cognate Strategy" (teaching letters via words you already know) is highly effective. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Clear, engaging English. Authentic Ukrainian examples. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | Grouping by shape familiarity is superior to alphabetical order. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Appropriate for Module 1 (English heavy, Ukrainian examples). |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | Varied types (match, quiz, fill-in, anagram). Good volume. |
| **Overall** | **5/5** | **EXEMPLARY** |

## Strengths

-   **Structure**: Grouping letters by "True Friends" vs "False Friends" is a brilliant pedagogical choice that lowers anxiety.
-   **Engaging Tone**: The "Warm-up" sets a great hook ("You're about to crack a code...").
-   **Linguistic Purity**: "Myth Buster" box (Line 80) correctly frames Ukrainian/Russian differences without using Russian phonetics as a crutch.
-   **Cultural Context**: Identifying `Ґ` as a sound "Russian lost" (Line 147) and mentioning the "Kyivan Rus" origin of Cyrillic (Line 61) empowers the learner with "Prosecutor's Voice".

## Issues

*None identified.* The module is structurally and pedagogically sound.

## Action Items

-   None.

## Recommendation

✅ **PASS**
