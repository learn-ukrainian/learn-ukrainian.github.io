## Scores Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Lesson Quality | 10/10 | Exceptional — feels like a caring, enthusiastic tutor. Perfect "Would I Continue?" 5/5. |
| Coherence | 10/10 | Logical flow: True Friends → False Friends → New Letters. Each builds on the previous. |
| Relevance | 10/10 | Perfectly aligned with plan outline. All 5 sections present. |
| Educational | 9/10 | Clear explanations, excellent use of cognates as entry point. Could add one more guided example before Production. |
| Language | 10/10 | English is warm, B1-readable, uses contractions naturally. Ukrainian is minimal and correct (appropriate for M01). |
| Pedagogy | 10/10 | PPP executed perfectly. Present (letter tables) → Practice (international words, mini-dialogues) → Produce (decode words with IPA). |
| L1/L2 Balance | 10/10 | 7.1% Ukrainian immersion — within 5-15% target for M01. Perfect scaffolding. |

| Richness | 9/10 | 4 engagement callouts (Did You Know, Myth Buster, Pop Culture Moment, Real World). S.T.A.L.K.E.R. reference is a great cultural hook. |
| Beginner Safety | 10/10 | All 5 emotional beats present. Excellent quick wins. "You already know a third of it" is reassuring from the start. |
| LLM Fingerprint | 9/10 | Natural tutor voice throughout. "You're about to crack a code" — engaging, not generic. No AI patterns detected. |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | State Standard §4.1.1 compliance confirmed. All letter-sound correspondences accurate. IPA verified (10 transcriptions in Production). |

## L1/L2 Balance Analysis

- **Target immersion:** 5-15% Ukrainian (M01)
- **Actual immersion:** ~7.1% Ukrainian
- **Assessment:** On target. English predominates appropriately for the very first module. Ukrainian appears in letter tables, example words, and two mini-dialogues — all with transliteration.

## IPA Verification

- Transcriptions checked: 10 (Production section) + 31 (vocabulary file)
- Errors found: 1 (підсумок missing stress mark — fixed)
- All corrected: Yes

## State Standard Check

- Grammar point: Ukrainian alphabet, letter-sound correspondence
- Standard reference: §4.1.1 (Український алфавіт. Друковані та писані літери), §4.1.4 (Голосні та приголосні звуки)
- Compliance: Fully compliant. Module teaches printed letters (друковані літери) with sound values.

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test:
- Overwhelmed? Pass — pacing is comfortable, starts with familiar ground
- Instructions clear? Pass — every section explains its purpose
- Quick wins? Pass — True Friends give immediate "I can read this!" moments
- Ukrainian scary? Pass — introduced through international cognates
- Come back tomorrow? Pass — ends with celebration of progress
- **Result:** 5/5

Emotional beats found: 6+
- Welcome: Yes ("You're about to crack a code...")
- Curiosity: Yes ("That's where things get interesting")
- Quick wins: 3+ (True Friends, "You can read it right now", "Football!", "You can decode...")
- Encouragement: 2+ ("it only takes a few hours", "And now you can read them!")
- Progress marker: Yes ("Today you learned 19 letters. That's more than half the alphabet!")

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing Т in Group-Sort Activity
**Location:** Activity 3 (Letter Types), True Friends group
**Original:** Group had only 6 items (А, О, Е, І, К, М) — missing Т
**Problem:** Module teaches 7 True Friends but activity only tested 6
**Fix:** Added Т to True Friends group
**Status:** Fixed

### Issue 2: Ambiguous Quiz Distractor
**Location:** Activity 4 (Reading Words), Item 6 (футбол)
**Original:** Options included both "futbol (football)" and "futbol" — nearly identical
**Problem:** Two options look the same, confusing learners
**Fix:** Replaced "futbol" with "futball" (common English misspelling), "футбол" with "phutbol" (Ф misread)
**Status:** Fixed

### Issue 3: Vocabulary IPA Missing Stress
**Location:** vocabulary/01-the-cyrillic-code-i.yaml, item "підсумок"
**Original:** /pidsumɔk/ (no stress mark)
**Problem:** Missing stress mark on second syllable
**Fix:** /pidˈsumɔk/
**Status:** Fixed

## Recommendation

**PASS** — Exceptional first module. Warm, encouraging, well-paced introduction to Cyrillic. The True Friends → False Friends → New Letters progression is pedagogically sound. Engagement callouts (especially the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. reference and Myth Buster) provide cultural depth without overwhelming beginners. Three minor fixes applied (missing letter in group-sort, ambiguous quiz distractor, vocabulary IPA stress mark). All gates pass.
