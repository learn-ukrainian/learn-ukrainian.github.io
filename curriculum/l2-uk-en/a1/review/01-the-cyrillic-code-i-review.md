## Weak Moments & Rewrites

### Weak Moment 1: MINOR — Quiz distractor quality

**Location:** Activities YAML, line 151-157
**Original:**
```yaml
- question: How do you pronounce **футбол**?
  options:
  - text: futbol (football)
    correct: true
  - text: футбол
    correct: false
```

**Problem:** Using Cyrillic as a distractor is confusing — the question asks for pronunciation, showing Cyrillic doesn't help distinguish.

**Status:** Minor issue, not blocking. Distractors generally good across activities.

---

## Linguistic Accuracy Issues

None detected. All letter-sound mappings verified:
- True Friends (А, Е, І, О, К, М, Т) — correct IPA
- False Friends (В=/v/, Н=/n/, Р=/r/, С=/s/, У=/u/, Х=/x/) — correct
- New Letters (Б=/b/, Д=/d/, З=/z/, Л=/l/, П=/p/, Ф=/f/) — correct

---

## Strengths

1. **Brilliant metaphor:** "Cracking a code" makes Cyrillic feel exciting, not intimidating
2. **Perfect pacing:** Three groups of 6-7 letters each, with practice after each group
3. **Cultural richness:** Myth Buster on Ukrainian vs Russian, Cyrillic origins, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game reference
4. **Immediate payoff:** Learner can read 35+ words by end of module
5. **Warm teacher voice:** Encouraging throughout, celebrates progress, anticipates confusion

---

## Issues

### Minor (Non-blocking)

1. **Quiz distractor (line 151):** Cyrillic as pronunciation answer option is confusing
2. **Summary section title:** Uses "# Підсумок" (H1 in Ukrainian) — slightly inconsistent with English module

---

## Recommendation

✅ **PASS** — This is an exemplary A1 module that perfectly executes the Tier 1 beginner experience. Warm, encouraging, well-paced, with immediate payoff. The "code-cracking" metaphor turns alphabet learning into an adventure.

---

## Action Items

1. Quiz distractor (футбол question) — ⏳ MANUAL (optional polish)
2. All other checks — ✅ No action needed
