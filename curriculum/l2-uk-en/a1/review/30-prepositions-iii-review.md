**Overall Score:** 5/5 🌟

## Strengths
1.  **Core Logic:** Establishing that the QUESTION (De vs Kudy) dictates the CASE is the most important rule for prepositions.
2.  **Pairs:** Teaching location/direction pairs (Vdoma/Dodomu) helps memorize the distinction.
3.  **Clarity:** The distinction between "Do" (to a person) and "V/Na" (to a place) is a common error source addressed well.

## Issues
*None.*

## Recommendation
✅ PASS
