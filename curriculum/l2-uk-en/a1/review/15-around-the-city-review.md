**Module:** 15 - Around the City
**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Reviewer:** Claude (AI)

## Scores

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Applies Locative (M13) + new Directional vocabulary effectively. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Navigation is the #1 survival skill for travelers. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | Explains both public transport *and* marshrutky. |
| **Language** | 4/5 | Generally great, but introduces cases (Genitive/Instrumental) implicitly in prepositions table without explicit teaching, which is risky but acceptable as lexical chunks. One minor error in IPA for `вулиця`. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | Excellent real-world tasks (Give Directions). |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Lviv coffee culture + Kyiv Metro voices = high cultural IQ. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | Very comprehensive. |
| **Overall** | **5/5** | **EXCELLENT** |

## Strengths

-   **Realism**: The "Marshrutka" cultural insight is gritty and real. It prepares learners for the actual experience, not just the textbook version.
-   **Audio Cues**: Mentioning the Male/Female voice distinction in Kyiv Metro is a fantastic "insider tip".
-   **Context**: Scenarios cover Lviv (tourism) and Kyiv (metro/commuting).

## Issues

1.  **IPA Error**: The IPA for `вулиця` is given as `/ˈvulɪtsʲɑ/` (Line 815). Standard Ukrainian stress is often on the first syllable `/ˈvulɪtsʲɑ/` (which is correct in the file), but the `ts` affricate is usually transcribed /t͡s/ rather than separate characters. This is minor.
2.  **Implicit Grammar**: The vocab table lists `за` (behind), `перед` (in front), `між` (between). These typically govern the **Instrumental** case (not taught yet). However, in this module, they are treated lexically or with context that avoids case changes (e.g. `між театром` - explicit instrumental ending provided in example without explanation).
    - *Decision*: This is fine for A1 as "set phrases", but teachers should be aware.
3.  **Typos**: In vocab table IPA for `набережна` (Line 820), `/nɑbɛˈrɛʒnɑ/` has stress on `re`. Standard is usually `набережна` with stress on `na` (/ˈnɑbɛrɛʒnɑ/).
4.  **Vocab Table**: `пішки` IPA `/piʃˈkɪ/` (stress on last syllable) is non-standard. Standard is `/ˈpiʃkɪ/` (first syllable).

## Action Items

1.  **Fix IPA for `набережна`**: Change `/nɑbɛˈrɛʒnɑ/` to `/ˈnɑbɛrɛʒnɑ/`. [SAFE]
2.  **Fix IPA for `пішки`**: Change `/piʃˈkɪ/` to `/ˈpiʃkɪ/`. [SAFE]

## Recommendation

✅ **PASS** (with specific fixes)
