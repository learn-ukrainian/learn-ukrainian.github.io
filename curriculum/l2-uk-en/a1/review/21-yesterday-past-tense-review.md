## 3. Educational Value
- **Rating:** 4/5
- **Comments:**
    - **Pedagogical Error:** Line 38 states that the past tense endings "-в/-ла/-ло/-ли" ALWAYS contain the letter "л". This is factually incorrect for the masculine singular form "-в". While historically related, pedantically it confuses students who see "читав" and look for an "л".
    - **Fix:** Clarify that "л" appears in feminine, neuter, and plural forms.

- **Comments:**

        - `було` /buˈlɔ/ (stress on `o`). Current: /ˈbulɔ/.
        - `слухав` /ˈsluxɑv/ (stress on `u`). Current: /sluˈxɑv/.
