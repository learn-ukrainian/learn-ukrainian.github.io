# A1 Level Content Review Summary

**Date:** 2025-12-22
**Reviewer:** Gemini (Antigravity)
**Scope:** Modules 01-34 (A1 Level)
**Status:** ✅ ALL MODULES PASSED

## Overview

A comprehensive content quality review was conducted for all 34 modules in the A1 level. The review focused on pedagogical correctness, language quality, activity density, immersion levels, and technical compliance (audit gates).

## Key Findings & Actions

### 1. IPA Standardization (Major)
A systematic inconsistency was identified in the IPA transcription of the Ukrainian letter **'в'**.
- **Issue:** 'в' was frequently transcribed as `/w/`. Vowel qualities for 'e' were sometimes `/e/` instead of `/ɛ/`. Affricates were sometimes missing ligatures (`/ts/` vs `/t͡s/`).
- **Action:** Standardized all IPA:
    - **'в' → `/v/`** (or `/vʲ/`).
    - **'e' → `/ɛ/`**.
    - **Affricates:** `/t͡s/`, `/t͡ʃ/`, `/d͡z/`, `/d͡ʒ/`.
    - **Stress marks:** Verified.
- **Result:** All 34 modules have consistent, high-quality IPA.

### 2. Pedagogical Consistency
- **Separation of Skills:** Modules clearly separate vocabulary introduction from grammar explanations.
- **Activity variety:** All modules now meet the strict 8+ activity gate, with most exceeding 10 activities.
- **Engagement:** Myths, Culture, and Tips boxes are present in all modules.

### 3. Technical Compliance
- **Audit Script:** All modules passed the `audit_module.py` strict gates for A1.
- **Word Counts:** All modules meet the word count targets (400-500+ for standard, higher for checkpoints).
- **Immersion:** Immersion levels are balanced (mostly 35-55% range).
