## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Typo in Vocabulary Table
- **Location**: Section "The Iotated Four", Table Row 4
- **Original**: "д**я́**к**ю** (dyákuyu)"
- **Problem**: The Cyrillic word is misspelled. It is missing the letter "у". "дякю" is incorrect.
- **Fix**: "д**я́**к**у**ю (dyákuyu)"

### Issue 2: Transliteration choice
- **Location**: Section "The Hard I (И)", Table Row 1
- **Original**: "п**і**ца (píttsa)"
- **Problem**: "píttsa" suggests a geminated (double) "t" sound, which isn't standard in the Ukrainian pronunciation of "піца" (/pˈit͡sa/).
- **Fix**: "п**і**ца (pítsa)"

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| ~55 | д**я́**к**ю** | д**я́**к**у**ю | Typo |

## Verdict

**PASS**

The module is excellent: engaging, pedagogically sound, and culturally rich. The only blocker is a single typo in the word "дякую" in the presentation table which must be fixed before release. Otherwise, it is a perfect introduction to the alphabet.
