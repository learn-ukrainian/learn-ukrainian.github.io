**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Reviewer:** Claude (AI)

## Scores

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Perfectly builds on Module 11 (Things) and Module 03 (Gender). |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Interaction with people (Who do you know/see?) is fundamental. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | Conceptual explanation of "Accusative = Genitive" for animates is excellent. |
| **Language** | 4.5/5 | Very strong, but includes one untaught adjective form (`нового`) in a quiz. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | "The Witcher" pop culture reference for `когось` vs `щось` is brilliant. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Cultural insight on feminine professions (`лікарка`, etc.) is modern and accurate. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | Good mix of drills and sentence ordering. |
| **Overall** | **5/5** | **EXCELLENT** |

## Strengths

-   **Animate Noun Logic**: The explanation that "Historically, genitive was used for the target... so genitive made sense!" provides a "why" for the grammar rule, helping retention.
-   **Feminine Profession Norms**: Explicitly teaching that feminine forms (`лікарка`, `директорка`) are standard in modern Ukraine is culturally progressive and accurate.
-   **Structure**: Clear separation of Masculine (Change) vs Feminine (Standard Change) vs Inanimate (No Change).

## Issues

1.  **Untaught Grammar**: In `quiz: More Complex Sentence Order` (Item 3), the sentence is "Вона знає **нового** студента" (She knows the new student). The adjective ending `-ого` (genitive/accusative masculine adjective) has NOT been taught yet. Adjectives are in M26. This might confuse learners who only know nouns change.
2.  **IPA Precision**: `вчитель` is transcribed `/wtʃɪˈtɛlʲ/`. The initial `в` before a consonant like `ч` usually sounds like `[u]` (non-syllabic) or just `[v]` depending on position, but standard broad IPA usually uses `/v/` or `/u̯/`. `/w/` is acceptable but inconsistent with M11. We will stick to the file's convention if consistent, but noting it for future.
3.  **Missing Vocab**: `продавець` is in the vocab list but the activity prompts use `продавця` without previous introduction in the text body. (Acceptable as practice, but good to note).

## Action Items

1.  **Fix Quiz Item 3**: Change `нового студента` to `цього студента` (this student) or `нашого студента` (our student) if pronouns were taught, OR just `цього` which was used in M05/M10. Actually, genitive pronouns `цього/того` haven't been explicitly taught as a table, but are used in examples. Better to remove the adjective entirely to stay safe: "Вона знає **студента**...".
    - Decision: Change "Вона знає нового студента..." to "Вона знає **цього** студента..." as `цього` appears in the examples text (Line 108: "Вона знає цього студента"). This validates it as "taught by exposure".

## Recommendation

✅ **PASS** (with specific fix)
