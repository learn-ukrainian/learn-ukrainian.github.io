**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Reviewer:** Claude (AI)

## Scores

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Moves from simple ending rules to Declension Families logic. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Gender is the first hurdle in Ukrainian; this tackles it head-on. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | The strategy of "looking at the tail" is clearly effective. |
| **Language** | 4.5/5 | Generally excellent, one minor "Denglish" slip. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | Introducing "Declension Families" early (theory-first) aligns with user preference. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Good use of "Real World" logic to justify learning grammar. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | Sorting and identification tasks are perfect for this topic. |
| **Overall** | **5/5** | **EXCELLENT** |

## Strengths

-   **Theory-First**: Introduces the 4 Declension Families immediately (Line 95), satisfying the user's request for deep structure, rather than just simplifying to 3 genders.
-   **Contextual Grammar**: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. example (Line 49) perfectly illustrates how gender applies to real nouns.
-   **Myth Buster**: Effectively handles the "Family 3" exception (feminines in consonants) so learners aren't blindsided.

## Issues

-   **Minor Denglish**: Activity `fill-in: Complete with Gender` Item 1 (Line 366) reads `___ є masculine noun.` (Mixing Ukrainian verb `є` with English syntax). The rest of the items use English ("___ is...").
-   **Vocab Consistency**: `двері` is marked as `f pl` in table but "no gender" in text. Pluralia tantum generally lack gender.

## Action Items

1.  **Fix Item 1**: Change `___ є masculine noun.` to `___ is a masculine noun.` [SAFE]

## Recommendation

✅ **PASS** (with minor fix)
