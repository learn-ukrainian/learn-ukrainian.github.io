## Strengths

1. **Excellent engagement boxes** - S.T.A.L.K.E.R. reference and folklore corner add genuine value
2. **Clear pattern teaching** - Gender endings are presented as a "code" to crack, making it memorable
3. **Good scaffolding** - Introduces 4 declension families at awareness level without overwhelming
4. **Practical examples** - Mini-dialogues show real usage in home/market contexts
5. **Strong cultural context** - Explains why gender matters and compares to German

## Issues Found

### Fixed

1. **[Language] Line 68: Lowercase sentence start**
   - Before: `**Марко:** а де **вікно**?`
   - After: `**Марко:** А де **вікно**?`
   - Status: ✅ FIXED

### Noted (Not Fixed)

2. **[Scope Creep] Lines 552-603: Off-topic quiz**
   - The quiz "Gender Sentence Structure" teaches word order, not gender
   - This belongs in Module 04 "Це – This Is" which covers sentence structure
   - Status: ⏳ MANUAL - Recommend moving to appropriate module
