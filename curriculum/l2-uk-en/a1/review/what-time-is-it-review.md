## Auto-Fail Checklist Results

- Russianisms: [LIST] "вечером" (Line 183)
- Calques: [CLEAN]
- Grammar scope: [CLEAN]
- Activity errors: [CLEAN]
- Beginner safety: 5/5

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Russism / Grammar Error
- **Location**: Line 183 / Section "Practice" (Conversation: Days of the Week)
- **Original**: "Так, у п'ятницю вечером я вільний."
- **Problem**: "Вечером" is a Russism or incorrect spelling of the instrumental "вечором". The standard Ukrainian adverb is "увечері" (or "ввечері").
- **Fix**: Change to "Так, у п'ятницю ввечері я вільний."

### Issue 2: Clarity of Literal Translation
- **Location**: Line 58 / Section "Half and Quarter Hours"
- **Original**: "in 15 [minutes] second"
- **Problem**: The literal translation for "За п'ятнадцять друга" is slightly confusing English. "In 15 [minutes] [it will be] two" or "15 [minutes] to two" captures the logic better for a learner, though the literal "Za" does mean "In".
- **Fix**: Change literal meaning to "In 15 [minutes] [it is] 2:00" or keep as is but note it's slightly confusing. (Minor, not blocking).

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| 183 | у п'ятницю вечером | у п'ятницю ввечері | Russism/Grammar |

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test: 5/5
- Overwhelmed? [Pass] Structure is very digestible.
- Instructions clear? [Pass] Pattern discovery boxes help immenseley.
- Quick wins? [Pass] Learning the "nature" names of months feels like a win.
- Ukrainian scary? [Pass] The logic of "First hour" vs "One o'clock" is explained well.
- Come back tomorrow? [Pass]

Emotional beats:
- Welcome: "Time is central to daily life..."
- Curiosity: Etymology of days and months tables.
- Quick wins: Easy 1-12 counting revision via hours.
- Encouragement: "You've learned to tell time!"

## Strengths
- **Etymology Tables**: The explanation of Month names (e.g., "Sickle" for August) makes vocabulary memorization much easier and adds cultural depth.
- **Pattern Discovery**: Explicitly showing *why* it is "First hour" (ordinal) vs English "One o'clock" prevents confusion.
- **Activity Volume**: 9 activities provides excellent practice depth.

## Fix Plan to Reach 10/10

### Language: 9/10 → 10/10

**What to fix:**
1.  Line 183: Change "вечером" → "ввечері" — Removes the only Russism found in the text.

### Linguistic Accuracy: 9/10 → 10/10
1.  (Same as above)

## Verification Summary

- Content lines read: 216

## Verdict

**PASS**

The module is excellent, rich, and pedagogically sound. The only flaw is a single word ("вечером") in a dialogue. Once this is corrected to "ввечері", the module is perfect. The content alignment with the plan is strong, and the activities are robust.
