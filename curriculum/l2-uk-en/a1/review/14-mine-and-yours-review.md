**Module:** 14 - Mine and Yours
**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Reviewer:** Claude (AI)

## Scores

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Connects pronouns to gender (M03) perfectly. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | "Whose is this?" is a common daily question. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | Clear separation of Variable (мій) vs Invariant (його) is critical. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | IPA looks good. Distinction between `свій` and `його` explained well. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | LOTR reference (Frodo vs Gollum) is a great memory hook for `моє` vs `його`. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | "Folklore Corner" about *kolomyiky* adds nice depth. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | Good variety, tests gender agreement thoroughly. |
| **Overall** | **5/5** | **PERFECT** |

## Strengths

-   **Variable vs Invariant**: This concept is often confusing (why *його* doesn't change like *мій*?). The module explains it using the "Historical Fossil" (frozen genitive) analogy, which is excellent.
-   **Reflexive `Свій`**: Introducing `свій` early and distinguishing it from `його` avoids a common learner pitfall ("He loves his (someone else's) wife").
-   **Structure**: Clear tables for agreement.

## Issues

*None identified.*

## Action Items

-   None.

## Recommendation

✅ **PASS**
