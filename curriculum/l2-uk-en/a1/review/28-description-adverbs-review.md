## Strengths
1.  **Pragmatics:** Explaining that Ukrainians answer "How are you?" with an adverb (Dobre) whereas English speakers often use adjectives is a key functional insight.
2.  **Frequency Scale:** The visual scale from "Always" to "Never" is excellent for learning.
3.  **Irregulars:** Covering "Dobre" (from Horoshyy/Dobryy) immediately prevents errors.

## Issues
*None.*

## Recommendation
✅ PASS
