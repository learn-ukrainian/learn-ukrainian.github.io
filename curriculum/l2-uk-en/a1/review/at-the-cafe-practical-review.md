## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Gender Agreement Mismatch
- **Location**: Line 47 (Presentation Table)
- **Original**: `| **Гарячий чи холодний?** | /ɦɑˈrʲɑt͡ʃɪj t͡ʃɪ xɔˈlɔdnɪj/ | Hot or cold? |`
- **Problem**: The preceding line is "**Яку каву ви хочете?**". "Кава" is feminine. The follow-up question uses masculine adjectives, creating a grammatical mismatch in context.
- **Fix**: Change to `| **Гаряча чи холодна?** | /ɦɑˈrʲɑt͡ʃɑ t͡ʃɪ xɔˈlɔdnɑ/ | Hot or cold? |` to agree with "кава".

### Issue 2: Duplicate Table Row
- **Location**: Lines 49-51
- **Original**:
    | **Гарячий чи холодний?** | /ɦɑˈrʲɑt͡ʃɪj t͡ʃɪ xɔˈlɔdnɪj/ | Hot or cold? |

  | **Гарячий чи холодний?** | /ɦɑˈrʲɑt͡ʃɪj t͡ʃɪ xɔˈlɔdnɪj/ | Hot or cold? |
  - **Problem**: The row is duplicated outside the table structure, creating a formatting error.
- **Fix**: Remove the duplicate line 51.

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |

## Beginner Safety Audit

- Instructions clear? [Pass] Yes.
- Quick wins? [Pass] "Ordering formula" is a quick win.

## Strengths

- **Practicality**: The distinction between "Я буду..." and literal translation is handled perfectly for A1.
- **Activity Design**: The "Menu Detective" true/false activity effectively tests logic and vocabulary simultaneously.

## Verdict

**PASS**

The module is excellent—engaging, culturally rich, and practically useful. The only issues are a minor gender agreement slip in the presentation table and a formatting glitch (duplicate line). Once these two small edits are made, it is perfect.
