**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Reviewer:** Claude (AI)

## Scores

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Logical building on previous gender/verb knowledge. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | "Traveling" scenario is highly relevant. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | Focuses *only* on inanimate objects, which is smart scaffolding. |
| **Language** | 4.5/5 | High quality, minor typo in example. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | Strong "Contrast" section (Nominative vs Accusative). |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | S.T.A.L.K.E.R. reference is perfect for this demographic. |
| **Activities** | 4.5/5 | Vocabulary table IPA for 'показувати' is slightly off standard stress marking. |
| **Overall** | **5/5** | **EXCELLENT** |

## Strengths

-   **Scaffolding**: Isolating *inanimate* accusative (hardly any change except -a -> -u) builds confidence before the complex animate rules.
-   **Context**: Post office/Airport contexts are where this grammar matters most.
-   **S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Moment**: Explaining `аномалію` serves as a great "hook" for gamers.

## Issues

1.  **Typo**: In the examples list (Line 90), it says `Ми берем валізу` (We take...). The correct standard form is **беремо** (Class I). `берем` is colloquial/spoken, but beginners should learn the standard `беремо` first.
2.  **IPA Stress**: In the vocab table (Line 662), `показувати` is transcribed as `/pokɑˈzuvɑtɪ/` (stress on 'zu'). Standard stress is often on the second syllable `/poˈkɑzuvɑtɪ/` (po-KA-zu-va-ty), though dynamic stress exists, teaching the standard layout is safer.

## Action Items

1.  **Fix Verb Form**: Change `берем` to **беремо** in Line 90. [SAFE]
2.  **Adjust IPA**: Change `/pokɑˈzuvɑtɪ/` to `/poˈkɑzuvɑtɪ/`. [SAFE]

## Recommendation

✅ **PASS** (with specific fixes)
