**Module:** 05 - My World: Objects
**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Reviewer:** Claude (AI)

## Scores

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Demonstratives build perfectly on Gender (M03). |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Household vocabulary is heavily requested by learners. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | Clear scaffolding of Near vs Far. |
| **Language** | 4.5/5 | High quality, but one grammar error in activities. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | Excellent "Cultural Insight" on housing types. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | The "Witcher" and "Khrushchyovky" references add depth. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | Good drill density. |
| **Overall** | **5/5** | **EXCELLENT** |

## Strengths

-   **Vocabulary**: 40 words is a lot, but they are grouped logically (Kitchen, Room, etc.).
-   **Context**: Explaining *why* appliance genders are what they are (-ка suffix) is very helpful.
-   **Scaffolding**: Explicitly linking back to M03 genders.

## Issues

-   **Grammar Error**: Activity `fill-in: Complete the Dialogue`, Item 8 uses **"Що те на стіні?"** to mean "What is that?". In Ukrainian, **"те"** is an adjective/demonstrative (that [neuter thing]), not a distinct pronoun for "that" (which is **"то"**, not taught yet). The phrase "Що те...?" sounds unnatural.
    -   Proposed Fix: Change the question to **"Де та картина?"** (Where is that painting?), which correctly tests the Feminine Far demonstrative **"Та"**, fitting the module's objectives.

## Action Items

1.  **Fix Activity Item 8**: Replace the unnatural "Що те?" question with a standard demonstrative Question: `— Де ___ картина? — Вона на стіні.` (Answer: **Та**). [SAFE]

## Recommendation

✅ **PASS** (with specific fix)
