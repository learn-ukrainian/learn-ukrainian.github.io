## Module 05: My World: Objects

**Scores:** Coherence 5/5 | Relevance 5/5 | Educational 5/5 | Language 5/5 | Pedagogy 5/5 | Immersion 5/5 | Activities 5/5 | **Overall 5/5**
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### Strengths
- Clear grid tables for "This" (Near) vs "That" (Far).
- "Gender Agreement Matters" section reinforces Module 03 concepts well.
- "Kitchen" and "Living Room" contexts provide practical application.
- High activity density (8 activities).

### Issues
- **Activity Length (Minor):** The `group-sort` activity has 31 items total. This is great for practice but might be visually long. No action needed unless UI complains.

### Recommendation
✅ PASS
