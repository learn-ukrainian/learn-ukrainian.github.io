**Reviewer:** Claude (AI)

## Scores

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Review of earlier food words (M03) + new verbs. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | "Ordering food" is a top survival skill. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | Explains *concepts* like "Svyata Vecherya" (implied) and hospitality. |
| **Language** | 4.5/5 | Generally great explanation of usage. Small grammar fix needed. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | Good recycling of previous vocabulary. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | "Borscht as resistance" and "Holodomor" context is powerful. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | Very thorough covering of all categories. |
| **Overall** | **5/5** | **EXCELLENT** |

## Strengths

-   **Context**: The module doesn't just list food; it explains *when* and *how* it's eaten (Breakfast vs Lunch vs Dinner).
-   **Recycling**: It effectively reuses the food vocabulary introduced in Module 03 (Gender) and activates it with verbs.
-   **Directness**: The "Ordering" dialogue is practical and culturally accurate.

## Issues

1.  **Grammar Error**: Line 136 says `Ранку я п'ю чай...` (Of the morning I drink tea). This is unnatural. Standard Ukrainian is **Вранці** (In the morning) or **Щоранку** (Every morning).
2.  **Vocabulary Omissions**: Key new words are missing from the Vocabulary Table:
    -   **борщ** (borscht) - central to the lesson!
    -   **кава** (coffee) - essential drink.
    -   **суп** (soup)
    -   **банан** (banana)
    -   (Note: *хліб, вода, чай* were in M03, so their exclusion is correct).
3.  **IPA Stress**: **їжа** is transcribed as `/jiˈʒɑ/` (stress on last syllable), but standard stress is usually on the first syllable `/ˈjiʒɑ/`.

## Action Items

1.  **Fix Line 136**: Change `Ранку` to **Вранці**. [SAFE]
2.  **Update Vocab Table**: Add entries for `борщ`, `кава`, `суп`, `банан`. [SAFE]
3.  **Fix IPA**: Adjust `їжа` to `/ˈjiʒɑ/`. [SAFE]

## Recommendation

✅ **PASS** (with specific fixes)
