# Lesson Content

## warm-up
**The Engine of the Sentence: Bringing Words to Life**

So far, you have learned to label your world. You can point and say "This is a table" or "That is a lamp." You have the nouns (the "things") and the adjectives (the "colors"). But your world is still a still-life painting. Nothing moves. Nothing happens.

Today, that changes. Today, we turn on the engine.

We are introducing **Verbs** (Дієслова). Verbs are the heartbeat of the Ukrainian sentence. They tell us who is doing what. They allow you to say "I read," "We work," "You know."

In English, verbs are quite lazy. "I read, You read, We read, They read." The word "read" barely changes. But in Ukrainian, verbs are alive. They change their ending to match the person doing the action. This is called **conjugation**.

Think of the verb as a chameleon that changes color depending on who it is sitting next to.
- If **I** do it, the verb wears one ending.
- If **You** do it, the verb wears another.

This might sound complex, but it follows a beautiful, rhythm pattern. Once you hear the rhythm, you will feel it.

> 💡 **Did You Know? The "You" Distinction**
> Just like in French or German, Ukrainian has two ways to say "You":
> 1. **Ти** (Informal singular): Used for friends, family, children, and God.
> 2. **Ви** (Formal/Plural): Used for strangers, elders, authority figures, OR when addressing a group of people.
> In our conjugation tables, we will always show both.

## presentation

### Class I Verbs: The "-АТИ" Family

Ukrainian verbs are grouped into two main "families" (conjugations) based on how they sound. Today we meet the biggest and friendliest family: **Class I**.

These verbs generally end in **-АТИ** or **-ЯТИ** in their dictionary form (the Infinitive).
Example: **Читати** (To read).

To use this verb, we first chop off the **-ти** to find the "stem" (the root), and then we add our new "person" endings.

**Stem:** Чита-

| Person | Pronoun | Ending | Verb Form | English | Audio |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| I | **Я** | **-ю** | чита**ю** | I read | [🔊](audio_chytayu) |
| You (sg) | **Ти** | **-єш** | чита**єш** | You read | [🔊](audio_chytayesh) |
| He/She/It | **Він/Вона** | **-є** | чита**є** | He/she reads | [🔊](audio_chytaye) |
| We | **Ми** | **-ємо** | чита**ємо** | We read | [🔊](audio_chytayemo) |
| You (pl) | **Ви** | **-єте** | чита**єте** | You read | [🔊](audio_chytayete) |
| They | **Вони** | **-ють** | чита**ють** | They read | [🔊](audio_chytayut) |

**The Rhythm of Class I:**
Listen to the vowels: -Ю, -ЄШ, -Є, -ЄМО, -ЄТЕ, -ЮТЬ.
It is bright and open. It flows.

### The "Hidden" Subject: The Power of Endings
You might notice something interesting. Since every pronoun has a unique ending, the ending *itself* tells you who is speaking.
- **Читаю** can *only* mean "I read."
- **Читаємо** can *only* mean "We read."

In poetic or casual Ukrainian, you can sometimes drop the pronoun entirely because the verb does all the work!
> **Я знаю** (I know) $\rightarrow$ **Знаю** (I know).

This is why we call them "Living Verbs." They carry the identity of the speaker inside them.

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: No "Is" in "Reads"**
> English speakers often want to translate "He is reading" as "Він є читає." **Don't do it!**
> "To be" (є) is almost never used as a helper verb in the present tense.
> - **Wrong:** Він є читає.
> - **Right:** Він читає.
> The Ukrainian present tense covers both "Basic" (he reads) and "Continuous" (he is reading) aspects.


### Verbs in Action: A Day in the Life

Let's see how these verbs paint a picture of daily life.

**Scenario 1: At the University**
- **Я читаю.** (I am reading / I read.)
- **Ми слухаємо.** (We are listening.)
- **Ви питаєте.** (You are asking.)
- **Він відповідає.** (He is answering.)

Notice that there is no "am" or "is" or "are" here. "Я читаю" means both "I read" AND "I am reading." The context tells you which one it is.


**Scenario 2: Relaxing at Home**
The evening is quiet.
- **Олена відпочиває.** (Olena is resting.)
- **Ми граємо.** (We are playing.)
- **Вони співають.** (They are singing.)
- **Ти снідаєш?** (Are you having breakfast? - *Wait, at night? Maybe a late snack!*)

**Scenario 3: The Common Mistake**
Imagine a student acts confused.
- Teacher: **Ти розумієш?** (Do you understand?)
- Student: **Я не розумію.** (I don't understand.)
- Teacher: **Хто знає?** (Who knows?)
- Other Student: **Я знаю!** (I know!)

> 🎭 **Culture Corner: The Art of "Questioning"**
> In Ukrainian, you don't need a helper word like "Do" or "Does" to ask a question. You simply change your intonation!
> - Statement: **Ти знаєш.** (You know.) ↘
> - Question: **Ти знаєш?** (Do you know?) ↗
> Later we will add the little word **"чи"** to make formal Yes/No questions, but nearly 90% of the time in daily life, intonation is King.
>
> **Try it:**
> Say "Ти читаєш" like a robot. (Statement)
> Now say "Ти читаєш" like you are surprised. (Question)
> That's it! You're speaking Ukrainian.


### Common Class I Verbs
Here are the verbs you will use to build your first action sentences.

**Communication:**
- **Говорити** is Class II (coming later). For now, we use:
- **Питати** (To ask)
- **Відповідати** (To answer)
- **Співати** (To sing) (Ukrainians love to sing!)

**Mental Actions:**
- **Знати** (To know) - *Very useful! "Я не знаю" (I don't know).*
- **Думати** (To think)
- **Розуміти** (To understand)
- **Мріяти** (To dream/daydream)

**Daily Routine:**
- **Снідати** (To have breakfast)
- **Обідати** (To have lunch)
- **Вечеряти** (To have dinner)
- **Гуляти** (To walk/stroll) - *A huge part of Ukrainian social culture. "To go for a walk" is how friends hang out.*

## practice

Let's tune the engine.

**Pattern Drill: The "You" and "I" Exchange**
Typical conversation involves asking "Do you...?" and answering "I...".
- **Question:** Ти чита**єш**? (Do you read?)
- **Answer:** Так, я чита**ю**. (Yes, I read.)

- **Question:** Ти зна**єш**? (Do you know?)
- **Answer:** Ні, я не зна**ю**. (No, I don't know.)
*(Note: "Не" goes BEFORE the verb for negation)*

- **Question:** Ви працю**єте**? (Do you (pl/formal) work?)
- **Answer:** Так, ми працю**ємо**. (Yes, we work.)

## production

Look at the people around you (or imagine them). Describe what they are doing using our new verbs.

1.  **(Self):** Я **думаю**. (I am thinking.)
2.  **(Friend):** Ти **слухаєш**. (You are listening.)
3.  **(Group):** Ми **починаємо**. (We are starting.)
4.  **(Others):** Вони **чекають**. (They are waiting.)

Now, combine it with a noun you know:
- **Я читаю книгу.** (I am reading a book.) [Wait! "Книга" changes to "Книгу" because it's an object? Yes! That's the Accusative case, coming in Module 11. For now, just listen to the sound.]

# Summary

You have ignited the engine! Language is no longer just labels on a shelf; it is action, movement, and life.
1.  **Class I Verbs** are your diverse workforce. They end in **-АТИ** or **-ЯТИ**.
2.  **The Pattern:** You drop the **-ти** and match the ending to the pronoun:
    - **Я -ю**
    - **Ти -єш**
    - **Він -є**
    - **Ми -ємо**
    - **Ви -єте**
    - **Вони -ють**
3.  **No "Is/Are":** The verb contains the "to be" meaning within it. "Я читаю" = "I am reading."

Next, we will give you the tools to seek information. You can state facts ("I read"), but soon you will learn to ask deep questions ("What do you read?").
