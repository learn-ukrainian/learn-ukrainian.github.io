# The Living Verb I

До цього моменту ми говорили: це книга, то стіл. (This is a book. That is a table.). Але життя — це рух, дія! Час навчитися: я читаю, ти пишеш, ми працюємо.

Up until now, we've talked about what things **are** (Це книга. То стіл.). But life is movement, action! It's time to learn how to talk about what we **do**.

Today you unlock your first set of Ukrainian action verbs — the **First Conjugation (-ати verbs)**. These are verbs ending in **-ати** or **-яти**, and they're everywhere in daily life: читати (to read), писати (to write), працювати (to work), гуляти (to walk), грати (to play).

Mastering this pattern means you can suddenly talk about what you're doing **right now**. No more frozen sentences — your Ukrainian comes alive.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian verb conjugations are incredibly logical. Once you learn the First Conjugation pattern (this module), you've unlocked hundreds of verbs! They all follow the same rules, so if you know **читати → читаю**, you automatically know **працювати → працюю** and **гуляти → гуляю**. It's like getting a master key to Ukrainian action.

## Warm-up

Think about your typical day. You wake up. You eat breakfast. You read. You work. You walk. You play. Every single one of these actions uses an **-ати verb** in Ukrainian.

**Питання:** You read. You work. You walk. Ready to say it in Ukrainian?

---

## Presentation

### The Pattern: -ати → -аю, -аєш, -ає...

The **First Conjugation** (sometimes called the **е-conjugation**) includes verbs whose infinitive (dictionary form) ends in **-ати** or **-яти**.

> [!tip] **Grammar Secret: Aspect**
>
> All the verbs in this module are **imperfective** (недоконаний вид). This means they describe actions that are **ongoing, repeated, or habitual**.
>
> - **Я читаю** = I am reading (right now) OR I read (every day).
>
> In A2, you will learn «perfective» verbs for one-time completed actions (like «I finished reading»). For now, focus on these ongoing actions!

To conjugate them in the present tense, we:

1. Drop the **-ти** ending
2. Add personal endings based on **who** is doing the action

Let's take **читати** (chytaty — to read) as our example:

| Person   | Ukrainian    | Conjugation  | English                  |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| я        | я читаю      | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑju/   | I read                   |
| ти       | ти читаєш    | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑjeʃ/  | you read (informal)      |
| він/вона | він читає    | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑje/   | he/she reads             |
| ми       | ми читаємо   | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑjemɔ/ | we read                  |
| ви       | ви читаєте   | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑjete/ | you read (formal/plural) |
| вони     | вони читають | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑjutʲ/ | they read                |

**Key insight:** The stem is **чита-**. The endings tell you **who**: -ю (I), -єш (you), -є (he/she), -ємо (we), -єте (you all), -ють (they).

> 🎯 **Fun Fact**
>
> In Ukrainian, you often **drop the pronoun** because the verb ending already tells you who's doing the action! So instead of «Я читаю», Ukrainians often just say «Читаю» — the ending **-ю** makes it clear it's «I». This makes Ukrainian sound efficient and rhythmic.

### More Examples: The First Conjugation Family

Most First Conjugation verbs are very regular. Let's look at two common subgroups:

#### 1. Regular -ати/-яти Verbs

These verbs keep their stem exactly as it appears in the infinitive (minus -ти).

| Infinitive | Stem    | я form   | English         |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | --------------- |
| гуляти     | гуля-   | гуляю    | to walk, stroll |
| грати      | гра-    | граю     | to play         |
| співати    | співа-  | співаю   | to sing         |
| думати     | дума-   | думаю    | to think        |
| слухати    | слуха-  | слухаю   | to listen       |
| розуміти   | розумі- | розумію  | to understand   |

#### 2. The працювати Type (-ва- Dropping Rule)

Many Ukrainian verbs end in **-ювати** or **-увати**. These are often new words or loanwords.

**The Rule:** In the present tense, the **-ва-** syllable drops out and is replaced by **-ю-** (or -у-).

This is why **працювати** becomes **працюю** (not «працюваю»).

**Memorize this pattern:**
- Infinitive: ...-ювати
- Present: ...-юю, -юєш, -ює

| Infinitive | Stem Drop | Conjugation (Я) | English |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **працювати** | працю~~ва~~- | **працюю** | to work |
| **танцювати** | танцю~~ва~~- | **танцюю** | to dance |
| **подорожувати** | подорожу~~ва~~- | **подорожую** | to travel |
| **малювати** | малю~~ва~~- | **малюю** | to paint/draw |

> 🧠 **Memory Trick**
>
> Imagine the **-ва-** is shy. It runs away when the action happens NOW (present tense)!
> But don't worry—it comes back in the past tense (as you'll see in M21).

> [!important] **Consonant Mutation**
> Some verbs like **писати** (to write) change their final consonant: **писати** → **пишу** (not «писаю»). Don't worry about the rules yet; just memorize the «я пишу» form for now!

**Let's see them in action:**

- Я **пишу** лист. (I write a letter.) — /ˈpɪʃu lɪst/
- Ти **працюєш** тут? (Do you work here?) — /prɑˈt͡sʲujeʃ tut/
- Вона **гуляє** в парку. (She strolls in the park.) — /ɦuˈlʲɑje ʋ ˈparku/
- Ми **граємо**. (We play.) — /ˈɦrɑjemɔ/
- Ви **співаєте**. (You sing.) — /spiˈʋɑjete/
- Вони **думають**. (They think.) — /ˈdumɑjutʲ/
- Я **розумію** українську. (I understand Ukrainian.) — /rozuˈmiju ukrɑˈjinʲsʲku/
- Ти **слухаєш** музику. (You listen to music.) — /ˈsluxɑjeʃ ˈmuzɪku/

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment**
>
> In the Ukrainian dub of **Harry Potter**, when Hermione says «I'm reading!», she uses the verb **читаю** (chytayu). Just one word! In English, you need two words («I'm reading»), but Ukrainian packs both the subject and the continuous action into a single conjugated verb. Economy and elegance combined.

### Daily Life Verbs: -ати in Real Contexts

Here's how these verbs show up in real Ukrainian life:

**Ранок (Morning):**

- Я **снідаю**. (I have breakfast.) — /sniˈdɑju/
- Ти **починаєш** роботу. (You start work.) — /pɔt͡ʃɪˈnɑjeʃ rɔˈbɔtu/

**День (Day):**

- Вона **працює**. (She works.) — /prɑˈt͡sʲuje/
- Ми **обідаємо**. (We have lunch.) — /ɔbiˈdɑjemɔ/

**Вечір (Evening):**

- Ви **вечеряєте** вдома? (Do you have dinner at home?) — /ʋeˈt͡ʃerʲɑjete ˈʋdɔmɑ/
- Вони **відпочивають**. (They rest.) — /ʋidpɔˈt͡ʃɪʋɑjutʲ/

**Вільний час (Free Time):**

- Я **читаю** книгу. (I read a book.) — /t͡ʃɪˈtɑju ˈknɪɦu/
- Ти **граєш**. (You play.) — /ˈɦrɑjeʃ/
- Він **малює** картину. (He paints a picture.) — /mɑˈlʲuje kɑrˈtɪnu/
- Вона **співає**. (She sings.) — /spiˈʋɑje/

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> Walk into any Ukrainian café in Lviv and you might hear: «Ти **працюєш** сьогодні?» (Are you working today?). The barista asks this to decide if they'll pour you a strong espresso or a relaxing cappuccino. One verb — працюєш — and they know your whole vibe.

## Practice

### Mini-Dialogue 1: У парку (In the park)

**Setting:** Two friends meet at a park.

— Привіт! Ти **читаєш**? (Hi! Are you reading?)
— Так, **читаю** книгу. А ти? (Yes, I'm reading a book. And you?)
— Я **чекаю** друга. Він **працює** тут. (I'm waiting for a friend. He works here.)
— Де? (Where?)
— Тут. Він **знає** цей парк добре! (Here. He knows this park well!)

**Translation:**
— Hi! Are you reading?
— Yes, I'm reading a book. And you?
— I'm waiting for a friend. He works here.
— Where?
— Here, in the park. He knows this park well!

### Mini-Dialogue 2: Вдома (At home)

**Setting:** Friends talk at home.

— Ти **працюєш** сьогодні? (Do you work today?)
— Ні, я **відпочиваю**. **Слухаю** музику. (No, I rest. I listen to music.)
— А я **гуляю** в парку! (And I walk in the park!)
— Я теж **люблю** парк. (I also love the park.)

**Translation:**
— Do you work today?
— No, I rest. I listen to music.
— And I walk to the park!
— I also love the park.

> ⚡ **Pro Tip**
>
> The verb **робити** (to do/make) is tricky! Ukrainians actually use this verb in the **Second Conjugation**. We learn that in Module 08. For now, use **читаю, граю, гуляю** — those are pure First Conjugation gold.

## Cultural Insight

### Verbs and Ukrainian Soul

Ukrainians love action verbs. They reflect the culture's emphasis on **doing**, not just being. People in Ukraine ask: «Ти робиш?» (Do you work?), «Ти читаєш?» (Do you read?).

Life is measured in verbs. What you **do** defines who you are.

And here's the beautiful part: Ukrainian verbs carry **musicality**. Listen to the rhythm:

- Я **чи-та-ю**, ти **чи-та-єш**, він **чи-та-є**...

The vowels (а, є, ю) flow like a melody. The consonants (т, в, л) give structure. This is why Ukrainian poetry and songs are so rich — the verbs themselves sing.

> 🎭 **Folklore Corner**
>
> In Ukrainian folk songs (пісні), **First Conjugation** verbs appear constantly because they describe daily life: **співати** (to sing), **танцювати** (to dance), **гуляти** (to stroll). The folk song «Ой ходила дівчина бережком» (A girl walked by the riverbank), collected in the songbook *Пісні маминого серця* (2006), uses First Conjugation verbs like **гуляє** in its verses. You're learning the very verb patterns that built Ukrainian folk expression.

### Reading: Мій день (My Day)

Я **снідаю**. (I have breakfast.)
Потім я **працюю**. (Then I work.)
Я **обідаю**. (I have lunch.)
Я **гуляю** в парку. (I walk in the park.)
Я **читаю** книгу. (I read a book.)
Я **слухаю** музику. (I listen to music.)
Я **думаю**. (I think.)

**Translation:**
I have breakfast. Then I work. I have lunch. I walk to the park. I read a book. I listen to music. I think.
