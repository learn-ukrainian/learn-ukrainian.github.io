## Grammar

## The Compound Future Tense

> [!observe] Pattern Discovery
>
> Look at these sentences:
> - Я **буду читати**. (I will read.)
> - Вона **буде працювати**. (She will work.)
> - Ми **будемо вивчати** українську. (We will study Ukrainian.)
>
> The future = буду/будеш/буде... + infinitive (-ти form)

Ukrainian uses **буду** (future of "to be") + infinitive to form the compound future. This works with imperfective verbs.

> 💡 **Future in Song**
>
> Many Ukrainian songs use the future tense to express hopes and dreams. The famous song "Все буде добре" (Everything will be fine) became an anthem of optimism during difficult times.

> 🌍 **Making Appointments**
>
> When scheduling in Ukrainian:
> - "Я буду о третій" = I'll be there at three
> - "Зателефоную пізніше" = I'll call later
> - "Побачимось завтра!" = See you tomorrow!

> 💡 **Two Futures**
>
> Ukrainian actually has two ways to express future! The compound future (буду + infinitive) we learned today is for ongoing/repeated actions. For single completed actions, Ukrainian uses the perfective future (which looks like present tense of perfective verbs). You'll master both as you progress!
