# Questions & Negation

## Warm-up

You've learned to make statements in Ukrainian: «Я читаю книгу» (I read a book). But conversations aren't just statements - they're questions and answers, agreements and disagreements!

In English, asking «Do you read?» requires changing word order or adding «do/does». Ukrainian is simpler - you just add the little word **чи** at the beginning! And saying «no»? Just put **не** before the verb.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian is very flexible with questions. You can ask «Чи ти читаєш?» (formal) or just «Ти читаєш?» (casual, with rising intonation). Both work! Context and tone tell you it's a question.

## Presentation

### Yes/No Questions with Чи

The simplest way to turn any statement into a yes/no question is to add **чи** at the beginning:

| Statement      | Question (with чи) |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Ти читаєш.     | **Чи** ти читаєш?  |
| You read.      | Do you read?       |
| Вона працює.   | **Чи** вона працює? |
| She works.     | Does she work?     |
| Ми знаємо.     | **Чи** ми знаємо?  |
| We know.       | Do we know?        |

**The pattern:** Чи + subject + verb?

In casual speech, Ukrainians often skip **чи** and just use rising intonation:

- Ти читаєш? ↗ (You read? = Do you read?)

**Answering:**

- **Так** (Tak) = Yes
- **Ні** (Ni) = No

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment**
>
> In the Ukrainian dub of Marvel's Avengers, when someone asks «Ти читаєш?» (Do you read this?), they skip **чи** because it's action-packed! But in formal meetings, they use «Чи ви читаєте?» (Do you [formal] read?). Same question, different register!

**Mini-Dialogue 1: At a Café**

— Чи ти хочеш каву? (Chy ty khochesh kavu?)
— Так, дякую! (Tak, dyakuyu!)
— Чи ти знаєш, де туалет? (Chy ty znayesh, de tualet?)
— Ні, не знаю. (Ni, ne znayu.)

### Question Words

Ukrainian has question words (like English «what, who, where») that replace the unknown part of the sentence:

| Ukrainian    | IPA        | English          | Example                                |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **що**       | /ʃt͡ʃɔ/     | what             | Що ти читаєш? (What do you read?)      |
| **хто**      | /xtɔ/      | who              | Хто працює? (Who works?)               |
| **де**       | /dɛ/       | where (location) | Де ти? (Where are you?)                |
| **куди**     | /ˈkudɪ/    | where (to)       | Куди ти йдеш? (Where are you going?)   |
| **звідки**   | /ˈzʋidkɪ/  | where from       | Звідки ти? (Where are you from?)       |
| **коли**     | /kɔˈlɪ/    | when             | Коли ти працюєш? (When do you work?)   |
| **чому**     | /t͡ʃɔˈmu/   | why              | Чому ти читаєш? (Why do you read?)     |
| **як**       | /jɑk/      | how              | Як ти? (How are you?)                  |
| **скільки**  | /ˈskilʲkɪ/ | how much/many    | Скільки це коштує? (How much is this?) |

**Pattern:** Question word + verb + rest of sentence

Notice: Unlike English, you don't need «do/does» - the question word itself signals it's a question!

> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** «Question words must come first in Ukrainian.»
> **Fact:** While they usually do, Ukrainians often move them for emphasis! «Ти куди йдеш?» (You where going? = Where exactly are you going?) feels more urgent than «Куди ти йдеш?»

**Mini-Dialogue 2: Getting to Know Someone**

— Як тебе звуть? (Yak tebe zvut?) — What's your name?
— Мене звуть Марко. (Mene zvut Marko.) — My name is Marko.
— Звідки ти? (Zvidky ty?) — Where are you from?
— Я з Києва. А ти? (Ya z Kyyeva. A ty?) — I'm from Kyiv. And you?
— Я з Америки. (Ya z Ameryky.) — I'm from America.

### Negation with Не

To make a verb negative, just put **не** (ne) before it. Simple!

| Positive      | Negative          |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Я читаю.      | Я **не** читаю.   |
| I read.       | I don't read.     |
| Вона працює.  | Вона **не** працює. |
| She works.    | She doesn't work. |
| Ми знаємо.    | Ми **не** знаємо.  |
| We know.      | We don't know.    |

**Key difference from English:** In Ukrainian, you don't need «don't/doesn't/didn't» - just **не + verb**!

**Common negative constructions:**

- Я не розумію. = I don't understand.
- Я не знаю. = I don't know.
- Це не правда. = That's not true.

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> Ukrainians are very direct with negation. If you ask «Чи ти знаєш?», a simple «Ні, не знаю» is perfectly polite. No need to soften it with «I'm afraid I don't...» like in English! You can also say «На жаль, не знаю» (Unfortunately, I don't know) if you want to be extra polite.

**Negative questions:**

You can combine **чи** and **не** to ask negative questions — just like English «Don't you...?»:

- Чи ти не читаєш? = Don't you read?
- Чи вона не працює? = Doesn't she work?

This structure expresses mild surprise that something is not the case.

**Mini-Dialogue 3: Misunderstandings**

— Чи ти говориш англійською?
— Так, говорю. А ти?
— Ні, я не говорю англійською. Я говорю українською.
— Добре! Ми говоримо українською!

### Frequency Adverbs

When talking about how often you do things, Ukrainian uses these adverbs:

| Adverb        | IPA          | English   | Example                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **завжди**    | /ˈzɑʋʒdɪ/    | always    | Я завжди читаю. (I always read.)                             |
| **часто**     | /ˈt͡ʃɑstɔ/    | often     | Вона часто працює. (She often works.)                        |
| **іноді**     | /iˈnɔdi/     | sometimes | Ми іноді говоримо. (We sometimes talk.)                      |
| **рідко**     | /ˈridkɔ/     | rarely    | Він рідко пише. (He rarely writes.)                          |
| **ніколи**    | /nʲiˈkɔlɪ/   | never     | Я ніколи не читаю це. (I never read this.)                   |
| **зазвичай**  | /zɑzʋɪˈt͡ʃɑj/ | usually   | Я зазвичай читаю вдома. (I usually read at home.)            |

**Important:** **Ніколи** (never) is already negative, but Ukrainian uses **double negation** - you still add **не**!

- Я **ніколи не** читаю це. (I never read this.) ✅
- Я ніколи читаю це. ❌ (Wrong - missing не!)

This is called **double negation** and it's mandatory in Ukrainian.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian loves double negation! «Я нічого не знаю» (I nothing don't know = I don't know anything) feels natural to Ukrainians. This pattern comes from older Slavic languages and makes negation extra clear. So remember: «ніколи» needs «не», «нічого» needs «не», «ніхто» needs «не»!

## Practice

Now you know:

- ✅ How to ask yes/no questions with **чи**
- ✅ Question words (що, хто, де, куди, коли, чому, як, скільки)
- ✅ How to say no with **не**
- ✅ Frequency adverbs (завжди, часто, іноді, рідко, ніколи, зазвичай)

**Try these yourself** — form the Ukrainian question, then check:

1. Ask: «Do you work?» → Чи ти працюєш?
2. Ask: «Where are you from?» → Звідки ти?
3. Say: «I don't understand.» → Я не розумію.

Got them? Great — now let's put it all together!

## Production

**Task: Create a conversation**

Imagine you meet someone new at a café in Lviv. Use what you learned to:

1. Ask their name (Як тебе звуть?)
2. Ask where they're from (Звідки ти?)
3. Ask if they read Ukrainian (Чи ти читаєш українською?)
4. Say something you don't do (Я не...)
5. Say something you always do (Я завжди...)

**Model Answer:**

— Привіт! Як тебе звуть? (Hi! What's your name?)
— Мене звуть Оля. А тебе? (My name is Olya. And yours?)
— Марко. Звідки ти? (Marko. Where are you from?)
— Я зі Львова. А ти? (I'm from Lviv. And you?)
— Я з Києва. Чи ти читаєш українською? (I'm from Kyiv. Do you read in Ukrainian?)
— Так! Я завжди читаю українською. А ти? (Yes! I always read in Ukrainian. And you?)
— Я часто читаю, але іноді не розумію. (I often read, but sometimes I don't understand.)
— Нічого! Це нормально. (No problem! That's normal.)

## Cultural Insight

**Ukrainian Directness with Questions**

Ukrainians are generally more direct than English speakers when asking questions. Simple questions are common even with new acquaintances - especially from older generations.

This isn't rude - it's genuine interest! Ukrainians value honesty and directness in conversation.

**Common Questions You'll Hear:**

- Звідки ти? (Where are you from?)
- Що ти робиш? (What do you do?)
- Чому ти вивчаєш українську? (Why do you study Ukrainian?)
- Чи ти хочеш каву? (Do you want coffee?)

> 🎭 **Culture Corner**
>
> When Ukrainians ask «Як справи?» (How are things?), they actually want to know! Unlike the English «How are you?» (often just a greeting), Ukrainians expect a real answer. Feel free to say «Не дуже добре» (Not so great) - they'll ask why and genuinely care.
