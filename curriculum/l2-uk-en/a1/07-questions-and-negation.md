# Lesson Content

## warm-up
**The Power of Curiosity**

You can now name objects ("Це стіл") and describe actions ("Я читаю"). But you are still trapped in your own bubble. You can state facts, but you cannot ask for information. You cannot connect.

To truly interact, you need two keys:
1.  **The Question:** To invite someone else into the conversation.
2.  **The Negation:** To define boundaries and correct misunderstandings.

Today, we hand you these keys. We will turn you from a narrator into an interviewer. You will learn to ask "Who?" "Where?" and "Why?"—the three favorite words of every Ukrainian grandmother!


### The Polite Stranger vs. The Friend

Imagine two scenes.
**Scene 1:** You meet a stranger. You want to ask if they know English.
- **You:** "Чи ви знаєте англійську?" (Do you know English?) -> *Polite, clear, structured.*

**Scene 2:** You are with a friend. You are shocked they don't know a meme.
- **You:** "Ти не знаєш?!" (You don't know?!) -> *Emotional, direct, intonation-driven.*

> 💡 **Did You Know? The "Thinking" Sound**
> When English speakers think, they say "Ummm..."
> When Ukrainian speakers think, they often say "Еммм..." (Emmm...) or stretch the last vowel of the previous word.
> "Я думаюююю..." (I am thinking...)

### The Melody of a Question

Ukrainian is very musical. The difference between a statement and a question is often just the melody.
- **Statement:** The voice goes down at the end, like a heavy stone dropping. $\searrow$
- **Question:** The voice jumps UP on the most important word, then hangs in the air. $\nearrow$

> 🔗 **Language Link: The Missing "Do"**
> In English, you need "helpers" like "Do" or "Does" or "Is".
> - "Do you read?"
> - "Is he here?"
> Ukrainian has NO helpers. The specific verb and the context do all the heavy lifting.
> - "Ти читаєш?" (You read?)
> - "Він тут?" (He here?)
> It makes learning easier—fewer words to juggle!


## presentation

### Key 1: The Yes/No Question (Так чи Ні?)

As we hinted in the last module, the easiest way to ask a question is **Intonation**.
- **Ти знаєш.** (You know.) $\searrow$ (Falling tone)
- **Ти знаєш?** (Do you know?) $\nearrow$ (Rising tone like a surprise)

But sometimes, for polite emphasis or clarity, we use the particle **Чи** (Chy) at the start. **Чи** is like a flag that says "Hey! A question is coming!" It functions a bit like "Do" or "Is" in English questions.

**Pattern:** **Чи** + [Sentence]?
- **Чи** ти знаєш? (Do you know?)
- **Чи** це правда? (Is this true?)
- **Чи** він тут? (Is he here?)

**When to use Чи:**
- In formal writing (almost always).
- When you want to be very clear.
- When offering an alternative: "Кава **чи** чай?" (Coffee **or** tea?) -> Yes, "Чи" also means "Or"!

### Key 2: The Question Words (The "W" Words)

To get specific information, you need these power words. Note that most of them start with **K** or **Щ** or **Д**.

| Word | IPA | English | Example | Translation | Audio |
|------|-----|---------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Хто?** | /xtɔ/ | Who? | **Хто** це? | Who is this? | [🔊](audio_khto) |
| **Що?** | /ʃtʃɔ/ | What? | **Що** ти робиш? | What are you doing? | [🔊](audio_shcho) |
| **Де?** | /dɛ/ | Where? | **Де** ти? | Where are you? | [🔊](audio_de) |
| **Куди?** | /kuˈdɪ/ | Where to? | **Куди** ти йдеш? | Where are you going? | [🔊](audio_kudy) |
| **Коли?** | /kɔˈlɪ/ | When? | **Коли** обід? | When is lunch? | [🔊](audio_koly) |
| **Чому?** | /tʃɔˈmu/ | Why? | **Чому** ти тут? | Why are you here? | [🔊](audio_chomu) |
| **Як?** | /jɑk/ | How? | **Як** справи? | How are things? | [🔊](audio_yak) |
| **Скільки?** | /ˈsʲkʲilʲkɪ/ | How much? | **Скільки** коштує? | How much does it cost? | [🔊](audio_skilky) |

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Де vs. Куди**
> English uses "Where" for both location and direction. Ukrainian is precise!
> - **Де** = Location (Static). "Де ти?" (At what place are you?)
> - **Куди** = Direction (Motion). "Куди ми йдемо?" (To what place are we going?)
> Memorize: "**Де** is here, **Куди** is to go."

### Key 3: The Power of "No" (Negation)

Negation in Ukrainian is beautifully simple. You just put **Не** (Ne) immediately BEFORE the word you want to negate.

**Pattern:** Subject + **не** + Verb.
- Я **не** знаю. (I do not know.)
- Він **не** читає. (He is not reading.)
- Це **не** цікаво. (This is not interesting.)

**The Double Negative Rule:**
In English, logic suggests two negatives make a positive ("I don't know nothing" = I know something).
In Ukrainian, logic takes a backseat to **emphatic concord**. If the meaning is negative, every part of the sentence must agree to be negative!

**You must match the negative pronoun with the negative particle `не`.**
- **Ніколи** (Never) $\rightarrow$ Я **ніколи не** читаю. (I [never] [not] read.)
- **Ніхто** (Nobody) $\rightarrow$ **Ніхто не** знає. ([Nobody] [not] knows.)
- **Ніде** (Nowhere) $\rightarrow$ Він **ніде не** працює. (He works [nowhere] [not].)
- **Нічого** (Nothing) $\rightarrow$ Я **нічого не** бачу. (I see [nothing] [not].)


> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: The "No" of Steel**
> In many action movies dubbed in Ukrainian, the dramatic "NOOOOO!" is translated simply as "**НІ!**" But when a hero refuses a command, like "I will not do it!", they say "**Я не буду!**" (I will not!). The particle **не** is the shield that stops the action.

> 🎭 **Culture Corner: The Direct "No"**
> Ukrainians can be quite direct. If you ask "Do you want coffee?" and the answer is "Ні" (No), it's not rude. It's just efficient.
> However, "Ні, дякую" (No, thank you) is always better!


### Vocabulary: Asking and Answering
Let's add some adverbs to help you answer these questions.

- **Коли?** (When?) -> **Завжди** (Always), **Часто** (Often), **Рідко** (Rarely), **Іноді** (Sometimes).
- **Як?** (How?) -> **Добре** (Good/Well), **Погано** (Bad), **Швидко** (Fast), **Повільно** (Slowly).

## practice

**Drill 1: The Detective**
Imagine you are asking a suspect questions.
- **Хто** ви? (Who are you?)
- **Де** ви живете? (Where do you live? - *Wait, "живете" is Class I "-е-" stem!*)
- **Що** ви робите тут? (What are you doing here?)
- **Чому** ви не працюєте? (Why are you not working?)

**Drill 2: The Honest Friend**
Answer using frequency words.
- Q: Ти читаєш? (Do you read?)
- A: Так, я **часто** читаю. (Yes, I often read.)

- Q: Ти співаєш? (Do you sing?)
- A: Ні, я **ніколи не** співаю. (No, I [never] [not] sing.) -- *Remember the double negative!*

- Q: Ти гуляєш? (Do you walk?)
- A: Іноді. (Sometimes.)

- Q: Ти знаєш? (Do you know?)
- A: Звичайно! (Of course!)

> 🔗 **Language Link: "Of Course"**
> The word **Звичайно** comes from **Звичка** (Habit). So strictly speaking, it means "Usually" or "As per habit," but it is used exactly like "Of course" or "Certainly."


## production

Look at the room you are in. Ask 3 questions about it in your head (or aloud).
1. **Де** мій телефон? (Where is my phone?)
2. **Чому** тут холодно? (Why is it cold here?)
3. **Хто** там? (Who is there?)

Now turn these statements into negative sentences:
1. Я снідаю. $\rightarrow$ Я **не** снідаю.
2. Ми розуміємо. $\rightarrow$ Ми **не** розуміємо.
3. Вона слухає. $\rightarrow$ Вона **не** слухає.

# Summary

You have unlocked the conversation!
1.  **Ask Yes/No:** Use Intonation $\nearrow$ or add **Чи**.
2.  **Ask Details:** Use the **K/Щ/Д** words (Хто, Що, Де, Коли...).
3.  **Set Boundaries:** Use **Не** before the verb.
4.  **Double Down:** Use **Ніколи не** (Never not) for strong negation.

Now you can interrogate your friends: "Що ти робиш?" and judge their answers: "Це не цікаво." In the next module, we will expand your verb power to the second family: **Class II Verbs**.
