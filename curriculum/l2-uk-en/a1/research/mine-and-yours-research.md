### §4.2.3.2 — Possessive Pronouns (Присвійні займенники)

Ukrainian possessive pronouns indicate belonging and agree with the possessed noun in gender, number, and case (though A1 M14 focuses strictly on the Nominative case).

**Variable Forms (agreeing with the noun):**
- 1st Person: **мій** (my), **наш** (our)
- 2nd Person: **твій** (your), **ваш** (your formal/plural)
- 3rd Person Plural: **їхній** (their)
- Reflexive: **свій** (one's own)

**Invariable Forms (fixed regardless of the noun):**
- 3rd Person Singular: **його** (his/its), **її** (her)

*Note: In colloquial speech, the genitive forms of personal pronouns (його, її, їх) are often used as possessives, but the Standard emphasizes the adjectival nature of "їхній" for A1/A2 learners to practice gender agreement.*

### §4.2.3.4 — Interrogative Pronouns (Питальні займенники)

The question word for possession is **чий** (whose), which also agrees with the noun in gender and number:
- **Чий** це телефон? (m.)
- **Чия** це ручка? (f.)
- **Чиє** це вікно? (n.)
- **Чиї** це книги? (pl.)

## Vocabulary Frequency Notes

- **свій** — extremely high (top-30) as a reflexive marker

Lower-frequency / Complex for A1:
- **їхній** — medium frequency; often substituted by "їх" in speech, but crucial for understanding grammar patterns.

Common A1 Collocations:
- **мій друг / моя подруга** (my friend)
- **наша родина** (our family)
- **ваш паспорт** (your passport - formal)
- **моя адреса** (my address)

## Cultural Hooks

### Hook 1: The "Свій" Identity (Verified)
The pronoun **свій** (one's own) is deeply embedded in the Ukrainian psyche and proverbs. It often symbolizes belonging to a community or "one's own people." The proverb **«Своя сорочка ближче до тіла»** (One's own shirt is closer to the body) is a common way to express prioritizing one's immediate family or interests. In a modern context, during the invasion, the term **«свої»** is used to identify fellow Ukrainians or those supporting the cause.

### Hook 2: Formal Address (Ви/Ваш)
As noted in M04, the formal address **Ви** dictates the use of the possessive **Ваш**. Using **Ваш** with a stranger is a sign of "культурна людина" (a cultured person). Using **твій** too early is considered "тиканння" (tykannia) and can be seen as rude or overly aggressive in professional or service environments.

### Hook 3: Collective vs. Individual (Наш)
In Ukrainian culture, there is a strong tradition of collective reference. People often say **«наш університет»** (our university) or **«наша хата»** (our house) even if they are speaking as an individual, reflecting a sense of community ownership and pride in shared spaces.

## Pedagogical Notes

### 1. The "Whose Gender?" Trap
English speakers are used to "his" and "her" reflecting the **owner**. In Ukrainian, most possessives reflect the **object**.
- Example: **Його** (owner: man) **книга** (object: f.) — "Його" remains invariable.
- Example: **Мій** (owner: anyone) **телефон** (object: m.) vs **Моя** (owner: anyone) **ручка** (object: f.).
Learners often try to match the pronoun to their own gender rather than the noun's.

### 2. Variable vs. Invariable
A clear distinction must be made between **його/її** (which never change) and **мій/твій/наш/ваш/їхній** (which must match the noun). This is the primary logical hurdle for this module.

### 3. Reflexive "Свій" Introduction
Ukrainian requires **свій** when the possessor is the subject of the sentence.
- *English:* "I have my book." / "He has his book."
- *Ukrainian:* "Я маю **свою** книгу." / "Він має **свою** книгу." (If he has *his own* book).
- *Contrast:* "Він має **його** книгу" implies he has *someone else's* book.

## Scope Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Nominative forms only (singular m/f/n and plural).
- Agreement with A1-level concrete nouns (family, household objects, city locations).
- Question "Чий?" in all genders.
- Contrast between "його/її" (invariable) and others (variable).
- Basic introduction to reflexive "свій" in simple transitive sentences (S + V + Acc).

**Out of Scope:**
- Declension of possessives (Genitive, Dative, etc.). This comes in later levels.
- Complex reflexive use with multiple potential antecedents.
- Archaic or poetic forms (e.g., "мій" vs "моєго" in older texts).
- Post-positive possessives (though rare in modern UA, sometimes found in folklore).

## Cross-References
- **Builds on:** M03 (Gender), M04 (Personal Pronouns), M11-12 (Accusative nouns for "свій" contexts).
- **Prepares for:** M32 (My Family), B-Series (full declension).
