# Reflexive Verbs (-ся)

## Warm-up

In English, we say «I wash **myself**» or «We meet **each other**.» Ukrainian has a superpower for this: a tiny but mighty suffix **-ся**. This little addition changes the direction of the action entirely, transforming a standard verb into a reflexive one.

When you add **-ся** to the end of a verb, it essentially loops the action back onto the person performing it. This is a fundamental concept in Slavic languages that allows for precise expression of daily life and social interactions.
- **Мити** (to wash [something else, like a car or a plate]) → **Митися** (to wash [oneself]).
- **Одягати** (to dress [someone else, like a child]) → **Одягатися** (to get dressed/dress oneself).
- **Вчити** (to teach [someone else]) → **Вчитися** (to study/teach oneself).

Today, you'll learn how to talk about your daily routine, social interactions, and even your feelings using these special verbs! You'll find that these verbs are everywhere in Ukrainian, from the moment you wake up to the moment you say goodbye to a friend.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**

> **-ся** is short for **себе** (self). Historically, it was a separate word (a reflexive pronoun) that could move around in the sentence. Over many centuries, it eventually "glued" itself to the end of verbs to become a permanent suffix! This is why it always comes *after* the personal endings of the verb.

## Presentation

### The Magic Suffix: -ся vs. -сь

While the concept is simple, the form of the suffix changes slightly to keep the language sounding melodic and easy to speak. The rule is based on the sound that comes immediately before the suffix:

1. **-ся** (used after **consonants**): він миєть**ся**, ти вчиш**ся**. Most personal endings in Ukrainian end in a consonant, so you will see this form very often.
2. **-сь** (used after **vowels**): я мию**сь**, ми вчимо**сь**, ви вчите**сь**. This shortens the sound and prevents a "vowel clash," making the transition smoother.

> ⚡ **Pronunciation Hack**

> One of the most important things for a beginner to master is the pronunciation of the ending **-ться**. Although it looks like it should be pronounced literally, in standard Ukrainian, it sounds like a long, soft buzzing **[t͡sʲːɑ]** sound (like a very soft "ts-ts-ya"). 
> **Сміється** (he laughs) = /smiˈjɛt͡sʲːɑ/
> **Називається** (it is called) = /nɑzɪˈvɑjet͡sʲːɑ/

### Conjugation Pattern

Reflexive verbs are not "new" verbs to memorize from scratch. They follow the exact same First or Second Conjugation rules you have already mastered. The only difference is that you first conjugate the base verb as usual, and then tack on the appropriate reflexive suffix **-ся/-сь** at the very end.

**Example: називатися (to be called / name oneself)**
*First Conjugation (-ати pattern)*

| Person | Conjugation | Ending Rule | English |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Я** | називаю**сь** | (ю [vowel] + сь) | I am called |
| **Ти** | називаєш**ся** | (еш [consonant] + ся) | You are called |
| **Він/Вона** | називаєть**ся** | (е + ться [special rule]) | He/She/It is called |
| **Ми** | називаємо**сь** | (мо [vowel] + сь) | We are called |
| **Ви** | називаєте**сь** | (те [vowel] + сь) | You are called |
| **Вони** | називають**ся** | (ють [consonant] + ся) | They are called |

### Three Types of -ся Verbs

Understanding *why* a verb is reflexive will help you remember them more easily. We can group them into three main categories:

**1. True Reflexive (Action on Self)**
These are actions you do to your own body or mind.
- **Вмиватися** (to wash one's face/body).
- **Одягатися** (to dress oneself).
- **Готуватися** (to prepare oneself/get ready).
- **Голитися** (to shave oneself).

**2. Reciprocal (Action with Each Other)**
These actions require at least two people doing something together.
- **Зустрічатися** (to meet with someone).
- **Вітатися** (to greet each other).
- **Цілуватися** (to kiss each other).
- **Знайомитися** (to get acquainted/meet for the first time).
- «Ми зустрічаємось біля метро» = We are meeting by the metro.

**3. «Just Because» (Lexicalized)**
Some verbs in Ukrainian simply *must* have the reflexive suffix. They don't necessarily imply "self," but the verb doesn't exist without it, or its meaning changes completely.
- **Сміятися** (to laugh).
- **Усміхатися** (to smile).
- **Дивитися** (to watch/look).
- **Подобатися** (to like/be pleasing to).
- **Боятися** (to be afraid).

### Irregularities: сміятися & дивитися

Even though these verbs are common, they have some quirks in their conjugation that you should watch out for.

**сміятися (to laugh)**
Despite the -яти ending, this verb follows the First Conjugation vowel pattern (-є-).
- Я смію**сь**.
- Ти смієш**ся**.
- Він смієть**ся**.
- Ми сміємо**сь**.
- Ви смієте**сь**.
- Вони сміють**ся**.

**дивитися (to look/watch)**
This is a standard Second Conjugation verb, but it features a **consonant mutation** in the first person singular (Я). The letter **в** changes to **вл**.
- Я ди**вл**ю**сь** (Notice the extra **л**!).
- Ти дивиш**ся**.
- Він дивить**ся**.
- Ми дивимо**сь**.
- Ви дивите**сь**.
- Вони дивлять**ся**.

> [!important] **Usage Note: Як це називається?**
>
> When you want to ask «What is this called?» in Ukrainian, you are literally asking «How does this name itself?». This is the most natural way to learn new vocabulary!
> **— Як це називається?**
> **— Це називається телефон.** (This calls itself a phone.)
> **— Як ти називаєшся?** (What is your name? - *Informal variant of "Як тебе звати?"*)


### Mini-Dialogue 1: Meeting Up

**Андрій:** Привіт! Як ти?
**Олена:** Привіт! Все добре. Я **збираюся** (am getting ready) на роботу.
**Андрій:** А я **відпочиваю**.
**Олена:** Ти **дивишся** фільм?
**Андрій:** Так, я **дивлюсь** комедію. Я багато **сміюсь**!

**Translation:**
— Hi! How are you?
— Hi! All good. I'm getting ready for work.
— And I'm resting.
— Are you watching a movie?
— Yes, I'm watching a comedy. I laugh a lot!

### Mini-Dialogue 2: Morning Routine

**Мама:** Ти вже **прокинувся**? (Have you woken up? - *Past Tense preview!*)
**Син:** Так, я **вмиваюсь**.
**Мама:** Ти **снідаєш**?
**Син:** Ні, я ще **одягаюсь**.

## Cultural Insight

### The «Smile» Culture

In some cultures, smiling at strangers is normal. in Ukraine, a smile (**усмішка**) is often reserved for friends and genuine moments. If a stranger doesn't smile at you on the street, it's not rudeness—it's neutrality. But when Ukrainians **сміються** (laugh) with you, it's 100% sincere!
