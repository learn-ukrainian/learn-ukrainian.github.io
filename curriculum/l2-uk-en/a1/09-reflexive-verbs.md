# Reflexive Verbs (-ся)

## Warm-up

In English, we say "I wash **myself**" or "We meet **each other**." Ukrainian has a superpower for this: a tiny suffix **-ся**.

When you add **-ся** to the end of a verb, it turns the action back onto the subject.
- **Мити** (to wash [something]) → **Митися** (to wash [oneself]).
- **Одягати** (to dress [someone]) → **Одягатися** (to get dressed).

Today, you'll learn how to talk about your daily routine and social interactions using these special verbs!

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> **-ся** is short for **себе** (self). Historically, it was a separate word, but over centuries it glued itself to the verb!

## Presentation

### The Magic Suffix: -ся vs. -сь

The suffix has two forms depending on what comes before it:
1. **-ся** (after consonants): він миєть**ся**.
2. **-сь** (after vowels): я мию**сь**.

> ⚡ **Pronunciation Hack**
>
> The combination **-ться** (in "він сміється") is pronounced like a long, soft **[ц':а]** (ts'a).
> It does NOT sound like "t-s-y-a". It's a soft buzzing TS sound.
> **Сміється** = /smiˈjɛt͡sʲːɑ/

### Conjugation Pattern

Reflexive verbs follow the same First or Second Conjugation rules you already know, but with **-ся/-сь** added at the very end.

**Example: називатися (to be called / name oneself)**
*First Conjugation (-ати)*

| Person | Conjugation | Ending Rule | English |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Я** | називаю**сь** | (ю + сь) | I am called |
| **Ти** | називаєш**ся** | (еш + ся) | You are called |
| **Він/Вона** | називаєть**ся** | (е + ться) | He/She/It is called |
| **Ми** | називаємо**сь** | (мо + сь) | We are called |
| **Ви** | називаєте**сь** | (те + сь) | You are called |
| **Вони** | називають**ся** | (ють + ся) | They are called |

### Three Types of -ся Verbs

**1. True Reflexive (Action on Self)**
- **Вмиватися** (to wash face).
- **Одягатися** (to dress).
- **Готуватися** (to prepare oneself).

**2. Reciprocal (Action with Each Other)**
- **Зустрічатися** (to meet).
- **Вітатися** (to greet).
- **Цілуватися** (to kiss).
- "Ми зустрічаємось" = We meet each other.

**3. "Just Because" (Lexicalized)**
Some verbs *always* have -ся. They don't imply "self," they just are.
- **Сміятися** (to laugh).
- **Усміхатися** (to smile).
- **Дивитися** (to watch/look).
- **Подобатися** (to like).

### Irregular Verbs: сміятися & дивитися

These are **Second Conjugation** verbs, so they use **-ить/-ять** endings.

**сміятися (to laugh)**
- Я смію**сь**.
- Ти смієш**ся**.
- Він смієть**ся**.
- Вони сміють**ся**.
*(Note: This one actually follows First Conjugation vowel patterns in standard Ukrainian despite looking like -яти!)*

**дивитися (to look/watch)**
- Я дивлю**сь** (consonant mutation!).
- Ти дивиш**ся**.
- Він дивить**ся**.
- Ми дивимо**сь**.
- Вони дивлять**ся**.

> [!important] **Usage Note: Як це називається?**
>
> To ask "What is this called?", use:
> **— Як це називається?** (How does this call itself?)
> **— Це називається телефон.** (This is called a phone.)

## Cultural Insight

### The "Smile" Culture

In some cultures, smiling at strangers is normal. in Ukraine, a smile (**усмішка**) is often reserved for friends and genuine moments. If a stranger doesn't smile at you on the street, it's not rudeness—it's neutrality. But when Ukrainians **сміються** (laugh) with you, it's 100% sincere!
