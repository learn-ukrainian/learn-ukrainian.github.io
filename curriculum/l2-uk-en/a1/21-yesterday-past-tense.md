# Yesterday - Past Tense

## Warm-up

What did you do yesterday? Last week? A long time ago? Every language needs a way to talk about the past, and Ukrainian's solution is elegant: take the verb stem and add a special ending that shows **who** did the action.

Unlike English, where "I worked" and "she worked" look the same, Ukrainian past tense changes based on **gender**, not person. "I worked" is different for men (я працював) and women (я працювала). Once you see the pattern, it's surprisingly easy!

> [!important] **Aspect Awareness**
>
> 💡 **Note:** This is the **imperfective past tense** (describing ongoing or repeated actions).
>
> Ukrainian also has **perfective past tense** (for completed actions with results).
> You'll learn about this distinction in A2 when we study "aspect"!
>
> For now: читав = "was reading" (ongoing)

> [!tip] **Чи знаєте ви? (Did You Know?)**
>
> Минулий час (past tense) часто має букву **л**! Вона читала. Воно читало. Ми читали. Feminine, neuter, and plural forms always contain the letter **л**. Masculine forms usually end in **в** (Я читав), which historically evolved from an _l_ sound!

## Presentation

### How Ukrainian Past Tense Works

The past tense in Ukrainian is beautifully simple. You take the infinitive (like читати — to read), remove -ти, and add:

| Who                          | Ending  | Example |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| він (he)                     | -**в**  | читав   |
| вона (she)                   | -**ла** | читала  |
| воно (it)                    | -**ло** | читало  |
| вони / ми / ви (they/we/you) | -**ли** | читали  |

**Key insight:** The ending matches the **gender of the subject**, not the person. So "I read" is:

- Я читав (if you're male)
- Я читала (if you're female)

### Formation Step by Step

**Step 1:** Take the infinitive

- читати (to read)
- працювати (to work)
- говорити (to speak)

**Step 2:** Remove -ти

- чита-
- працюва-
- говори-

**Step 3:** Add gender ending

- читав / читала / читало / читали
- працював / працювала / працювало / працювали
- говорив / говорила / говорило / говорили

### The Magic Return of -ва-

Remember how verbs like **працювати** lost their **-ва-** in the present tense (я працюю)?
Good news: In the past tense, the **-ва-** comes back!

The past tense is built from the **infinitive** (dictionary form), so the **-ва-** stays right there.

| Verb | Present (Now) | Past (Yesterday) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **працювати** | я працюю (no -ва-) | я працю**ва**в (has -ва-!) |
| **танцювати** | я танцюю | я танцю**ва**в |
| **подорожувати** | я подорожую | я подорожу**ва**в |

**Rule:** Present tense = drop -ва-. Past tense = keep -ва-.

### Reflexive Verbs in the Past (-ся)

Reflexive verbs (Module 09) follow the same gender rules, but you keep the **-ся** at the end.

**Pattern:** Gender Ending + **-ся**.

Let's look at **сміятися** (to laugh):

| Who | Formation | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Він** | сміяв + ся | **сміявся** |
| **Вона** | сміяла + ся | **сміялася** |
| **Воно** | сміяло + ся | **сміялося** |
| **Вони** | сміяли + ся | **сміялися** |

> Look at these sentences. What do you notice about the verb endings?
>
> - Він читав книгу. (He was reading a book.)
> - Вона читала книгу. (She was reading a book.)
> - Ми читали книгу. (We were reading a book.)
>
> The verb changes based on who is speaking, not what tense it is!

### Time Expressions for the Past

When did it happen? Use these words:

| Ukrainian       | English              | Example                        |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| вчора           | yesterday            | Вчора я працював.              |
| позавчора       | day before yesterday | Позавчора вона приїхала.       |
| минулого тижня  | last week            | Минулого тижня ми говорили.    |
| минулого місяця | last month           | Минулого місяця він поїхав.    |
| минулого року   | last year            | Минулого року вони зустрілися. |
| давно           | long ago             | Давно це було.                 |
| недавно         | recently             | Недавно я почув новину.        |
| раніше          | earlier, before      | Раніше тут був ресторан.       |
| колись          | once, sometime       | Колись я був там.              |

> [!example] **Pop Culture Moment**
>
> In the famous Ukrainian song "Червона рута" (Red Rue), the singer reminisces about finding a magical flower: "Я знайшов її колись..." (I found it once...). Past tense + колись = perfect for nostalgic stories!
