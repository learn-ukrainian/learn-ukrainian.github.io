# Checkpoint - First Contact

**Вітаємо! Congratulations!** You've made it through the first nine modules of Ukrainian! You've unlocked the Cyrillic code, mastered noun genders, conjugated your first verbs, asked questions, and explored Ukrainian food. Now it's time to **consolidate** everything you've learned and check your progress.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> In Ukrainian schools, "checkpoint" lessons are called **"контрольна робота"** (kontrolna robota) - literally "control work". But don't worry - this module is about **review and celebration**, not punishment! Think of it as your А1.1 victory lap.

Think back to Module 01, when letters like **Щ, Ї, Ґ** looked like mysterious symbols. Now you can read them! You've gone from **"Що це?"** (What is this?) to **"Я читаю українською!"** (I read in Ukrainian!). That's huge progress in just 10 modules.

## Warm-up: Your А1.1 Journey

Let's retrace your path through the first contact phase:

**Modules 01-02: The Cyrillic Code**
You learned all 33 letters - True Friends (А, Е, О), False Friends (В, Н, Р), and Unique Ukrainian letters (Ї, Є, Ґ). You discovered that **"Б"** is not "6", **"Н"** is not "N", and **"І"** is not "i". Now you can read signs, menus, and street names in Ukraine!

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: Reading Ukrainian**
>
> Remember when we said Ukrainian gamers can instantly read both Cyrillic and Latin? After 10 modules, **you're now one of them!** Try reading Ukrainian song lyrics on YouTube - you'll be surprised how much you recognize.

**Modules 03-05: Noun Gender & Demonstratives**
You learned the gender system: **-а/-я = feminine**, **consonant = masculine**, **-о/-е = neuter**. You mastered demonstratives: **цей стіл, ця книга, це вікно, ці двері**. Now you can point at things and describe them!

**Modules 06-08: The Living Verbs**
You conjugated your first verbs! Class I (**-ати: читаю, читаєш, читає...**) and Class II (**-ити: говорю, говориш, говорить...**). You learned question words (**що, хто, де, коли, чому, як**) and negation (**не**). Now you can express actions, ask questions, and say what you DON'T do.

**Module 09: Food & Drinks**
You explored Ukrainian cuisine - **борщ, вареники, хліб, кава, чай** - and learned to say **"Смачного!"** (Bon appétit!). Now you can order food in a Ukrainian кафе!

## Presentation: What You've Mastered

### 1. The Cyrillic Alphabet (33 letters)

You can now read ALL Ukrainian letters, including the tricky ones:

| Letter | Sound | English Example | Ukrainian Word |
|--------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| Ї | /ji/ | yes | Їжа (yizha) - food |
| Є | /je/ | yes | Європа (Yevropa) - Europe |
| Щ | /ʃt͡ʃ/ | fresh cheese | Ще (shche) - still, yet |
| Ч | /t͡ʃ/ | cheese | Чай (chay) - tea |
| Ш | /ʃ/ | shoe | Шоколад (shokolad) - chocolate |
| Ґ | /ɡ/ | go | Ґанок (ganok) - porch |
| Г | /ɦ/ | ahead (breathy) | Гарний (harnyy) - beautiful |

**Reading Practice:** Can you read this sentence without transliteration?

**Я люблю українську мову. Вона дуже гарна і мелодійна.**

<details>
<summary>Translation</summary>
I love the Ukrainian language because it's very beautiful and melodic.
</details>

> 🌍 **Real World Tip**
>
> When you arrive in Ukraine, the first thing you'll see is signs in Cyrillic. After these 10 modules, you'll be able to **read street names, metro stations, shop signs** - even if you don't know every word, you can SOUND IT OUT. That's a superpower!

### 2. Noun Gender (3 genders, 4 families)

You know how to identify gender by ending:

| Gender | Ending | Examples |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Masculine** | consonant, -о (few) | стіл (table), банк (bank), тато (dad) |
| **Feminine** | -а, -я, -ь | книга (book), земля (earth), ніч (night) |
| **Neuter** | -о, -е | вікно (window), море (sea) |

And you know the **4 Declension Families**:
1. **Family 1:** -а/-я feminines (**мама, земля**)
2. **Family 2:** Consonant masculines + -о/-е neuters (**стіл, вікно**)
3. **Family 3:** Soft consonant feminines (**ніч, любов**)
4. **Family 4:** Neuters ending in -а/-я that gain suffixes (**ім'я → імені**)

**Quick Test:** What gender are these words?
- **книга** → Feminine (-а)
- **чай** → Masculine (consonant)
- **вікно** → Neuter (-о)

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Gender Intuition**
>
> After 10 modules, your brain is starting to develop **gender intuition**. When you hear **"цікава книга"**, it SOUNDS right. **"Цікавий книга"** feels wrong. That's your Ukrainian instinct kicking in!

### 3. Zero Copula (No "to be" in present)

You learned that Ukrainian drops **"to be"** in present tense:

| English | Ukrainian |
|---------|-----------|
| I am a student. | Я студент. |
| This is a book. | Це книга. |
| She is Ukrainian. | Вона українка. |

**Mini-Dialogue: At a Lviv Coffee Shop**

— Привіт! Ти студент?
— Так, я студент. А ти?
— Я студентка. Це твоя книга?
— Так, це моя книга. Вона цікава.

*(Hi! Are you a student? / Yes, I'm a student. And you? / I'm a student (f). Is this your book? / Yes, it's my book. It's interesting.)*

### 4. Demonstratives (цей, ця, це, ці)

You mastered pointing words that agree with noun gender:

| Singular | | Plural |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **цей** (m) | **ця** (f) | **ці** (all genders) |
| цей стіл | ця книга | ці книги |
| **це** (n) | | ці столи |
| це вікно | | ці вікна |

**Pattern Practice:**

Це **цей** стіл? — Так, це **цей** стіл.
Це **ця** книга? — Так, це **ця** книга.
Це **це** вікно? — Так, це **це** вікно.

> 🎯 **Fun Fact: "Це" Triple Play**
>
> Ukrainian **"це"** does THREE jobs:
> 1. **Demonstrative (neuter):** це вікно (this window)
> 2. **"This is" (copula):** Це книга. (This is a book.)
> 3. **"It":** Це правда. (It's true.)
>
> One word, three roles! Efficient Ukrainian strikes again.

### 5. Present Tense Verbs (Class I & II)

You conjugated two major verb classes:

**Class I (-ати/-яти):** читати (to read)

| Person | Conjugation | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| я | читаю | Я читаю книгу. |
| ти | читаєш | Ти читаєш газету. |
| він/вона | читає | Вона читає журнал. |
| ми | читаємо | Ми читаємо багато. |
| ви | читаєте | Ви читаєте українською. |
| вони | читають | Вони читають щодня. |

**Class II (-ити):** говорити (to speak)

| Person | Conjugation | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| я | говорю | Я говорю українською. |
| ти | говориш | Ти говориш англійською. |
| він/вона | говорить | Він говорить швидко. |
| ми | говоримо | Ми говоримо повільно. |
| ви | говорите | Ви говорите голосно. |
| вони | говорять | Вони говорять тихо. |

**Irregulars:** You also learned special verbs like **їсти (їм, їси, їсть...)** and **пити (п'ю, п'єш, п'є...)**.

**Mini-Dialogue: Kyiv University Library**

— Що ти читаєш?
— Я читаю книгу про Україну. А ти?
— Я пишу есе українською.
— Вау! Ти добре говориш українською!
— Дякую! Я вчуся кожен день.

*(What are you reading? / I'm reading a book about Ukraine. And you? / I'm writing an essay in Ukrainian. / Wow! You speak Ukrainian well! / Thank you! I study every day.)*

### 6. Questions & Negation

You learned to form **yes/no questions** with **чи** and **wh-questions** with question words:

| Question Word | Meaning | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| що | what | Що це? (What is this?) |
| хто | who | Хто він? (Who is he?) |
| де | where | Де ти? (Where are you?) |
| куди | where to | Куди ти йдеш? (Where are you going?) |
| коли | when | Коли ти вдома? (When are you home?) |
| чому | why | Чому ти тут? (Why are you here?) |
| як | how | Як справи? (How are things?) |
| скільки | how much | Скільки це коштує? (How much does this cost?) |

**Negation:** Add **не** before the verb.

- Я читаю. → Я **не** читаю.
- Вона говорить. → Вона **не** говорить.

**Question Practice:**

**Чи** ти студент? — Так, я студент.
**Що** ти робиш? — Я читаю книгу.
**Хто** вона? — Вона студентка.

> 🔗 **Language Link**
>
> English question word order: **Do you read?**
> Ukrainian: Same word order as statement! **Ти читаєш?** OR add **чи** for emphasis: **Чи ти читаєш?**
> Ukrainian is more flexible!

### 7. Food Vocabulary

You explored Ukrainian cuisine and learned essential food words:

**Meals:**
- **сніданок** (snidanok) - breakfast
- **обід** (obid) - lunch
- **вечеря** (vecherya) - dinner

**Dishes:**
- **борщ** (borshch) - beet soup
- **вареники** (varenyky) - dumplings
- **хліб** (khlib) - bread
- **м'ясо** (m'yaso) - meat

**Drinks:**
- **кава** (kava) - coffee
- **чай** (chay) - tea
- **вода** (voda) - water
- **сік** (sik) - juice
- **молоко** (moloko) - milk

**Saying "Bon appétit!"**
**Смачного!** (Smachnoho!)

**Mini-Dialogue: Ordering at a Kyiv Café**

— Добрий день! Що ви бажаєте?
— Каву, будь ласка.
— Американо чи латте?
— Американо, будь ласка.
— Ще щось?
— Так, вареники.
— Смачного!

*(Good day! What would you like? / Coffee, please. / Americano or latte? / Americano with milk. / Anything else? / Yes, varenyky with cheese. / Bon appétit!)*

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: Ukrainian Food in Games**
>
> In the game **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** (made by Ukrainian studio GSC Game World), you find **ковбаса (sausage), хліб (bread), and консерви (canned food)** to restore health. The game is full of Ukrainian food and language - now you can recognize them!

## Practice: Integrated Skills

Now let's combine everything you've learned into real communication scenarios!

### Scenario 1: Introducing Yourself in Lviv

You're at a language exchange in Lviv. Introduce yourself:

**Модель (Model):**

Привіт! Мене звати [Your Name]. Я студент / студентка. Я з [Your Country]. Я вивчаю українську мову. Я читаю українською, але говорю повільно. Я люблю українську їжу - особливо борщ і вареники!

**Your Turn:** Write your own introduction using the model above.

### Scenario 2: Coffee Shop Conversation

You meet a Ukrainian friend at a Kyiv coffee shop.

— Привіт! Як справи?
— Добре, дякую! А у тебе?
— Теж добре. Що ти читаєш?
— Я читаю книгу українською. Вона дуже цікава.
— Що ти п'єш?
— Я п'ю каву. А ти?
— Я п'ю чай.
— Смачного!

**Practice:** Act out this dialogue with different drinks and books!

### Scenario 3: Describing Your Room

Use demonstratives and gender agreement to describe objects:

**Модель:**

Це **моя** кімната. Це **мій** стіл. Це **моя** книга. Це **моє** вікно. Це **мої** двері. **Ця** книга цікава. **Цей** стіл новий. **Це** вікно велике.

**Your Turn:** Describe your own room using цей/ця/це/ці and мій/моя/моє/мої.

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Gender Check**
>
> By Module 10, you can HEAR when gender is wrong. **"Це моя стіл"** sounds wrong. **"Це мій стіл"** sounds right! Your Ukrainian instinct is growing!

## Cultural Insight: The Warmth of Ukrainian Greetings

In these 10 modules, you've learned basic greetings: **привіт, добрий день, дякую, будь ласка**. But there's something special about how Ukrainians greet each other that goes beyond words.

### The Three-Kiss Rule

When Ukrainian friends meet (especially women), they often greet with **three kisses** on alternating cheeks. Why three? Some say it represents the Holy Trinity. Others say it's just the Ukrainian way of showing warmth. Either way, it's more affectionate than the Western European two-kiss!

> 🎭 **Culture Corner: "Як справи?"**
>
> In English, "How are you?" is often automatic - people don't expect a real answer. In Ukrainian, **"Як справи?"** is a genuine question. Ukrainians will tell you the TRUTH - good, bad, complicated. And they expect you to listen!
>
> Common honest answers:
> - **Нормально.** (So-so. / It's okay.)
> - **Непогано.** (Not bad.)
> - **Бувало й краще.** (I've had better days.)
> - **Чудово!** (Wonderfully!)

### Food = Love

You learned Ukrainian food vocabulary, but here's the cultural context: in Ukrainian culture, **feeding someone is an act of love**. If you visit a Ukrainian home, expect to be fed MULTIPLE courses. You might hear:

**— Їж, їж! Ти ж нічого не їв!**
*(Eat, eat! You haven't eaten anything!)*

...even if you just finished three plates.

When you finish a meal, always say **"Дякую, було дуже смачно!"** (Thank you, it was very delicious!). It's not just polite - it's recognition of the love that went into cooking.

> 💡 **Did You Know? Ukrainian Hospitality Proverb**
>
> **"Гість у дім — Бог у дім."**
> *(A guest in the home is God in the home.)*
>
> This old Ukrainian proverb explains why hospitality is sacred. When you enter a Ukrainian home, you're not just a visitor - you're honored like a divine presence. That's why the table will be LOADED with food!

## Production: Your А1.1 Portfolio

You've come so far! Let's consolidate your knowledge with creative tasks.

### Task 1: Write a Short Introduction (50-100 words)

Write about yourself in Ukrainian. Include:
- Your name and where you're from
- What you do (student, work, hobby)
- What you're reading or studying
- Your favorite Ukrainian food or drink

**Example:**

*Мене звати Анна. Я студентка. Я вивчаю українську мову. Я люблю Україну. Я читаю книги українською. Я люблю борщ і вареники. Я також люблю українську каву. Я говорю українською повільно. Я вчуся кожен день!*

### Task 2: Create a Mini-Dialogue

Write a short conversation (6-8 lines) at a café, bookstore, or university. Use:
- Greetings (**привіт, добрий день**)
- Questions (**що, де, чи**)
- Present tense verbs
- Food/drink vocabulary

### Task 3: Reading Challenge

Read this short paragraph WITHOUT transliteration. Then summarize it in English.

**Текст:**

Київ - це столиця України. Це дуже гарне місто. Київ - це метро, парки, музеї і ресторани. Українці люблять каву. Київ - це багато кафе. Студенти читають книги і п'ють каву. Київ - це історичне місто. Я люблю Київ!

<details>
<summary>Summary Check</summary>
The text describes Kyiv as the capital of Ukraine, a beautiful city with metro, parks, museums, and restaurants. Ukrainians love coffee, and there are many cafes in Kyiv. Students read books in cafes and drink coffee. Kyiv is a historic city. The author loves Kyiv.
</details>
