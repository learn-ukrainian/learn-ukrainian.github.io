# The Cyrillic Code I

## Warm-up

You're about to crack a code that 45 million people use every day. The Ukrainian Cyrillic alphabet isn't as foreign as it looks. In fact, you already know how to read about a third of it. Some letters are **True Friends** (they look AND sound like their English equivalents). Some are **False Friends** (they look familiar but make completely different sounds). And some are entirely new.

Think of learning Cyrillic like learning to read again. But this time, it only takes a few hours instead of a few years. By the end of this module, you'll be reading real Ukrainian words. Let's start with the letters you already know.

## Presentation

### The True Friends (7 letters)

These letters look and sound almost identical to their English counterparts. When you see them, read them exactly as you would in English:

| Letter  | Sound             | Example      | English |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| **А а** | /ɑ/ like «father» | м**а**м**а** | mama    |
| **Е е** | /ɛ/ like «bet»    | м**е**тро    | metro   |
| **І і** | /i/ like «meet»   | к**і**но     | cinema  |
| **О о** | /ɔ/ like «soft»   | д**о**ктор   | doctor  |
| **К к** | /k/ like «kite»   | **к**іт      | cat     |
| **М м** | /m/ like «mom»    | **м**аска    | mask    |
| **Т т** | /t/ like «top»    | **т**акт     | tact    |

These are your **True Friends**. When you see А, О, Е, І, К, М, Т, read them just like English. The word **тато** (dad) uses only these letters: T-A-T-O. The word **метро** (metro) also uses letters you'll recognize: M-E-T-R-O. Wait, what about that Р? That's where things get interesting.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> The Cyrillic alphabet wasn't invented by Russians. It was created in the 9th century in Bulgaria by followers of Saints Cyril and Methodius. Ukraine adopted Cyrillic independently through the medieval state of Kyivan Rus'. Russian didn't even exist as a distinct language when Cyrillic was created!

### The False Friends (6 letters)

These letters LOOK like English letters but make COMPLETELY different sounds. This is where English speakers get tripped up:

| Letter  | Looks Like | Actually Says            | Example   | English |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------------------ | --------- | ------- |
| **В в** | B          | /v/ like «van»           | ка**в**а  | coffee  |
| **Н н** | H          | /n/ like «no»            | ба**н**к  | bank    |
| **Р р** | P          | /r/ like «red» (rolled)  | **р**адіо | radio   |
| **С с** | C          | /s/ like «sun»           | **с**уп   | soup    |
| **У у** | Y          | /u/ like «moon»          | с**у**п   | soup    |
| **Х х** | X          | /x/ like Scottish «loch» | **х**ор   | choir   |

The word **банк** (bank) has the False Friend **Н** (sounds like N, not H). So it's pronounced «bank», not «bahk»!

Look at **радіо** (radio): the **Р** looks like a P, but it's actually an R. So it says «radio». Exactly what you'd expect, just with a different letter!

> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** «Russian and Ukrainian are basically the same language.»
> **Fact:** Ukrainian and Russian are as different as Spanish and Portuguese. They share Cyrillic roots, but Ukrainian has unique letters (Ї, Є, Ґ) that Russian doesn't have. They have different grammar and thousands of words that don't exist in Russian.

### The New Letters (6 letters)

These letters are completely new to English speakers. But don't worry. They represent sounds you can make:

| Letter  | Sound           | Example    | English |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| **Б б** | /b/ like «ball» | **б**анан  | banana  |
| **Д д** | /d/ like «dog»  | **д**октор | doctor  |
| **З з** | /z/ like «zoo»  | ва**з**а   | vase    |
| **Л л** | /l/ like «love» | **л**ото   | lotto   |
| **П п** | /p/ like «pet»  | **п**арк   | park    |
| **Ф ф** | /f/ like «fun»  | **ф**ото   | photo   |

The word **футбол** (football) uses several new letters: **Ф** (f), **У** (u, False Friend!), **Т** (t, True Friend), **Б** (b), **О** (o, True Friend), **Л** (l). Put it together: f-u-t-b-o-l. Football!

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.**
>
> The famous Ukrainian video game **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** was made by GSC Game World in Kyiv. In Ukrainian, «stalker» is written **сталкер**. You can decode it using False Friends: С (s), Т (t), А (a), Л (l), К (k), Е (e), Р (r). The game is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone.

## Practice

### Reading International Words

Many words in Ukrainian are international. They're borrowed from Latin, Greek, or English. Once you know the letters, you can read these immediately.

**Places:**
Банк (bank). Парк (park). Кафе (café). Бар (bar). Ресторан (restaurant).

**Food:**
Кава (coffee). Суп (soup). Салат (salad). Тост (toast). Банан (banana). Какао (cocoa). Піца (pizza). Лимон (lemon).

**Technology:**
Метро (metro). Радіо (radio). Телефон (telephone). Інтернет (internet). Фото (photo). Відео (video).

### Mini-Dialogue 1: At the Metro Station

— Тут метро? *(Tut metro?)* — Is the metro here?
— Так, метро. *(Tak, metro.)* — Yes, the metro.

Notice how **метро** looks almost English? That's because it IS almost English. Just written in Cyrillic!

### Mini-Dialogue 2: At a Café

— Кава? *(Kava?)* — Coffee?
— Так, кава. *(Tak, kava.)* — Yes, coffee.

The word **кава** comes from the same root as English «coffee» but took a different path through Turkish and Arabic. In Ukrainian, it sounds like «kava.»

### Decoding Strategies

When you see a word in Cyrillic, your brain might feel overwhelmed at first. Follow these three steps to crack the code:

1.  **Identify the True Friends**: Look for letters like **А, К, М**. These are your anchors. They look and sound exactly like you expect, giving you a head start on the word.
2.  **Beware of the False Friends**: This is where most beginners trip up. When you see a **Р**, consciously tell yourself: «That is an R, not a P.» When you see **В**, remind yourself: «That is a V, not a B.» Slowing down at these letters will prevent common reading errors.
3.  **Trust the Phonetics**: Unlike English, where «cough» and «dough» look similar but sound different, Ukrainian is very consistent. One letter almost always equals one sound. There are no silent letters to worry about here!

## Cultural Insight

### Why Ukrainian Uses Cyrillic

When people see Cyrillic, they often think «Russian alphabet.» But Cyrillic belongs to no single nation. It was created specifically for Slavic peoples. Bulgarians, Serbs, Ukrainians, and others used it centuries before the Russian Empire even existed. In fact, Kyiv was a major center of literacy and culture when Moscow was still just a forest.

Ukrainian Cyrillic has 33 letters. Some exist only in Ukrainian, making the language look distinct on the page compared to its neighbors:

**І і** — Ukrainian has this simple «ee» sound like in «meet».

**Ї ї** — A uniquely Ukrainian sound (we'll learn it in Module 2).

**Є є** — Another uniquely Ukrainian letter.

**Ґ ґ** — A hard «g» sound that Russian lost centuries ago.

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> When you visit **Київ** (Kyiv, note the Ukrainian spelling!), you'll see Cyrillic everywhere: on metro stations, street signs, restaurant menus, and shop windows. The words банк, кафе, бар, ресторан, метро are all around you. And now you can read them!

### The Letter Count

Today you learned **19 letters**. That's more than half the alphabet! Only 14 letters remain for Module 2.

## Production

Now it's time to test your decoding skills. Look at these Ukrainian words and try to read them aloud:

Таксі /tɑkˈsi/ (taxi). Опера /ˈɔpɛrɑ/ (opera). Балет /bɑˈlɛt/ (ballet). Актор /ɑkˈtɔr/ (actor). Паспорт /ˈpɑspɔrt/ (passport). Віза /ˈvizɑ/ (visa). Карта /ˈkɑrtɑ/ (card/map). Комета /kɔˈmɛtɑ/ (comet). Ракета /rɑˈkɛtɑ/ (rocket). Какао /kɑˈkɑɔ/ (cocoa).

Every single one of these is an international word that you already know. Just written in a different alphabet!

# Підсумок

In this module, you learned:

**True Friends** (7 letters): А, Е, І, О, К, М, Т. They look AND sound like English.

**False Friends** (6 letters): В (v), Н (n), Р (r), С (s), У (u), Х (kh). They look familiar but sound different.

**New Letters** (6 letters): Б (b), Д (d), З (z), Л (l), П (p), Ф (f). They are completely new shapes.

You can now read **35 international words** in Ukrainian. The key insight: many «Ukrainian» words are actually international words you already know, just written in Cyrillic.

**Remember:** В is V, not B. Н is N, not H. Р is R, not P. С is S, not C. У is U, not Y. Х is like Scottish «loch.»
