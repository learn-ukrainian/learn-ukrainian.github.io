1. **Content** (the lesson you're reviewing): `# This Is / I Am

## Warm-up

Here's something that feels strange at first: Ukrainian doesn't use «am,» «is,» or «are» in the present tense!

In English, we say: «I **am** a student. She **is** Ukrainian. This **is** a book.»

In Ukrainian, you just... skip it:

- Я студент. (I student.)
- Вона українка. (She Ukrainian.)
- Це книга. (This book.)

Why? Because Ukrainian belongs to the «pro-drop» language family. The verb «to be» (бути) exists, but in present tense statements, it's invisible—like an understood handshake. You know it's there, but you don't say it.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Russian and Ukrainian both drop the verb «to be» in the present tense, but this feature actually comes from ancient Proto-Slavic. It's not copying—it's inheritance! English used to do this too in Old English, but lost the pattern over time.

## Presentation

### Personal Pronouns

Ukrainian has the same number of pronouns as English, but with one important split: the formal «you.»

| Pronoun | IPA     | English                         | When to use                                                  |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| я       | /jɑ/    | I                               | Always singular, always lowercase (except at sentence start) |
| ти      | /tɪ/    | you (singular informal)         | Friends, family, children, pets                              |
| він     | /ʋin/   | he                              | Masculine people, masculine nouns                            |
| вона    | /ʋɔˈnɑ/ | she                             | Feminine people, feminine nouns                              |
| воно    | /ʋɔˈnɔ/ | it                              | Neuter nouns, rarely for people                              |
| ми      | /mɪ/    | we                              | Plural first person                                          |
| ви      | /ʋɪ/    | you (plural OR formal singular) | Multiple people OR one person (formal/respectful)            |
| вони    | /ʋɔˈnɪ/ | they                            | Plural third person (all genders)                            |

**The Ви vs Ти Choice**

This is crucial for politeness:

- **Ти** (informal): Use with friends your age, family members you're close to, children, animals.
- **Ви** (formal): Use with strangers, authority figures (professors, doctors, bosses), elders, or anyone you want to show respect to.

**Real-life scenario:**

You meet your Ukrainian teacher for the first time:

- ❌ Як твоє ім'я? (Too informal—sounds rude!)
- ✅ Як Ваше ім'я? (Polite and respectful)

Later, after a few months, the teacher might say: «Можеш мене на 'ти'.» (You can call me 'ти'.) — This is an invitation to switch to informal address.

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> In modern Ukraine, young people often use «ти» with each other immediately, even if they just met. But when in doubt, start with «Ви»—it's always safer. Ukrainians will tell you if they prefer «ти.»

### The Zero Copula (Нульова зв'язка)

«Copula» is a grammar term for linking verbs like «am,» «is,» «are.» In Ukrainian present tense, this verb is **zero**—it disappears.

**Pattern: Subject + Predicate (no verb)**

| Ukrainian        | Word-for-word | English            |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Я студент.       | I student     | I am a student     |
| Ти лікар?        | You doctor?   | Are you a doctor?  |
| Він українець.   | He Ukrainian  | He is Ukrainian    |
| Вона професорка. | She professor | She is a professor |
| Це книга.        | This book     | This is a book     |

The linking verb «є» (is/are) exists, but it's only used for emphasis or in writing. In speech, you'll almost never hear it:

- Київ місто. (Kyiv is a city.)
- Київ є місто. (Sounds overly formal, bookish)

> 🔗 **Language Link**
>
> English did this too! In older English, you'd say «I student» in certain contexts. Modern English kept the verb, but Ukrainian streamlined it away. Both are logical—just different choices.

**Using Це (This is / These are)**

«Це» (tse) is the most useful word for pointing out things and people:

- Це Марко. (This is Marko.)
- Це моя подруга. (This is my friend.)
- Це книга. (This is a book.)
- Це студенти. (These are students.)

Notice: «це» doesn't change for plural! It works for one thing or many things. Context makes it clear.

**Mini-dialogue: Meeting Someone**

A: Привіт! Я Анна. А ти хто?
(Hi! I'm Anna. And who are you?)

B: Я Марко. Це моя подруга Софія.
(I'm Marko. This is my friend Sofiya.)

A: Добре! Ви студенти?
(Good! Are you students?)

B: Так, ми студенти. А ти?
(Yes, we're students. And you?)

A: Я професорка.
(I'm a professor.)

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: Groot's Perfect Ukrainian**
>
> In the Ukrainian dub of *Guardians of the Galaxy*, Groot says «Я Ґрут» (I Groot). No verb needed! It's grammatically perfect Ukrainian—subject + predicate. Groot would ace this module.

### People and Professions

When talking about people, Ukrainian distinguishes **masculine** and **feminine** forms for most nationalities and professions:

| Masculine   | Feminine   | English        |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| українець   | українка   | Ukrainian      |
| англієць    | англійка   | English person |
| американець | американка | American       |
| канадець    | канадка    | Canadian       |
| студент     | студентка  | student        |
| професор    | професорка | professor      |
| лікар       | лікарка    | doctor         |
| інженер     | інженерка  | engineer       |
| менеджер    | менеджерка | manager        |

**Pattern:** Most feminine forms add **-ка** to the masculine stem.

**Usage:**

- Він інженер, вона інженерка. (He's an engineer, she's an engineer.)
- Я менеджер. (I'm a manager.)
- Він американець. (He's American.)
- Вона американка. (She's American.)
- Я студент. (I'm a student—said by a male.)
- Я студентка. (I'm a student—said by a female.)

**Gender-neutral/unknown:** In Ukrainian, if you don't know someone's gender, you'd typically use the masculine form as default, but this is evolving. When addressing mixed groups, use the plural:

- Вони студенти. (They are students—mixed or all male.)
- Вони студентки. (They are students—all female.)

> 🎯 **Fun Fact**
>
> The word «лікар» comes from «ліки» (medicine) + «-ар» (one who works with). The feminine «лікарка» is now the standard term, replacing the older «лікар» (used for both genders) which some older speakers still use. Language evolves!

**Mini-dialogue: Introductions**

A: Вона професорка?
(Is she a professor?)

B: Ні, вона лікарка.
(No, she's a doctor.)

A: А він?
(And he?)

B: Він студент.
(He's a student.)

### Common Identity Words

Beyond nationalities and professions, here are key people words:

| Ukrainian | IPA         | English         | Gender      |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| людина    | /lʲuˈdɪnɑ/  | person, human   | f (for all) |
| чоловік   | /t͡ʃɔlɔˈʋik/ | man             | m           |
| жінка     | /ˈʒinkɑ/    | woman           | f           |
| хлопець   | /ˈxlɔpet͡sʲ/ | boy, guy        | m           |
| дівчина   | /dʲiʋˈt͡ʃɪnɑ/ | girl            | f           |
| друг      | /druh/      | friend (male)   | m           |
| подруга   | /pɔˈdruhɑ/  | friend (female) | f           |

**Notes:**

- «Людина» is grammatically feminine, but refers to any person regardless of gender.
- «Хлопець» can mean «boy» (child) or «guy» (young man), depending on context.
- «Друг/подруга» can mean platonic friend OR romantic partner—context is key!

**Usage examples:**

- Це людина. (This is a person.)
- Він хлопець, вона дівчина. (He's a guy, she's a girl.)
- Це мій друг Іван. (This is my friend Ivan.)
- Це моя подруга Ольга. (This is my friend Olha.)

## Practice

**Pattern Practice: Identity Statements**

Try forming these in your mind:

1. I am a student. → Я студент/студентка.
2. She is a doctor. → Вона лікарка.
3. This is my friend. → Це мій друг / моя подруга.
4. They are Ukrainians. → Вони українці.
5. Are you a professor? → Ти професор? / Ви професор?

Notice: No verb! Just subject + noun.

**Pointing Out People**

Walk around your room (mentally or actually) and practice:

- Це стіл. (This is a table.) [from Module 03]
- Це книга. (This is a book.)
- Це мій друг. (This is my friend—imaginary or real!)

**Politeness Checkpoint**

Who would you use «Ви» with?

- ✅ Your professor
- ✅ A stranger on the street
- ✅ Your friend's grandmother
- ❌ Your classmate
- ❌ Your younger sibling
- ❌ Your pet cat

> ⚡ **Pro Tip**
>
> If someone older or higher-status says «Можна на 'ти'?» (Can we use 'ти'?), they're inviting informality. Say «Так, звичайно!» (Yes, of course!) and switch. But never suggest it yourself to someone older—let them decide.

## Production

**Real-life Task: Introduce Yourself**

Imagine you're at a language exchange in Kyiv. Introduce yourself:

**Model Answer:**

> Привіт! Я [your name]. Я [американець/американка/канадець/канадка/англієць/англійка]. Я студент/студентка. А ти хто?

**Real-life Task: Introduce a Friend**

Point to a friend (real or imaginary) and introduce them:

**Model Answer:**

> Це мій друг [name]. Він [nationality]. Він студент.
> OR
> Це моя подруга [name]. Вона [nationality]. Вона студентка.

**Cultural Scenario: Meeting Your Host Family**

You're doing a homestay in Lviv. You meet your host parents for the first time. What do you say?

**Model Answer:**

> Добрий день! Я [your name]. Я [nationality]. (Good day! I'm [name]. I'm [nationality].)

Use **Ви** for the parents unless they specifically invite you to use **ти**.

## Cultural Insight

### Ukrainian Names and Identity

Ukrainians take names seriously. When introducing yourself, use your first name only among peers. In formal settings, you might hear a patronymic—a middle name from the father's name. For example:

- Анна Петрівна (Anna, daughter of Petro)
- Іван Михайлович (Ivan, son of Mykhailo)

In modern Ukraine, patronymics are used less by young people in casual settings, but they're still standard in official documents and formal contexts. Using someone's first name and patronymic (like «Анна Петрівна») is the highest form of respect.

**National Pride**

Saying «Я українець» or «Я українка» isn't just a statement of nationality—it's an identity many Ukrainians hold with deep pride, especially after centuries of imperial suppression. Ukrainian identity was illegal to express openly during Soviet times. Today, speaking Ukrainian and affirming «Я українець/українка» is a quiet act of cultural resistance and reclamation. It signifies a connection to a land that has fought for its right to exist for generations.

> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** «Ukrainians and Russians are basically the same people.»
> **Fact:** Ukrainians are a distinct East Slavic nation with their own language (closer to Polish than Russian), culture, history, and identity. Saying «Я українець» affirms this distinctness. Respect it!

# Підсумок

**What You Learned:**

- ✅ Personal pronouns: я, ти, він, вона, воно, ми, ви, вони
- ✅ Zero copula: no «am/is/are» in present tense (Я студент, not Я є студент)
- ✅ Using «це» to point out people and things
- ✅ Masculine/feminine forms of nationalities and professions
- ✅ When to use «ти» (informal) vs «Ви» (formal/plural)

**You Can Now:**

- Introduce yourself: Я [name]. Я [nationality/profession].
- Introduce others: Це мій друг. Він студент.
- Ask someone's identity: Ти хто? Ви студент?
- Show respect by choosing the right «you»

**Next Steps:**

In Module 05, you'll learn demonstratives (цей, ця, це, ці) to be even more specific about pointing out objects. But first, solidify this module—practice introducing yourself and imaginary friends until it feels natural!

## State Standard 2024 References

### §4.3.1 — Personal Pronouns (Особові займенники)

Ukrainian personal pronouns: я, ти, він, вона, воно, ми, ви, вони.
- Second person formal/plural distinction: ти (singular informal) vs ви (plural or formal singular)
- Ви is capitalized when addressing a single person formally (Ви, Ваш, Вам)
- Third person pronouns correspond to noun gender: він (m.), вона (f.), воно (n.)

### §4.5.1 — Zero Copula (Нульова зв'язка)

In Ukrainian present tense, the copula «бути» is omitted (zero copula):
- Я студент. (I am a student.) — no linking verb
- Це книга. (This is a book.) — demonstrative + noun
- Він лікар. (He is a doctor.) — pronoun + noun

The form «є» exists but is restricted to:
- Emphatic contexts: Київ є столиця. (Kyiv IS the capital.)
- Written/formal register
- Mathematical/logical statements

### §4.3.4 — Demonstrative Pronouns

«Це» functions as:
- Demonstrative pronoun: Це книга. (This is a book.)
- Invariable for number: Це студенти. (These are students.)
- Used for identification: Це Марко. (This is Marko.)

## Cultural Hooks

### Hook 1: Ви/Ти Politeness System (Verified)

The ви/ти distinction is active in modern Ukrainian society:
- Young people (under 30) increasingly use ти immediately with peers
- Formal ви is mandatory for: authority figures, elders, strangers, service situations
- The phrase «Можна на 'ти'?» is the standard invitation to switch to informal address
- Ви is capitalized in written address (letters, emails) when addressing one person

### Hook 2: Groot's Ukrainian Grammar (Verified)

In the Ukrainian dub of Guardians of the Galaxy (Вартові Галактики), Groot's line «Я Ґрут» is grammatically perfect Ukrainian zero copula. The dubbed film used the Ukrainian letter Ґ for Groot.

### Hook 3: Ukrainian Names and Patronymics (Verified)

Ukrainian naming tradition uses three-part names:
- Ім'я (first name): Анна, Іван
- По батькові (patronymic): Петрівна (daughter of Петро), Михайлович (son of Михайло)
- Прізвище (surname)
Patronymics are declining in informal use among young people but remain standard in official documents.

## Key Vocabulary Frequency Notes

High-frequency items (all top-1000 in ULIF corpus):
- я, ти, він, вона, ми, ви, вони — top-50 frequency
- це — top-30 frequency
- хто, що — top-100 frequency
- людина, чоловік, жінка — top-500 frequency
- друг, подруга — top-1000 frequency

- **Prepares for:** M05 (My World: Objects — demonstratives цей/ця/це/ці), M14 (Mine and Yours — possessive pronouns)
`

**Do not proceed until you have read every line of the content and every activity item.**

> **ANTI-STALE-REVIEW RULE**: This file may have been fixed since a previous review. You MUST review the CURRENT state of the files, not repeat findings from a prior review. If an issue was cited before but is now fixed, it must NOT appear in your review. Every finding must be verifiable by quoting the actual current content.

## STEP 1: PLAN VERIFICATION

Cross-check content against the plan file:

1. **Outline compliance**: Is every section from `content_outline` present as an H2/H3?
2. **Vocabulary scope**: List every Ukrainian vocabulary word taught in the content. Compare against `vocabulary_hints.required` in the plan. Flag any word NOT in the plan.
3. **Grammar scope**: What grammar does this module teach? What grammar from LATER modules appears in examples or dialogues? (This is scope creep — flag it.)
4. **Objectives**: Are all learning objectives from the plan addressed in the content?

Report findings as:
```
Plan-Content Alignment: [PASS/FAIL]
- Sections: [all present / missing: X, Y]
- Vocabulary: [X/Y from plan used, Z extra words found]
- Grammar scope: [clean / scope creep: specific items]
- Objectives: [all covered / missing: X]
```

---

## STEP 2: DEEP VERIFICATION (Line by Line)

### Ukrainian Sentences
Go through the file section by section. For EACH Ukrainian sentence:
- Is grammar correct? (cases, verb forms, agreement)
- Does it sound natural? (not robotic, not calqued from English)
- Are there Russianisms? (check against list below)
- Is vocabulary appropriate for the level?

### English Sentences
- Is it clear and accessible?
- Warm tutor voice or cold textbook?
- Over-explaining simple things? Under-explaining complex ones?

### IPA Transcriptions (if present)
- Every transcription must be checked for correct stress placement
- Ukrainian stress is unpredictable — verify each one
- Watch for English approximations instead of Ukrainian phonemes

### Activities (EVERY ITEM)

**CRITICAL: Read the actual YAML file line by line.** Do NOT assume what the file contains — read it. If a previous review said "add English cues" but the file already has them, acknowledge the fix is present. Never cite an issue that doesn't exist in the CURRENT file.

Check each activity item individually:
- **quiz**: Grammatically correct? Exactly one correct answer? Options plausible?
- **fill-in**: Sentence correct with answer filled in? Only ONE valid answer given the context/cues? Distractors plausible?
- **match-up**: All pairs correct? No duplicates?
- **true-false**: True statements actually true? False clearly false?
- **unjumble**: Answer forms a correct, natural sentence?
- **group-sort**: Items correctly categorized?
- **anagram**: Solution correct? Hint clear?

Count as you go. You MUST report how many items you checked.

**Verification rule**: For EVERY issue you cite, quote the EXACT line from the file. If you cannot quote it, the issue does not exist.

## STEP 3: AUTO-FAIL CHECKLIST

Check EVERY category. Report "[CLEAN]" or list specific findings.

### Russianisms
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| кушать | їсти |
| приймати участь | брати участь |
| самий кращий | найкращий |
| слідуючий | наступний |
| на протязі | протягом |
| любий (any) | будь-який |
| отвічати | відповідати |
| вообще | взагалі |
| получати | отримувати |
| відноситися | ставитися |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Calques
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| робити сенс | мати сенс |
| брати місце | відбуватися |
| це є | це (usually) |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Grammar Scope Violations
At module 4, students know ONLY modules 1-3. Any grammar from later modules is scope creep.
- Past tense (if not yet taught)
- Cases not yet introduced
- Verb forms not yet taught

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list specific violations with line numbers]

### Activity Errors
- Wrong answer marked as correct
- Multiple valid answers but only one accepted
- Grammatically incorrect sentences
- Duplicate items

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with activity number and item number]

### Beginner Safety ("Would I Continue?" Test)
| Question | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Did I feel overwhelmed? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Were instructions clear? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Did I get quick wins? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Was Ukrainian scary? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Would I come back tomorrow? | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Total** | **X/5** |

Emotional beats found:
- Welcome/orientation: [yes/no, where]
- Curiosity trigger: [yes/no, where]
- Quick wins: [count, where]
- Encouragement: [count, where]
- Progress marker: [yes/no, where]

---

## STEP 4: SCORE DIMENSIONS

**Score ONLY after completing Steps 1-3.** Each score must link to specific findings.

### Scoring Rules
- **9-10**: Excellent — no issues found in this dimension
- **7-8**: Good — minor issues found
- **5-6**: Needs work — multiple issues
- **<5**: Serious problems — major rewrite needed
- **If you found 3 grammar errors, Language cannot be 9**
- **If scope creep found, Relevance and Pedagogy cannot be 8+**

### Auto-Fail Thresholds
| Dimension | Auto-fail if below |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Experience Quality | <7 |
| Coherence | <7 |
| Relevance | <7 |
| Educational | <7 |
| Language | <8 |
| Pedagogy | <7 |
| Immersion | <6 |
| Activities | <7 |
| Richness | <6 |
| Beginner Safety | <7 |
| LLM Fingerprint | <7 |
| Linguistic Accuracy | <9 |

### Weighted Overall Score
```
Overall = (Experience × 1.5 + Coherence × 1.0 + Relevance × 1.0 + Educational × 1.2 +
          Language × 1.1 + Pedagogy × 1.2 + Immersion × 1.0 + Activities × 1.3 +
          Richness × 0.9 + Beginner_Safety × 1.3 + LLM × 1.0 + Linguistic_Accuracy × 1.5) / 14.0
```

**Quality target: 9.0+ overall AND no dimension below its auto-fail threshold.**
**If the score is below 9.0, you MUST provide a Fix Plan (see output format) with specific actions to reach 9/10.** The fix plan drives the iteration loop — Claude will send fixes to Gemini until the module reaches 9.0+.

## Fix Plan to Reach 9/10 (REQUIRED if score < 9.0)

For EACH dimension scoring below 9, provide a concrete action plan:

### {Dimension Name}: {current}/10 → 9/10

**What to fix:**
1. Line {N}: Change "{current text}" → "{replacement text}" — {why this raises the score}
2. Section "{name}": {specific action} — {expected impact}
3. ...

**Expected score after fix:** {X}/10

[Repeat for every dimension below 9. Be specific — line numbers, exact replacements, section names.]

## Boundaries

- Do NOT modify any files OTHER than the output file
- Do NOT score generously — honesty prevents bad curriculum
- Do NOT skip any step or dimension
- Do NOT fabricate issues — every critique must cite a specific line number
- Do NOT give vague feedback like "could be improved" — say exactly what and where
