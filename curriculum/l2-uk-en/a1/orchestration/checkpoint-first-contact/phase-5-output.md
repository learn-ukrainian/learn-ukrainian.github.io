|---|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Experience Quality | 10/10 | <7 | Welcoming tone, clear structure, encouraging self-checks. |
| 2 | Coherence | 10/10 | <7 | Logical flow from alphabet to complex dialogue. |

| 5 | Language | 9/10 | <8 | "Латте" should be "лате" (2019 spelling rule for loanwords). |

| 7 | Immersion | 10/10 | <6 | Appropriate for a Checkpoint (Meta-heavy, but examples are target language). |

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Spelling (Loanwords)
- **Location**: Line 139 (Content) and Vocab File
- **Original**: "Американо чи **латте**?"
- **Problem**: In standard Ukrainian (2019 Rechtschreibung), general loanwords do not double consonants (e.g., *капучино*, *паста*). "Latte" follows this rule → **лате**.
- **Fix**: Change "латте" to "лате" in both `10-checkpoint-first-contact.md` and `vocabulary/10-checkpoint-first-contact.yaml`. Update IPA in vocab to `/lˈatɛ/`.

### Issue 2: Plan Alignment (Minor)
- **Location**: Skill 5: Замовлення їжі
- **Original**: Only teaches "Каву, будь ласка."
- **Problem**: Plan explicitly requested: "Фрази для кафе (Можна мені...?, Я хочу...)".
- **Fix**: Add "Можна каву?" (Can I have coffee?) to the **Key Phrases** list in Skill 5 to satisfy the plan and give a slightly more polite option.

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| 139 | латте | лате | Spelling |

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test: 5/5
- Overwhelmed? [No]
- Instructions clear? [Yes]
- Quick wins? [Yes - "I can read the menu!"]
- Ukrainian scary? [No]
- Come back tomorrow? [Yes]

Emotional beats:
- Welcome: Yes ("Congratulations!")
- Curiosity: Yes ("Pop Culture Moment")
- Quick wins: 5 sections of checks.
- Encouragement: "Mastery at this stage will make everything that follows much easier!"

## Strengths
- **Self-Checks**: The bulleted self-checks at the end of each skill are excellent for learner autonomy.
- **Volume**: The activity file is massive and thorough.
- **Clarity**: Explanations of "Gender Pattern" and "Verb Classes" are simplified perfectly for A1.

## Fix Plan to Reach 10/10

### Language: 9/10 → 10/10
**What to fix:**
1. **Content Line 139**: Change "латте" to "лате".
2. **Vocab File**: Change `lemma: латте` to `lemma: лате` and `ipa: /lˈattɛ/` to `ipa: /lˈatɛ/`.

### Relevance: 9/10 → 10/10
**What to fix:**
1. **Content Section "Skill 5"**: Under **Key Phrases**, add:
   - `**Можна каву?** = Can I have coffee?`
   - `**Я буду чай.** = I'll have tea.` (Optional, but "Можна" covers the polite request requirement).

## Verdict

**PASS**

Excellent checkpoint module. Only requires a minor spelling fix ("лате") and a small addition to the key phrases to fully align with the plan.
