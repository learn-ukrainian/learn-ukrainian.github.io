# Checkpoint - First Contact

## Overview

Congratulations! You have reached your first Checkpoint in the Ukrainian language journey. Over the last nine modules, you have built a solid foundation, moving from the mysterious symbols of the Cyrillic alphabet to ordering food in a cafe and describing your daily life. This module is designed to help you consolidate everything you've learned and verify that you are ready to move on to the next phase: The Cases.

In this Checkpoint, we will review:
1. **The Cyrillic Code**: Mastering the sounds and letters.
2. **Gender and Agreement**: Identifying masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns.
3. **The Living Verb**: Conjugating in the Present Tense (First and Second groups).
4. **Questions and Negation**: Building real conversations.
5. **Practical Survival**: Navigating greetings and food.

Take your time with the exercises. If you find a par
...
день! Що ви бажаєте?
> — Каву, будь ласка.
> — Американо чи латте?
> — Американо.
> — Ще щось?
> — Так, вареники.
> — Смачного!

*(Good day! What would you like? / Coffee, please. / Americano or latte? / Americano. / Anything else? / Yes, varenyky. / Enjoy your meal!)*

**Key Phrases:**

- **Що ви бажаєте?** = What would you like?
- **будь ласка** = please
- **Ще щось?** = Anything else?
- **Смачного!** = Bon appétit!

### Practice: Complete the Order

Fill in the customer's responses:

— Добрий день! Що ви бажаєте?
— **\_**, будь ласка. (order tea)
— Чорний чи зелений?
— **\_** (black)
— Ще щось?
— Ні, **\_** (thank you)

> [!solution] Перевірити (Check)
> — Чай, будь ласка.
> — Чорний.
> — Ні, дякую.

### Self-Check

- Can you say **Смачного!** when someone starts eating?
- Do you know basic food words? (борщ, хліб, вода, молоко)
- Can you politely decline? (Ні, дякую.)

> 🌍 **Real World Tip**
>
> In Ukraine, the waiter might ask **«Чай чи кава?»** (Tea or coffee?). After this checkpoint, you'll understand and answer confidently!

## Integration Task

**Read this text, then answer the questions.**

> Привіт! Я Марко. Я студент. Я живу в Києві. Це моя кімната. Тут є стіл, книга і кава. Я читаю текст українською. Я люблю український борщ! А ти? Що ти любиш?

**Questions:**

1. What gender is **книга**? How do you know?
2. What verb form is **читаю**? What person?
3. What question does Марко ask at the end?
4. If you want to ask «Where does Марко live?», what question word do you use?

> [!solution] Перевірити (Check)
>
> 1. Feminine — ends in -а
> 2. читаю = «I read» — 1st person singular of читати (First Conjugation)
