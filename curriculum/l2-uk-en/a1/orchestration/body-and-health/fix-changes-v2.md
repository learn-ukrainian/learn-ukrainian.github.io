## Applied Fixes

1. [File: content] Section "Body Part + Болить/Болять": Added row for "рука/руки" — Addresses Issue 1 (Missing Required Vocabulary)
2. [File: content] Section "Body Part + Болить/Болять": Corrected IPA for "спина" (changed from /spɪˈnɑ/ to /ˈspɪnɑ/) — Addresses Issue 3 (Incorrect IPA Stress)
3. [File: activities] Activity "Body Parts" (Group-sort), Group "Кінцівки": Removed "палець" and "коліно" — Addresses Issue 2 (Activity Vocabulary Scope Creep)

## Fixes NOT Applied

- Vocabulary file: Not updated because the "Fix Plan to Reach 9/10" section only specified changes to the content and activities files, even though the plan verification noted "рука" was missing from "content".

## Files Changed: content, activities
## Files Unchanged: vocabulary
