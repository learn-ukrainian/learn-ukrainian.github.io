## Applied Fixes

1. [File: content] Section "Body Part + Болить/Болять", Row "спина": Fixed IPA stress from `/spɪˈnɑ/` to `/ˈspɪnɑ/` — addresses "Incorrect IPA Stress".
2. [File: content] Section "Body Part + Болить/Болять": Added new row for "рука/руки" (`| рука болить | /ˈrukɑ bɔˈlɪtʲ/ | руки болять | /ˈrukɪ bɔˈlʲɑtʲ/ |`) — addresses "Missing Required Vocabulary".

## Fixes NOT Applied

- [File: activities] Activity 3 "Body Parts" (Group-sort): The items "палець" and "коліно" were NOT found in the provided activities file (`a1/activities/31-body-and-health.yaml`). The activity currently contains only "руки" and "ноги" in the "Кінцівки" group. Since the items are already absent, no changes were made to the file. Note: "пальці" (plural) exists in Activity 4, but the Fix Plan specifically targeted Activity 3 and the singular forms.

## Files Changed: content
## Files Unchanged: activities, vocabulary
