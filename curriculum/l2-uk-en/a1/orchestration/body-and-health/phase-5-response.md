## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Missing Required Vocabulary
- **Location**: Content (entire file) vs Plan
- **Original**: (Missing)
- **Problem**: The word "рука" (arm/hand) is listed in the Plan as Required Vocabulary and used in Activity 1, but it is **not taught** in any content table, list, or example sentence.
- **Fix**: Add "рука" to the "Body Part + Болить/Болять" table or the "Singular Pain" example block.

### Issue 2: Activity Vocabulary Scope Creep
- **Location**: Activity 3 (Group-sort: Body Parts), Group "Кінцівки"
- **Original**: "items: - руки - ноги - палець - коліно"
- **Problem**: "Палець" (finger/toe) and "Коліно" (knee) are not taught in the content, not in the vocabulary list, and not in the plan. Students cannot know these.
- **Fix**: Remove "палець" and "коліно" from the activity items.

### Issue 3: Incorrect IPA Stress
- **Location**: Section "Body Part + Болить/Болять", Row "спина"
- **Original**: `/spɪˈnɑ bɔˈlɪtʲ/`
- **Problem**: The standard stress for "спина" is on the first syllable (`спИна`), not the second (`спинА`). While `спинА` exists in dialects, A1 learners should learn the standard `спИна`.
- **Fix**: Change IPA to `/ˈspɪnɑ bɔˈlɪtʲ/`.

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test: 5/5
- Overwhelmed? [Pass]
- Instructions clear? [Pass]
- Quick wins? [Pass] (Pain formula is simple and empowering)
- Ukrainian scary? [Pass]
- Come back tomorrow? [Pass]

Emotional beats: 5 found
- Welcome: "Don't worry, you've got this!" (Warm-up)
- Curiosity: "This is a very interesting grammatical structure..." (Warm-up)
- Quick wins: "It's simpler than it looks!" (Pain Formula)
- Encouragement: "Don't be afraid to point..." (Myth vs Fact)
- Progress: "Wow! You've mastered the basics..." (Summary)

## Strengths
- **Cultural Context**: The "Народна медицина" (tea + raspberry) note is excellent cultural immersion.
- **Grammar Explanation**: The distinction between "болить" (singular) and "болять" (plural) is explained clearly without overwhelming terminology.
- **Practicality**: The "Pharmacy" and "Ambulance" dialogues are high-value survival content.

## Fix Plan to Reach 9/10

### Educational / Pedagogy: 8/10 → 10/10

**What to fix:**
1.  **Section "Body Part + Болить/Болять"**: Add a row for "Arm/Hand".
    *   Add: `| рука болить | /ˈrukɑ bɔˈlɪtʲ/ | руки болять | /ˈrukɪ bɔˈlʲɑtʲ/ |`
    *   *Impact*: Ensures required vocabulary is taught before testing.

2.  **Section "Presentation"**: Correct IPA for "спина".
    *   Change: `/spɪˈnɑ bɔˈlɪtʲ/` → `/ˈspɪnɑ bɔˈlɪtʲ/`.
    *   *Impact*: Ensures linguistic accuracy.

### Activities: 8/10 → 10/10

**What to fix:**
1.  **File `activities/31-body-and-health.yaml`**: Edit Activity 3 (Group-sort).
    *   Remove: `- палець` and `- коліно`.
    *   *Impact*: Removes scope creep; ensures student success.

### Projected Overall After Fixes

With these fixes, Educational, Pedagogy, and Activities scores rise to 10/10. Linguistic Accuracy rises to 10/10.
Projected Score: **9.8/10**.

## Verdict

**FAIL**

The module is excellent in tone and structure but fails on strict pedagogical alignment: it tests vocabulary ("палець", "коліно") that it never teaches, and it fails to teach a required word ("рука") that it tests. These are easy fixes that will bring the module to a near-perfect score.
