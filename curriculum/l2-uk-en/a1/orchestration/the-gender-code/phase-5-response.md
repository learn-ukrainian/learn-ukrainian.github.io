## Critical Issues Found

No critical blocking issues found.

### Non-Critical Note: Vocabulary Alignment
- **Location**: Vocabulary
- **Original**: Missing `брат`, `сестра`, `тато` (from Plan).
- **Problem**: Plan requires family members; module focuses on objects/furniture.
- **Fix**: Acceptable deviation. Including `тато` (masculine ending in -о) might confuse the "95% rule" at this stage.

Emotional beats: 5 found
- Welcome: "Think of it like a secret code" (Intro)
- Curiosity: "S.T.A.L.K.E.R." (Presentation)
- Quick wins: "Excellent! You've just analyzed 6 nouns" (Production)
- Encouragement: "You've unlocked the Ukrainian Gender Code!" (Summary)

## Strengths
- **Cultural Integration**: Using S.T.A.L.K.E.R. to teach gender (Прип'ять - f, місто - n, будинок - m) is brilliant targeting.
- **Pedagogical Depth**: Introducing the *concept* of Declension Families (I-IV) early, without forcing rote memorization, sets a perfect foundation for B1.
- **Visual Clarity**: Tables are clear and examples are high-frequency.

## Verdict

**PASS**

This module is an exemplary A1 lesson. It turns a dry grammatical concept (gender) into a "secret code" game. The integration of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and folklore provides high richness. The deviation from the vocabulary plan (omitting tricky family terms like *тато*) appears to be a deliberate and wise pedagogical choice to maintain the clarity of the "-о = neuter" rule for beginners.
