## Warm-up

Have you ever wondered why some languages assign gender to objects? In Ukrainian, **every noun has a gender** — masculine, feminine, or neuter. But it's not random! Ukrainian gives you **visible clues** right in the word's ending.

Think of it like a secret code: the last letter reveals the gender. And once you crack the code, you'll never forget it.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian noun gender is more predictable than German or French! In Ukrainian, **95% of the time**, you can guess the gender just by looking at the ending. No memorization needed — just pattern recognition.

## Presentation

### The Three Genders

Ukrainian nouns fall into three gender categories, and each has a signature ending:

| Gender        | Ending Pattern               | Examples                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Masculine** | Consonant (б, т, л, н, р...) | стіл (table), хліб (bread), дім (house)     |
| **Feminine**  | **-а** or **-я**             | книга (book), кімната (room), земля (earth) |
| **Neuter**    | **-о** or **-е**             | вікно (window), місто (city), море (sea)    |

This is your **foundational pattern**. Memorize it once, and you'll recognize thousands of words.

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.**
>
> In the iconic Ukrainian game *S.T.A.L.K.E.R.*, you explore locations like **Прип'ять** (Prypiat — feminine, ends in soft sign), **місто** (city — neuter, ends in -о), and **будинок** (building — masculine, consonant ending). Even in post-apocalyptic Ukraine, grammar survives!

### Why Gender Matters

You might think: «Why do I need to know if a table is masculine?»

Because in Ukrainian, **gender affects everything**:

- Adjectives change endings to match: **новий стіл** (new table, m) vs **нова книга** (new book, f)
- Pronouns refer back by gender: **він** (he/it, for masculine nouns), **вона** (she/it, feminine), **воно** (it, neuter)
- Case endings (accusative, locative, etc.) depend on gender

**Gender is the foundation of Ukrainian grammar.** Get it right now, and the rest will flow naturally.

### Mini-Dialogue: At Home

**Марко:** Де моя **книга**? (Where is my book?)
**Таня:** Твоя **книга** на **столі**. (Your book is on the table.)
**Марко:** А де **вікно**? (And where is the window?)
**Таня:** **Вікно** там. (The window is there.)

Notice:

- **книга** (book, feminine) — ends in **-а**
- **стіл** (table, masculine) — ends in consonant **-л**
- **вікно** (window, neuter) — ends in **-о**

Every noun in this dialogue follows the pattern.

> 🌍 **Real World: Ukrainian Home Vocabulary**
>
> When Ukrainians describe their home, they naturally use all three genders:
>
> - **Кімната** (room — f), **підлога** (floor — f), **стеля** (ceiling — f)
> - **Стіл** (table — m), **стілець** (chair — m), **диван** (sofa — m)
> - **Вікно** (window — n), **ліжко** (bed — n), **крісло** (armchair — n)
>
> Practice these words, and you'll describe any Ukrainian apartment!

## Practice

### The 4 Declension Families (Відміни)

Now here's where it gets smart. Ukrainian doesn't just have 3 genders — it organizes nouns into **4 declension families** based on how they change in different cases (accusative, locative, etc.).

You don't need to memorize case endings yet. But recognizing the **family pattern** now will save you months of confusion later.

| Family       | Definition                                                            | Examples                                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Family 1** | Nouns ending in **-а** or **-я** (mostly feminine)                    | мама (mom), земля (earth), кімната (room) |
| **Family 2** | Masculine consonant endings + Neuter **-о/-е**                        | стіл (m), вікно (n), море (n)             |
| **Family 3** | Feminine nouns ending in **consonant** (rare but important)           | ніч (night), любов (love)                 |
| **Family 4** | Neuter nouns ending in **-а/-я** with stem changes **-ат-/-ят-/-ен-** | ім'я (name → імені), теля (calf → теляти) |

**Key Insight:** Family 1 and Family 2 cover **90% of Ukrainian nouns**. Family 3 and Family 4 are smaller but essential for advanced fluency.

For now, focus on recognizing the **ending pattern**. Later modules will teach how each family changes in different cases.

> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** «All feminine nouns end in -а or -я.»
> **Fact:** Most do (Family 1), but Family 3 feminines end in **consonants** like **ніч** (night) and **любов** (love). These are essential words — don't skip them!

### Common Patterns to Memorize

**Masculine (-consonant):**

- Food: хліб (bread), сир (cheese), сік (juice)
- Places: дім (house), магазин (store), університет (university)
- Furniture: стіл (table), стілець (chair), диван (sofa)

**Feminine (-а/-я):**

- Rooms: кімната (room), школа (school)
- Food: вода (water), картопля (potato), цибуля (onion)
- Furniture: шафа (wardrobe)

**Neuter (-о/-е):**

- Places: місто (city), село (village), море (sea)
- Objects: вікно (window), яблуко (apple), м'ясо (meat)
- Furniture: ліжко (bed), крісло (armchair)

### Mini-Dialogue: At the Market

**Марія:** Хліб, молоко і вода, будь ласка.
**Продавець:** Яблуко теж?
**Марія:** Так, картопля і апельсин.

See how gender flows naturally in conversation? You're not translating — you're **thinking in Ukrainian patterns**.

> 🎯 **Pro Tip: The -о/-е Neuter Trick**
>
> Almost **all food words ending in -о or -е are neuter**: молоко (milk), яйце (egg), яблуко (apple), м'ясо (meat), вино (wine).
>
> Watch out: **овоч** (vegetable) and **фрукт** (fruit) are masculine — they end in consonants!

## Production

Now it's your turn! Practice identifying gender and families.

**Task 1:** Read these words aloud and identify their gender:

1. Двері (door) — ?
2. Річка (river) — ?
3. Море (sea) — ?
4. Хліб (bread) — ?

> [!answer]
>
> 1. Двері — plural only (no gender)
> 2. Річка — feminine (-а)
> 3. Море — neuter (-е)
> 4. Хліб — masculine (consonant)

**Task 2:** Sort these words into declension families:

- Стіна, вікно, підлога, стіл, крісло, шафа

> [!answer]
> Family 1: стіна, підлога, шафа.
>
> Family 2: стіл, вікно, крісло.

Excellent! You've just analyzed 6 nouns like a linguist.

## Cultural Insight

### Why Ukrainian Gender Patterns Are Elegant

Unlike English (which mostly lost grammatical gender), Ukrainian preserves a **transparent gender system**. You don't need to memorize arbitrary labels — the word itself tells you.

Compare:

- **German:** *der Tisch* (m), *die Tür* (f), *das Fenster* (n) — you must memorize articles.
- **Ukrainian:** стіл (ends in consonant = m), двері (plural only), вікно (ends in -о = n) — the ending IS the clue!

This pattern consistency makes Ukrainian **easier to learn** than languages with hidden gender markers.

> 🎭 **Folklore Corner: Gendered Personification**
>
> In Ukrainian folk songs and poetry, **nature is personified by gender**:
>
> - **Земля** (earth — feminine) is often called «mother» (Земля-матінка).
> - **Місяць** (moon — masculine) is portrayed as a protector or wanderer.
> - **Сонце** (sun — neuter) represents life and warmth without gender.
>
> Gender isn't just grammar — it shapes how Ukrainians see the world!

# Підсумок

**You've unlocked the Ukrainian Gender Code!**

**Three Genders:**

- Masculine: consonant ending (стіл, хліб, дім)
- Feminine: -а/-я (книга, кімната, земля)
- Neuter: -о/-е (вікно, місто, море)

**Four Declension Families:**

1. -а/-я feminines (мама, земля)
2. Consonant masculines + -о/-е neuters (стіл, вікно)
3. Soft -ь feminines (ніч, любов)
4. -а neuters with stem changes (ім'я, теля)

**Why It Matters:**
Gender affects adjectives, pronouns, and case endings. Master gender now, and everything else becomes easier.

**Next Module:** You'll learn how to say «This is...» and use pronouns — building on the gender foundation you just mastered.

6. **Research notes** (if exists): `# Research Notes: M03 — The Gender Code

**Level:** A1 | **Module:** 03
**Research Date:** 2026-02-07
**Researcher:** Claude (review-content-core-a v1.0)

## State Standard 2024 References

### §4.2.1 — Noun Categories (Рід іменника)

Ukrainian nouns have three grammatical genders:
- **Чоловічий рід** (masculine): nouns ending in a consonant, -о (rare: батько, Дніпро)
- **Жіночий рід** (feminine): nouns ending in -а/-я, or consonant (3rd declension)
- **Середній рід** (neuter): nouns ending in -о/-е/-я (4th declension: ім'я, теля)

Gender is determined by morphological ending, with ~95% predictability.

### §4.2.2 — Declension System (Відміни)

Four declension families (відміни):
1. **Перша відміна** (1st declension): nouns ending in -а/-я — mostly feminine, includes some masculine (суддя, Микола)
2. **Друга відміна** (2nd declension): masculine consonant + neuter -о/-е — the largest family
3. **Третя відміна** (3rd declension): feminine consonant endings — small but important group (ніч, любов, сіль, подорож)
4. **Четверта відміна** (4th declension): neuter nouns with stem alternations -ат-/-ят-/-ен- (ім'я → імені, теля → теляти, курча → курчати)

### §4.2.3 — Gender Agreement

Gender determines:
- Adjective agreement (новий стіл m, нова книга f, нове вікно n)
- Pronoun reference (він, вона, воно)
- Past tense verb agreement (він читав, вона читала, воно стояло)
- Case ending patterns differ by gender and declension family

## Cultural Hooks

### Hook 1: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Game Series (Verified)

The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. video game series (2007-2024) was developed by Ukrainian studio GSC Game World based in Kyiv. The games are set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl was released in November 2024 and includes full Ukrainian voice acting. The game features locations like Прип'ять (Pripyat, f.), місто (city, n.), будинок (building, m.) — showcasing all three genders.

### Hook 2: Ukrainian Folklore — Gendered Personification (Verified)

In Ukrainian folk tradition and poetry:
- **Земля** (earth, f.) is personified as mother — «Земля-матінка» (Mother Earth)
- **Місяць** (moon, m.) is personified as a male wanderer/protector in folk songs
- **Сонце** (sun, n.) represents life and warmth without gendered personification

This reflects how grammatical gender shapes cultural perception in Ukrainian worldview. Taras Shevchenko frequently used gendered personification in his poetry.

## Key Vocabulary Frequency Notes

High-frequency nouns used in module (all verified in ULIF corpus):
- стіл, книга, вікно — top-500 frequency
- дім, місто, вода — top-200 frequency
- хліб, молоко, море — top-1000 frequency
- ніч, любов — top-500 frequency (important 3rd declension examples)

## Cross-References

- **Builds on:** M01-M02 (Cyrillic alphabet — learner can now read all examples)
- **Prepares for:** M04 (This Is, I Am — pronouns reference gender), M26 (Adjectives — gender agreement in detail)
- **Key connection:** Gender is the foundation for all case endings (M11-M16)
`

**Do not proceed until you have read every line of the content and every activity item.**

> **ANTI-STALE-REVIEW RULE**: This file may have been fixed since a previous review. You MUST review the CURRENT state of the files, not repeat findings from a prior review. If an issue was cited before but is now fixed, it must NOT appear in your review. Every finding must be verifiable by quoting the actual current content.

## Audit Metrics (Facts from Claude)

```

## STEP 1: PLAN VERIFICATION

Cross-check content against the plan file:

1. **Outline compliance**: Is every section from `content_outline` present as an H2/H3?
2. **Vocabulary scope**: List every Ukrainian vocabulary word taught in the content. Compare against `vocabulary_hints.required` in the plan. Flag any word NOT in the plan.
3. **Grammar scope**: What grammar does this module teach? What grammar from LATER modules appears in examples or dialogues? (This is scope creep — flag it.)
4. **Objectives**: Are all learning objectives from the plan addressed in the content?

Report findings as:
```
Plan-Content Alignment: [PASS/FAIL]
- Sections: [all present / missing: X, Y]
- Vocabulary: [X/Y from plan used, Z extra words found]
- Grammar scope: [clean / scope creep: specific items]
- Objectives: [all covered / missing: X]
```

---

## STEP 2: DEEP VERIFICATION (Line by Line)

### Ukrainian Sentences
Go through the file section by section. For EACH Ukrainian sentence:
- Is grammar correct? (cases, verb forms, agreement)
- Does it sound natural? (not robotic, not calqued from English)
- Are there Russianisms? (check against list below)
- Is vocabulary appropriate for the level?

### English Sentences
- Is it clear and accessible?
- Warm tutor voice or cold textbook?
- Over-explaining simple things? Under-explaining complex ones?

### IPA Transcriptions (if present)
- Every transcription must be checked for correct stress placement
- Ukrainian stress is unpredictable — verify each one
- Watch for English approximations instead of Ukrainian phonemes

### Activities (EVERY ITEM)

**CRITICAL: Read the actual YAML file line by line.** Do NOT assume what the file contains — read it. If a previous review said "add English cues" but the file already has them, acknowledge the fix is present. Never cite an issue that doesn't exist in the CURRENT file.

Check each activity item individually:
- **quiz**: Grammatically correct? Exactly one correct answer? Options plausible?
- **fill-in**: Sentence correct with answer filled in? Only ONE valid answer given the context/cues? Distractors plausible?
- **match-up**: All pairs correct? No duplicates?
- **true-false**: True statements actually true? False clearly false?
- **unjumble**: Answer forms a correct, natural sentence?
- **group-sort**: Items correctly categorized?
- **anagram**: Solution correct? Hint clear?

Count as you go. You MUST report how many items you checked.

**Verification rule**: For EVERY issue you cite, quote the EXACT line from the file. If you cannot quote it, the issue does not exist.

---

## STEP 3: AUTO-FAIL CHECKLIST

Check EVERY category. Report "[CLEAN]" or list specific findings.

### Russianisms
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| кушать | їсти |
| приймати участь | брати участь |
| самий кращий | найкращий |
| слідуючий | наступний |
| на протязі | протягом |
| любий (any) | будь-який |
| отвічати | відповідати |
| вообще | взагалі |
| получати | отримувати |
| відноситися | ставитися |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Calques
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| робити сенс | мати сенс |
| брати місце | відбуватися |
| це є | це (usually) |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Grammar Scope Violations
At module 3, students know ONLY modules 1-2. Any grammar from later modules is scope creep.
- Past tense (if not yet taught)
- Cases not yet introduced
- Verb forms not yet taught

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list specific violations with line numbers]

### Activity Errors
- Wrong answer marked as correct
- Multiple valid answers but only one accepted
- Grammatically incorrect sentences
- Duplicate items

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with activity number and item number]

### Beginner Safety ("Would I Continue?" Test)
| Question | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Did I feel overwhelmed? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Were instructions clear? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Did I get quick wins? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Was Ukrainian scary? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Would I come back tomorrow? | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Total** | **X/5** |

Emotional beats found:
- Welcome/orientation: [yes/no, where]
- Curiosity trigger: [yes/no, where]
- Quick wins: [count, where]
- Encouragement: [count, where]
- Progress marker: [yes/no, where]

## STEP 4: SCORE DIMENSIONS

**Score ONLY after completing Steps 1-3.** Each score must link to specific findings.

### Scoring Rules
- **9-10**: Excellent — no issues found in this dimension
- **7-8**: Good — minor issues found
- **5-6**: Needs work — multiple issues
- **<5**: Serious problems — major rewrite needed
- **If you found 3 grammar errors, Language cannot be 9**
- **If scope creep found, Relevance and Pedagogy cannot be 8+**

### Auto-Fail Thresholds
| Dimension | Auto-fail if below |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Experience Quality | <7 |
| Coherence | <7 |
| Relevance | <7 |
| Educational | <7 |
| Language | <8 |
| Pedagogy | <7 |
| Immersion | <6 |
| Activities | <7 |
| Richness | <6 |
| Beginner Safety | <7 |
| LLM Fingerprint | <7 |
| Linguistic Accuracy | <9 |

### Weighted Overall Score
```
Overall = (Experience × 1.5 + Coherence × 1.0 + Relevance × 1.0 + Educational × 1.2 +
          Language × 1.1 + Pedagogy × 1.2 + Immersion × 1.0 + Activities × 1.3 +
          Richness × 0.9 + Beginner_Safety × 1.3 + LLM × 1.0 + Linguistic_Accuracy × 1.5) / 14.0
```

**Quality target: 9.0+ overall AND no dimension below its auto-fail threshold.**
**If the score is below 9.0, you MUST provide a Fix Plan (see output format) with specific actions to reach 9/10.** The fix plan drives the iteration loop — Claude will send fixes to Gemini until the module reaches 9.0+.
