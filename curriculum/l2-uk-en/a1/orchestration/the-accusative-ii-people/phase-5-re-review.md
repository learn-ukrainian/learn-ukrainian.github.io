## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Pedagogy (Scope Creep - Adjectives)
- **Location**: Activity "More Complex Sentence Order" (Items 9, 10)
- **Original**: "Я бачу нашого **привітного** сусіда", "Вона знає цю **нову** вчительку"
- **Problem**: This module teaches Noun and Pronoun accusative forms. It does NOT teach Adjective accusative forms (which require -ого/-у endings). Testing students on "привітного" (friendly) and "нову" (new) is unfair scope creep.
- **Fix**: Remove the adjectives. Change to: "Я бачу нашого сусіда", "Вона знає цю вчительку".

### Issue 2: Pedagogy (Undefined Concept - "Свій")
- **Location**: Section "Practice", Pattern 4
- **Original**: "Ти любиш **свого** друга.", "Ти любиш **свою** подругу."
- **Problem**: The presentation table explicitly teaches "твій" → "твого". It does not mention the reflexive possessive "свій". While "свій" is natural, using it without explanation confuses beginners who just learned "твого".
- **Fix**: Change to "твого" and "твою" to match the taught table, OR add a small note explaining that "свій" means "one's own". Recommendation: Swap to "твого" for A1 simplicity.

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| Practice | "Ти любиш **свого** друга" | "Ти любиш **твого** друга" | Scope Consistency |

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test: 5/5
- Overwhelmed? [Pass] - The "Is it alive?" rule is a great simplification.
- Instructions clear? [Pass]
- Quick wins? [Pass] - "Feminine animate = inanimate" is a great relief/win.
- Ukrainian scary? [Pass]
- Come back tomorrow? [Pass]

Emotional beats: 5 found
- Welcome: "Warm-up" connects back to Module 11.
- Curiosity: "Did You Know?" about Slavic languages.
- Quick wins: "Feminine Animate Nouns... work exactly like inanimate!"
- Encouragement: "Here's the pattern that will save you hours..."
- Progress: "You can now..." section.

## Strengths
- **Explanation Clarity**: The "Accusative = Genitive" formula is presented as a helpful hack rather than a scary grammar rule.
- **Cultural Nuance**: The explanation of gendered professions (лікарка/вчителька) is modern, relevant, and culturally accurate.
- **Pop Culture**: The Witcher reference is excellent for engaging learners and explaining "когось" vs "щось".

## Fix Plan to Reach 9.5/10

### Pedagogy: 8/10 → 10/10

**What to fix:**
1. **Activity "More Complex Sentence Order"**:
   - Item "I see our friendly neighbor": Remove "friendly".
   - Item "She knows this new teacher": Remove "new".
   - *Reason*: Avoids testing untaught adjective grammar.
2. **Practice Section (Pattern 4)**:
   - Change "свого" → "твого".
   - Change "свою" → "твою".
   - *Reason*: Aligns practice with the Presentation table.

### Activities: 9/10 → 10/10

**What to fix:**
1. Apply the fixes above to the Activity YAML file.

### Projected Overall After Fixes

```
(9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 10 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 10) / 14 = 9.7/10
```
