## Applied Fixes

1. [File: content] Section "Afternoon and Evening": Changed "Я вечеряю з сім'єю" to "Я вечеряю вдома" — Issue 3 (Grammar Scope Creep)
2. [File: content] Section "The Reflexive Pattern (-ся / -сь)": Rewrote the rule to clarify that "-ся" is standard and always correct, removing the strict "vowels = -сь" rule that contradicted examples — Issue 1 (Pedagogy / Grammar Rule Contradiction)
3. [File: activities] Activity "Reflexive Understanding", removed Q4 ("When exactly do we use -сь...?") — Issue 2 (Activity Logic Contradiction)
