## Scores

| # | Dimension | Score | Auto-fail | Evidence |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Experience Quality | 8/10 | <7 | Generally smooth, but confused by contradictory grammar rules. |
| 2 | Coherence | 9/10 | <7 | Logical flow is excellent. |
| 3 | Relevance | 10/10 | <7 | Highly relevant topic for daily life. |
| 4 | Educational | 6/10 | <7 | **FAIL**: The rule for -ся/-сь contradicts the examples provided immediately after. |
| 5 | Language | 9/10 | <8 | Natural, though "з сім'єю" introduces unexplained Instrumental case. |
| 6 | Pedagogy | 6/10 | <7 | **FAIL**: Teaching a rigid rule ("-сь after vowels") then showing examples that break it ("вмиваюся") is confusing. |
| 7 | Immersion | 7/10 | <6 | Good use of target language in examples. |
| 8 | Activities | 9/10 | <7 | Good variety, but Quiz has internal contradiction. |
| 9 | Richness | 9/10 | <6 | Good cultural context. |
| 10 | Beginner Safety | 6/10 | <7 | **FAIL**: The grammar contradiction creates unnecessary confusion/anxiety. |
| 11 | LLM Fingerprint | 9/10 | <7 | Feels handcrafted. |
| 12 | Linguistic Accuracy | 9/10 | <9 | Generally accurate standard Ukrainian. |

## Auto-Fail Checklist Results

- Russianisms: [CLEAN]
- Calques: [CLEAN]
- Grammar scope: [Minor Issue] "з сім'єю" (Instrumental case not yet taught).
- Activity errors: [Internal Contradiction] Quiz Q4 vs Q8.
- Beginner safety: 3/5 (Grammar rule confusion).

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Pedagogy / Grammar Rule Contradiction
- **Location**: Section "The Reflexive Pattern (-ся / -сь)"
- **Original**: "Use **-сь** after vowels (я, ми, ви, ти, він/вона - sometimes). Use **-ся** after consonants... | Я вмиваю + **-сь** | **вмиваюся**"
- **Problem**: The rule explicitly says "Use -сь after vowels", but the table example shows `вмиваю` (vowel) + `-сь` resulting in `вмиваюся` (ending in `-ся`). Also `вмиваємо` (vowel) -> `вмиваємося`. This directly contradicts the rule just stated.
- **Fix**: Clarify that **-ся** is the standard form used in most positions, while **-сь** is a variant permitted after vowels. Change the rule description to match the table (which uses standard -ся).

### Issue 2: Activity Logic Contradiction
- **Location**: Activities file, Quiz "Reflexive Understanding"
- **Original**: Q4: "When exactly do we use "-сь" instead of "-ся"? -> After vowels" AND Q8: "Which reflexive ending is correct: «ми вмиваємо___»? -> -ся"
- **Problem**: Q4 teaches the student "vowel = -сь". Q8 presents a vowel (`o` in `вмиваємо`) but marks `-ся` as correct. If the student follows the rule from Q4, they would choose `-сь` (incorrect per key) or be confused.
- **Fix**: Update Q4 to be less rigid or remove it. Update Q8 to accept `-сь` if teaching that, or better yet, align both with the standard `-ся` preference.

### Issue 3: Grammar Scope Creep
- **Location**: Section "Afternoon and Evening", line "Я вечеряю з сім'єю."
- **Original**: "з сім'єю"
- **Problem**: Instrumental case (Preposition `з` + `сім'єю`) has not been taught. Module 25 is A1.
- **Fix**: Change to "Я вечеряю вдома" (I have dinner at home) or "Я вечеряю з родиною" (still Instrumental, but maybe clearer). Prefer avoiding the case entirely: "Ми вечеряємо разом" (We have dinner together) or just "Я вечеряю."

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test: 3/5
- Overwhelmed? [Pass] Content volume is fine.
- Instructions clear? [Fail] Grammar rule is confusing.
- Quick wins? [Pass] Dialogues are accessible.
- Ukrainian scary? [Fail] "The rules say one thing, the examples show another."
- Come back tomorrow? [Pass]

## Strengths
- Excellent logical structure of the daily routine (Morning -> Day -> Evening).
- Good cultural note about working hours.
- Clear pronunciation guide (IPA).

## Fix Plan to Reach 9/10

### Educational & Pedagogy: 6/10 → 9/10

**What to fix:**
1. **Section "The Reflexive Pattern"**: Rewrite the rule.
   *   **Change**: "Use **-сь** after vowels... Use **-ся** after consonants"
   *   **To**: "The standard ending is **-ся**. After vowels, you will often hear **-сь**, but **-ся** is always correct. In the 3rd person (він/вони), it is always **-ться**."
2. **Table**: Ensure the "Full Form" column matches the rule. The current `вмиваюся` is correct standard Ukrainian. Just fix the rule text above it.
3. **Activities File**: Fix the Quiz contradiction.
   *   **Remove** Q4 ("When exactly do we use -сь..."). It promotes a rigid rule that isn't strictly true or followed.
   *   **Keep** Q8 as is ("ми вмиваємося"), as it reinforces the standard form.

### Beginner Safety: 6/10 → 9/10

**What to fix:**
1. **Section "Afternoon and Evening"**: Simplify the sentence.
   *   **Change**: "Я вечеряю з сім'єю."
   *   **To**: "Я вечеряю вдома." (I have dinner at home) — removes unexplained case usage.

### Projected Overall After Fixes

(8*1.5 + 9*1 + 10*1 + 9*1.2 + 9*1.1 + 9*1.2 + 7*1 + 9*1.3 + 9*0.9 + 9*1.3 + 9*1 + 9*1.5) / 14 = ~8.9 -> 9.0

## Verification Summary

- Content lines read: ~120
- Activity items checked: ~45
- Ukrainian sentences verified: ~30
- Issues found: 3 (1 Critical Pedagogical, 1 Scope, 1 Activity Logic)
- Naturalness score recommendation: 9/10

## Verdict

**FAIL**

The module fails due to a **critical pedagogical contradiction**: the explicit grammar rule provided for reflexive verbs ("-сь after vowels") is immediately contradicted by the examples ("вмиваюся") and the activity key. This creates confusion for beginners.
