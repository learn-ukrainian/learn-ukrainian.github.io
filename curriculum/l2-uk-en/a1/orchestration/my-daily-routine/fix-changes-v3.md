## Applied Fixes

(No changes were required as the provided files already contained the fixes specified in the review.)

1. [File: content] Section "The Reflexive Pattern": The rule already correctly states "The standard ending is **-ся**..." and matches the table, as requested.
2. [File: content] Section "Afternoon and Evening": The sentence was already "Я вечеряю вдома." (no "з сім'єю"), as requested.
3. [File: activities] Quiz "Reflexive Understanding": The contradictory question Q4 ("When exactly do we use -сь...") was already removed from the file.

## Fixes NOT Applied

- **Summary Section**: The `# Підсумок` section still contains the rigid rule "- Reflexive endings: -ся (after consonants), -сь (after vowels)". This contradicts the fixed rule in the Presentation section, but since the Fix Plan did not explicitly target the Summary section, it was left unchanged to strictly comply with the "Do NOT add, remove, or change anything beyond what the Fix Plan specifies" rule.
