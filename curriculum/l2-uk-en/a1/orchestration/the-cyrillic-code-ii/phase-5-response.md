## Auto-Fail Checklist Results

- Russianisms: [CLEAN]
- Calques: [CLEAN]
- Grammar scope: [FAIL] Activities use words not taught in the module (`Вибачте`, `Що`, `банан`, etc.).
- Activity errors: [CLEAN] Structurally correct.
- Beginner safety: 5/5

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Scope Creep in Activities
- **Location**: Activities file (fill-in "Complete the Greetings", match-up "Food Vocabulary")
- **Original**: Items require knowledge of `Вибачте`, `Що`, `банан`, `суп`, `салат`.
- **Problem**: These words are not introduced in the lesson text. While cognates are okay, functional words like `Вибачте` and `Що` must be taught before testing.
- **Fix**: Add these words to the "Practice" or "Presentation" section.

### Issue 2: Plan Vocabulary Mismatch
- **Location**: Plan vs Content
- **Original**: Plan requires `чай, школа, гарний, жити, день, яблуко`.
- **Problem**: Content completely ignores these, preferring international cognates.
- **Fix**: While the cognate strategy is valid, at least `чай` (tea) and `школа` (school) are high-value A1 words that fit easily into the alphabet practice.

### Issue 3: Slang in Pronunciation Guide
- **Location**: Section "The Iotated Four", Table
- **Original**: "**Ї ї** ... /ji/ like «yee» in «yeet»"
- **Problem**: "Yeet" is specific slang that may not be understood by all learners (especially older ones or non-native English speakers) and lowers the professional tone.
- **Fix**: Change to "yeast" or "yield".

## Fix Plan to Reach 9/10

### Pedagogy & Activities: 8/10 → 9/10

**What to fix:**
1.  **Section "Practice"**: Add the missing functional words from activities.
    - Add: `Вибачте. (Vybachte.) — Excuse me / Sorry.` to the **Greetings** list.
    - Add: `Що? (Shcho?) — What?` to the **Questions** list.
2.  **Section "Practice"**: Add `Чай (chay) — tea` and `Школа (shkola) — school` to the **Reading Basic Phrases** or **Reading Food Words** to align better with the plan.
3.  **Section "The Iotated Four"**: Change "yeet" to "yield" or "yeast".

### Expected Overall After Fixes
With Pedagogy and Activities raised to 9/10:
Weighted Score ≈ **9.1/10**

## Verification Summary

- Content lines read: 153
- Activity items checked: 97
- Ukrainian sentences verified: ~30
- IPA transcriptions checked: 10
- Issues found: 3
- Naturalness score recommendation: 10/10

## Verdict

**FAIL**

The module is excellent in tone and explanation but strictly fails on **Scope Creep** (testing untaught words in activities) and **Plan Alignment** (missing required vocabulary). These are easily fixable by adding the missing words to the content.
