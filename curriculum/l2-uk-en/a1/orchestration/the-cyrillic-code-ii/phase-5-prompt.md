1. **Content** (the lesson you're reviewing): `# The Cyrillic Code II

## Warm-up

Welcome back, code-breaker! In Module 1, you cracked 19 letters. That's already more than half the Ukrainian Cyrillic alphabet. Today, you'll conquer the final 14 letters. Some of these are completely unique to Ukrainian. They're the reason Ukrainian sounds different from Russian, Polish, or any other Slavic language.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to read **любов** (love), **дякую** (thank you), **Київ** (Kyiv), and **борщ** (borscht). You'll understand why Ukrainian is one of the most melodic Slavic languages. And you'll know how to avoid the dreaded italic trap that trips up every beginner.

## Presentation

### The Unique Seven (Г, Ґ, Ж, Ш, Щ, Ч, Ц)

These letters exist in other Slavic languages, but Ukrainian uses them in its own special way. They give Ukrainian its distinctive sound:

| Letter  | Sound                      | Example                | English   |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------- |
| **Г г** | /ɦ/ like «h» in «ahead»    | **г**оловá (holová)    | head      |
| **Ґ ґ** | /g/ like «g» in «go»       | **ґ**ума (guma)        | eraser    |
| **Ж ж** | /ʒ/ like «s» in «pleasure» | **ж**еле (zhele)       | jelly     |
| **Ш ш** | /ʃ/ like «sh» in «shop»    | **ш**окола́д (shokolád) | chocolate |
| **Щ щ** | /ʃt͡ʃ/ like «shch» blend    | бо́**рщ** (borshch)     | borscht   |
| **Ч ч** | /t͡ʃ/ like «ch» in «church» | **ч**емпіо́н (chempión) | champion  |
| **Ц ц** | /t͡s/ like «ts» in «cats»   | **ц**ентр (tsentr)     | center    |

The letters **Г** and **Ґ** are perhaps the most important distinction. **Г** (hook) makes a soft breathy «h» sound. **Ґ** (hook with hat) makes a hard «g» sound like in English «go.» Russian lost the **Ґ** sound centuries ago, but Ukrainian kept it!

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> The letter **Щ** (shcha) is one of the most recognizable sounds in Ukrainian. When foreigners hear **борщ** (borscht), they immediately recognize it as Ukrainian. The UNESCO included Ukrainian borscht culture on the endangered heritage list in 2022 to protect it during the war.

**Ж** (zheh) is the voiced partner of **Ш** (shah). Think of them like «s» and «z» in English. **Шоколад** (chocolate) has the voiceless **Ш**. **Желе** (jelly) has the voiced **Ж**.

**Ц** (tseh) makes the sharp «ts» sound. It's in words like **центр** (center) and **цукор** (sugar). This sound doesn't exist in standard English, but you hear it at the end of «cats.»

### The Iotated Four (Є, Ї, Ю, Я)

These are vowels that carry a built-in «y» sound (called «iotation»). They're uniquely Ukrainian and give the language its melodic quality:

| Letter  | Sound                     | Example                | English   |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------- |
| **Є є** | /jɛ/ like «ye» in «yes»   | **Є**вро́па (Yevropa)   | Europe    |
| **Ї ї** | /ji/ like «yee» in «yield» | Ки́**ї**в (Kýyiv)       | Kyiv      |
| **Ю ю** | /ju/ like «you»           | д**я́**к**у**ю (dyákuyu) | thank you |
| **Я я** | /jɑ/ like «ya» in «yacht» | **я**к (yak)           | how       |

These letters are why «Kyiv» is spelled with a «y» in English. The Ukrainian name is **Київ**. That **Ї** makes a «yi» sound. So it's «Kýyiv,» not «Keev.»

**Європа** (Europe) starts with **Є**, giving it that «Yevropa» sound. **Дякую** (thank you) has both **Я** and **Ю**, making it flow: «dyákuyu.»

> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** «Київ» is just the Ukrainian spelling.
> **Fact:** «Київ» (Kýyiv) is the correct Ukrainian name. «Kiev» is Russian. Since 1991, Ukraine is independent. The world now uses «Kyiv» to respect Ukrainian identity. The AP Style Guide switched in 2019!

### The Soft Sign (Ь)

The soft sign **Ь** (myakyi znak) is perhaps the strangest letter for English speakers. It has no sound of its own. Instead, it softens the consonant before it:

| Without Ь         | With Ь             | Difference           |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| рис (rys) «rice»  | рись (rysʲ) «lynx» | «s» vs «sʲ» (soft s) |
| лан (lan) «field» | лань (lanʲ) «doe»  | «n» vs «nʲ» (soft n) |

The soft sign appears in the word **будь ла́ска** (please): «budʲ láska.» That **Ь** softens the **Д** sound.

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: The Witcher**
>
> In the Ukrainian dub of Netflix's «The Witcher» (Відьма́к - Vidʲmák), the title uses the soft sign! **Відьмак** means «witcher» or «sorcerer,» and that **Ь** softens the **Д**. Ukrainian has a rich tradition of Slavic fantasy, and The Witcher books are hugely popular in Ukraine.

### The Hard I (И)

The letter **И** is different from **І**. While **І** makes the soft «ee» sound (like in «meet»), **И** makes a harder sound, like «i» in «bit» or «sit»:

| Letter  | Sound           | Example              | English |
| ------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| **І і** | /i/ like «meet» | п**і**ца (pítsa)     | pizza   |
| **И и** | /ɪ/ like «bit»  | джи́нс**и** (dzhýnsy) | jeans   |

The word **джинси** (jeans) has the hard **И** at the end: «dzhýnsy.» The city **Київ** has the soft **І**: «Kýyiv.»

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> When you order food in **Київ** (Kyiv), you'll use words like **борщ** (borscht), **цукор** (sugar), and **дякую** (thank you). Pronouncing **Київ** correctly (Kýyiv, not Keev) shows respect for Ukrainian language and identity. Locals will appreciate it!

### The Short Y (Й)

The letter **Й** (yi kratke, «short i») makes a quick «y» sound like in English «boy» or «yes.» It never starts words on its own in native Ukrainian words, but appears in borrowed words like **йогурт** (yogurt):

| Letter  | Sound                 | Example             | English |
| ------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| **Й й** | /j/ like «y» in «boy» | **й**огурт (yohurt) | yogurt  |

You'll also see **Й** at the end of words and syllables, creating sounds like «ay,» «oy,» or «iy.» In **Київ**, the final sound is actually **ЇВ** (yiv), but in words like **край** (edge, country), you hear the **Й** clearly: «kray.»

### The Italic Warning

When Ukrainians write in cursive or italic, some letters look COMPLETELY different from their printed forms. This is the number one reason learners get confused when they see handwritten Ukrainian:

| Printed | Italic | Looks Like  | Sound          |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| **т**   | *т*    | Latin «m»   | «t» (not m!)   |
| **п**   | *п*    | Latin «n»   | «p» (not n!)   |
| **д**   | *д*    | Latin «g»   | «d» (not g!)   |
| **и**   | *и*    | Latin «u»   | «y/i» (not u!) |
| **л**   | *л*    | hook shape  | «l»            |
| **г**   | *г*    | round shape | «h»            |

So the word **мама** (mama) in italic looks like *мама*, which might look like «mama» but with weird shapes. Don't panic. It's still «mama.»

The word **привіт** (hello) in italic is *привіт*. That italic **т** at the end looks like an «m,» but it's still a «t» sound.

> 💡 **Don't Panic!**
>
> If you find italics confusing, you're not alone. Most beginners struggle with the italic **т** and **д**. Just remember: if it's a lowercase letter that looks like a Latin «m,» it's almost certainly a Ukrainian **т**. If it looks like a Latin «g,» it's a **д**. With practice, your brain will stop seeing the Latin letters and start seeing the Ukrainian ones!

## Practice

### Self-Check: Can You Read This?

Before moving on, try to read these words aloud. They contain the letters we learned today:

1. **Гараж** (ha-razh) — Garage
2. **Центр** (tsentr) — Center
3. **Любов** (lyu-bov) — Love
4. **Україна** (Uk-ra-yi-na) — Ukraine
5. **Смачного!** (Smach-no-ho!) — Enjoy your meal! (Bon appétit!)

### Reading Basic Phrases

Now that you know all 33 letters, let's read some real Ukrainian phrases:

**Greetings:**
Привіт! (Pryvit!) — Hello!
Дякую. (Dyakuyu.) — Thank you.
Будь ласка. (Budʲ laska.) — Please. / You're welcome.
До побачення. (Do pobachennya.) — Goodbye.
Вибачте. (Vybachte.) — Excuse me. / Sorry.

**Questions:**
Як? (Yak?) — How?
Де? (De?) — Where?
Хто? (Khto?) — Who?
Що? (Shcho?) — What?

**Answers:**
Так. (Tak.) — Yes.
Ні. (Ni.) — No.
Добре. (Dobre.) — Good. / Well.

### Mini-Dialogue 1: First Meeting

— Привіт! Як справи? *(Pryvit! Yak spravy?)* — Hello! How are things?
— Добре, дякую! *(Dobre, dyakuyu!)* — Good, thank you!
— Ласкаво просимо! *(Laskavo prosymo!)* — Welcome!

Notice **дякую** uses the iotated **Я** (ya) and **Ю** (yu). It flows: «dya-ku-yu.» This is one of the most useful words in Ukrainian!

### Mini-Dialogue 2: At a Café in Lviv

— Борщ? *(Borshch?)* — Borscht?
— Так, борщ, будь ласка. *(Tak, borshch, budʲ laska.)* — Yes, borscht, please.
— Цукор? *(Tsukor?)* — Sugar?
— Ні, дякую. *(Ni, dyakuyu.)* — No, thank you.

The word **борщ** showcases the **Щ** sound perfectly. It's not «borsh,» it's «borshch» — that soft «shch» blend is uniquely Ukrainian.

### Reading Everyday Words

Чай (chay) — tea
Школа (shkola) — school
Яблуко (yabluko) — apple
Гарний (harnyi) — beautiful
Жити (zhyty) — to live
День (denʲ) — day

### Reading Food Words

Борщ (borshch) — borscht
Суп (sup) — soup
Салат (salat) — salad
Банан (banan) — banana
Чай (chay) — tea
Йогурт (yogurt) — yogurt
Желе (zhele) — jelly
Майонез (mayonez) — mayonnaise
Шоколад (shokolad) — chocolate
Цукор (tsukor) — sugar

## Production

You've now learned all 33 letters of the Ukrainian Cyrillic alphabet. That's 19 from Module 1, plus 14 from this module. You can read any Ukrainian word now, even if you don't understand it yet.

Try reading these cities and see if you can decode them:

Київ /ˈkɪjiʋ/ (Kyiv)
Львів /lʲˈʋiʋ/ (Lviv)
Одеса /ɔˈdɛsɑ/ (Odesa)
Харків /ˈxɑrkiʋ/ (Kharkiv)
Дніпро /dniˈprɔ/ (Dnipro)

And these Ukrainian words:

Україна /ʊkrɑˈjinɑ/ (Ukraine)
мова /ˈmɔvɑ/ (language)
алфавіт /ɑlfɑˈvit/ (alphabet)
слово /ˈslɔvɔ/ (word)
буква /ˈbukvɑ/ (letter)

## Cultural Insight

### Why the Alphabet Matters

Learning to read Cyrillic isn't just about decoding letters. It's about accessing a culture that has been deliberately hidden or misrepresented for centuries. When you write «Kyiv» instead of «Kiev,» you're choosing the Ukrainian name over the Russian one. When you learn that **Г** makes an «h» sound (not a «g»), you're hearing how Ukrainian actually sounds, not how Russians pronounce Ukrainian words.

The Ukrainian alphabet is a tool of resistance. During Soviet times, Ukrainian language and culture were suppressed. Speaking Ukrainian in school was punished. Ukrainian books were banned. Yet people kept the language alive in villages, in songs, in secret poetry.

Today, when you learn Ukrainian, you're joining a tradition of preservation. Every word you read, every letter you decode, is a small act of keeping Ukrainian culture alive.

> 📜 **History Bite**
>
> In 1863, the Russian Empire issued the Valuev Circular, which banned Ukrainian-language publications. In 1876, the Ems Ukaz made it even stricter, banning Ukrainian in theaters, schools, and print. Ukrainian was called «Little Russian» and dismissed as a peasant dialect. Despite this, Ukrainian writers like Taras Shevchenko kept the language alive through poetry. Speaking Ukrainian was a revolutionary act.

### The Complete Alphabet

Here are all 33 letters. First part: А Б В Г Ґ Д Е.

Second part: Є Ж З И І Ї Й К.

Third part: Л М Н О П Р С Т У.

Fourth part: Ф Х Ц Ч Ш Щ Ь Ю Я.

All letters with lowercase: Аа, Бб, Вв, Гг, Ґґ, Дд, Ее.

Next group: Єє, Жж, Зз, Ии, Іі, Її, Йй, Кк.

Continuing: Лл, Мм, Нн, Оо, Пп, Рр, Сс, Тт, Уу.

Final group: Фф, Хх, Цц, Чч, Шш, Щщ, Ьь, Юю, Яя.

You know every single one now. Congratulations!

# Підсумок

In this module, you learned the final 14 letters of Ukrainian Cyrillic:

You learned:

**Unique Seven:** Г (h), Ґ (g), Ж (zh), Ш (sh), Щ (shch), Ч (ch), Ц (ts).
**Iotated Four:** Є (ye), Ї (yi), Ю (yu), Я (ya).
**Soft Sign:** Ь (softens consonants).
**Hard I:** И (hard i sound).
**Й:** The short «y» sound.

You can now read any Ukrainian word in Cyrillic. You learned essential phrases like **привіт** (hello), **дякую** (thank you), **будь ласка** (please), and **до побачення** (goodbye). You understand why **Київ** is pronounced «Kýyiv» and why **борщ** has that distinctive «shch» sound.

Most importantly, you learned that the Ukrainian alphabet is more than letters. It's a symbol of cultural identity that survived centuries of suppression. When you read Ukrainian, you're participating in an act of cultural preservation.

Next module, we'll start learning about noun gender and why it matters!

6. **Research notes** (if exists): `# Research: The Cyrillic Code II

**Level:** A1 | **Module:** 02
**Researched:** 2026-02-07

## State Standard Reference
- Section: §4.1.1, §4.1.2, §4.1.3, §4.1.4
- §4.1.1: Український алфавіт — full 33-letter alphabet with upper/lowercase
- §4.1.2: Апостроф — дев'ять, м'яч, п'ять (not yet taught but relevant context)
- §4.1.3: М'який знак — Львів, шість (soft sign function)
- §4.1.4: Голосні та приголосні звуки — тверді та м'які приголосні (hard vs soft consonants), дзвінкі та глухі (voiced vs voiceless), звуки [дж], [дз]
- Level placement: Confirmed A1 — completing the alphabet is a first-contact requirement

## Vocabulary Check
- Core words: центр, чай, школа, гарний, жити, день, Європа, яблуко — all high-frequency
- борщ, дякую, привіт, будь ласка — essential survival phrases
- Frequency source: All confirmed high-frequency via everyday usage; international cognates widely recognized
- Ґ words are rare in Ukrainian (ґанок, ґума, ґудзик) — this is expected and pedagogically noted

## Cultural Hook (2 facts)
- **Fact 1:** UNESCO inscribed Ukrainian borscht culture on its List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding in July 2022, during the ongoing Russian invasion.
  - Source: https://ich.unesco.org/en/USL/culture-of-ukrainian-borscht-cooking-01852
  - How to use: Already integrated in "Did You Know?" callout about Щ and борщ

- **Fact 2:** The Valuev Circular (1863) and Ems Ukaz (1876) banned Ukrainian-language publications and education. Taras Shevchenko's poetry kept the language alive.
  - Source: https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Валуєвський_циркуляр
  - How to use: Already integrated in "History Bite" callout in Cultural Insight section

## Cross-references
- Builds on: a1-01 (The Cyrillic Code I) — 19 letters learned
- Connects to: a1-03 (The Gender Code) — now that alphabet is complete, move to grammar

**Do not proceed until you have read every line of the content and every activity item.**

> **ANTI-STALE-REVIEW RULE**: This file may have been fixed since a previous review. You MUST review the CURRENT state of the files, not repeat findings from a prior review. If an issue was cited before but is now fixed, it must NOT appear in your review. Every finding must be verifiable by quoting the actual current content.

## Audit Metrics (Facts from Claude)

```
Word count:       2139 / 1531 (140%)
Activities:       9
Vocabulary items: 0
Engagement boxes: 0
Immersion:        varies% (target: varies)
Audit status:     pending review
```

---

## STEP 1: PLAN VERIFICATION

Cross-check content against the plan file:

1. **Outline compliance**: Is every section from `content_outline` present as an H2/H3?
2. **Vocabulary scope**: List every Ukrainian vocabulary word taught in the content. Compare against `vocabulary_hints.required` in the plan. Flag any word NOT in the plan.
3. **Grammar scope**: What grammar does this module teach? What grammar from LATER modules appears in examples or dialogues? (This is scope creep — flag it.)
4. **Objectives**: Are all learning objectives from the plan addressed in the content?

Report findings as:
```
Plan-Content Alignment: [PASS/FAIL]
- Sections: [all present / missing: X, Y]
- Vocabulary: [X/Y from plan used, Z extra words found]
- Grammar scope: [clean / scope creep: specific items]
- Objectives: [all covered / missing: X]
```

---

## STEP 2: DEEP VERIFICATION (Line by Line)

### Ukrainian Sentences
Go through the file section by section. For EACH Ukrainian sentence:
- Is grammar correct? (cases, verb forms, agreement)
- Does it sound natural? (not robotic, not calqued from English)
- Are there Russianisms? (check against list below)
- Is vocabulary appropriate for the level?

### English Sentences
- Is it clear and accessible?
- Warm tutor voice or cold textbook?
- Over-explaining simple things? Under-explaining complex ones?

### IPA Transcriptions (if present)
- Every transcription must be checked for correct stress placement
- Ukrainian stress is unpredictable — verify each one
- Watch for English approximations instead of Ukrainian phonemes

### Activities (EVERY ITEM)

**CRITICAL: Read the actual YAML file line by line.** Do NOT assume what the file contains — read it. If a previous review said "add English cues" but the file already has them, acknowledge the fix is present. Never cite an issue that doesn't exist in the CURRENT file.

Check each activity item individually:
- **quiz**: Grammatically correct? Exactly one correct answer? Options plausible?
- **fill-in**: Sentence correct with answer filled in? Only ONE valid answer given the context/cues? Distractors plausible?
- **match-up**: All pairs correct? No duplicates?
- **true-false**: True statements actually true? False clearly false?
- **unjumble**: Answer forms a correct, natural sentence?
- **group-sort**: Items correctly categorized?
- **anagram**: Solution correct? Hint clear?

Count as you go. You MUST report how many items you checked.

**Verification rule**: For EVERY issue you cite, quote the EXACT line from the file. If you cannot quote it, the issue does not exist.

---

## STEP 3: AUTO-FAIL CHECKLIST

Check EVERY category. Report "[CLEAN]" or list specific findings.

### Russianisms
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| кушать | їсти |
| приймати участь | брати участь |
| самий кращий | найкращий |
| слідуючий | наступний |
| на протязі | протягом |
| любий (any) | будь-який |
| отвічати | відповідати |
| вообще | взагалі |
| получати | отримувати |
| відноситися | ставитися |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Calques
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| робити сенс | мати сенс |
| брати місце | відбуватися |
| це є | це (usually) |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Grammar Scope Violations
At module 2, students know ONLY modules 1-1. Any grammar from later modules is scope creep.
- Past tense (if not yet taught)
- Cases not yet introduced
- Verb forms not yet taught

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list specific violations with line numbers]

### Activity Errors
- Wrong answer marked as correct
- Multiple valid answers but only one accepted
- Grammatically incorrect sentences
- Duplicate items

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with activity number and item number]

### Beginner Safety ("Would I Continue?" Test)
| Question | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Did I feel overwhelmed? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Were instructions clear? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Did I get quick wins? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Was Ukrainian scary? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Would I come back tomorrow? | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Total** | **X/5** |

Emotional beats found:
- Welcome/orientation: [yes/no, where]
- Curiosity trigger: [yes/no, where]
- Quick wins: [count, where]
- Encouragement: [count, where]
- Progress marker: [yes/no, where]

---

## STEP 4: SCORE DIMENSIONS

**Score ONLY after completing Steps 1-3.** Each score must link to specific findings.

### Scoring Rules
- **9-10**: Excellent — no issues found in this dimension
- **7-8**: Good — minor issues found
- **5-6**: Needs work — multiple issues
- **<5**: Serious problems — major rewrite needed
- **If you found 3 grammar errors, Language cannot be 9**
- **If scope creep found, Relevance and Pedagogy cannot be 8+**

### Auto-Fail Thresholds
| Dimension | Auto-fail if below |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Experience Quality | <7 |
| Coherence | <7 |
| Relevance | <7 |
| Educational | <7 |
| Language | <8 |
| Pedagogy | <7 |
| Immersion | <6 |
| Activities | <7 |
| Richness | <6 |
| Beginner Safety | <7 |
| LLM Fingerprint | <7 |
| Linguistic Accuracy | <9 |

### Weighted Overall Score
```
Overall = (Experience × 1.5 + Coherence × 1.0 + Relevance × 1.0 + Educational × 1.2 +
          Language × 1.1 + Pedagogy × 1.2 + Immersion × 1.0 + Activities × 1.3 +
          Richness × 0.9 + Beginner_Safety × 1.3 + LLM × 1.0 + Linguistic_Accuracy × 1.5) / 14.0
```

**Quality target: 9.0+ overall AND no dimension below its auto-fail threshold.**
**If the score is below 9.0, you MUST provide a Fix Plan (see output format) with specific actions to reach 9/10.** The fix plan drives the iteration loop — Claude will send fixes to Gemini until the module reaches 9.0+.
