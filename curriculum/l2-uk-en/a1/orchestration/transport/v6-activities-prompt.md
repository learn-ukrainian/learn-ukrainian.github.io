# V6 Activity Generation — Structured YAML for Inline + Workbook Exercises

You are generating structured exercise YAML for a Ukrainian language module. The exercises will be injected into the lesson tab (inline) and workbook tab (workbook) of the module.

## Your Task

Generate an `activities/transport.yaml` file for module **32: Transport** (a1).

**CRITICAL: Output ONLY raw YAML.** Your very first character must be `version:`. No markdown, no commentary, no explanation, no file paths, no "Here is the YAML", no code fences. Just the YAML document starting with `version: "1.0"`. ANY text before `version:` will cause a parse failure.

## ⚠️ HARD COUNT TARGETS — READ TWICE

These are the binding numerical contracts for THIS module. The audit will FAIL if you fall short.

| Bucket | Min | Max | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total activities | 10 | 10+ | inline + workbook combined |
| Inline (lesson tab) | 4 | 6 | one per `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY -->` marker, see below |
| Workbook (Зошит tab) | 6 | 9 | extended practice |
| Items per activity | 6 | — | each activity must have at least 6 items (unless its type cap is lower — see Activity Type Reference below) |

**You MUST ship at least 4 inline activities AND at least 6 workbook activities.** Going under either is a hard failure — the audit gate enforces it and the build will reject your output.

**Type diversity is required.** The module (inline + workbook combined) MUST use at least **0** distinct activity types — do NOT ship a wall of the same type. As a quality target, quiz + true-false combined should be NO MORE than ~25% of the workbook (i.e. lean on the priority types below, not on easy multiple-choice). Use the `WORKBOOK_PRIORITY_TYPES` list below; those carry the most weight at this level. (If `0` is `0`, the audit profile for this level does not enforce type diversity — but variety still produces a better lesson, so aim for 4+ types when the workbook allows it.)

---

## Allowed types for THIS level

- **Inline (lesson) types:** image-to-letter, letter-grid, match-up, watch-and-repeat, quiz, true-false, fill-in, classify
- **Inline priority (preferred):** image-to-letter, match-up, fill-in, quiz, watch-and-repeat
- **Workbook types:** fill-in, match-up, group-sort, anagram, unjumble, quiz, true-false, classify, divide-words, count-syllables, pick-syllables, observe, phrase-table, odd-one-out
- **Workbook priority (preferred):** fill-in, match-up, group-sort, anagram, unjumble
- **FORBIDDEN at this level:** cloze, error-correction, mark-the-words, translate, essay-response, critical-analysis, reading, comparative-study, authorial-intent, etymology-trace, translation-critique, source-evaluation, debate, paleography-analysis, dialect-comparison, transcription, highlight-morphemes, grammar-identify, select

Pick from the allowed list. Lean heavily on the priority lists. Do not use any forbidden type — the build will reject it.

---

## Inline vs Workbook Split

Activities have two placement categories:

1. **inline** — short, focused exercises placed directly in the lesson (Урок tab) at specific injection points. The writer has placed `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: {id} -->` markers in the prose. Each inline activity MUST have an `id` that matches one of these markers.

2. **workbook** — extended practice exercises in the workbook (Зошит tab). These do NOT need ids.

**Rule of thumb:** inline = 4–6 quick checks after key teaching points. Workbook = 6–9 deeper practice exercises covering the full topic. **Every inline marker in the prose MUST have a matching inline activity** — that is what determines `INLINE_MIN`, so do NOT skip markers.

---

## Injection Markers in the Prose

The writer placed these markers in the module content. Your inline activities must match them:

- `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: quiz-which-transport -->`
- `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: quiz-instrumental-or-locative -->`
- `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: fill-in-buy-ticket -->`
- `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: fill-in-ask-directions -->`

Each inline activity's `id` must match one of these markers exactly (lowercase, hyphenated).

---

## Plan Activity Hints

The plan specifies these exercises to create:

- focus: Which transport? Match situation to transport type.
  items: 8
  type: quiz
- focus: 'Buy a ticket: Один ___ до ___, будь ласка.'
  items: 6
  type: fill-in
- focus: Автобусом or на метро? Choose the right pattern.
  items: 6
  type: quiz
- focus: 'Ask for directions: Як дістатися до ___?'
  items: 6
  type: fill-in


You MUST create activities that cover all these hints. Distribute them between inline and workbook as appropriate: focused checks go inline, extended practice goes to workbook.

---

## Plan Vocabulary

These words are the module's vocabulary foundation. ALL exercise items must use words from this list or from the prose:

recommended:
- трамвай (tram, m)
- маршрутка (minibus, f)
- літак (plane, m)
- направо (right)
- наліво (left)
- прямо (straight)
- дістатися (to get to)
required:
- автобус (bus, m)
- метро (metro, n)
- таксі (taxi, n)
- потяг (train, m)
- квиток (ticket, m)
- зупинка (stop, f)


**Grounding rule:** Every Ukrainian word in your exercises must appear either in the prose content or in this vocabulary list. Do NOT invent new words the learner hasn't seen.

---

## Module Content (the prose the learner reads before exercises)

<module_content>
## Діалоги (Dialogues)

Imagine you have just arrived at the Boryspil airport outside of Kyiv, and you need to navigate to your hotel in the city center. Or perhaps you want to visit a friend across town. In any modern city, knowing how to navigate the public transport network is a completely essential survival skill. Moving around efficiently requires much more than simply memorizing the names of vehicles; you need to know how to ask for directions, find the correct stop, and purchase the right ticket. This module covers the vocabulary and grammar patterns you need to confidently ride a bus, take the metro, or catch a train anywhere in Ukraine. 

Consider a practical scenario. A visitor has arrived in a new city and needs to find the main railway station.

> **Приїжджий:** Як дістатися до вокзалу? *(How do I get to the train station?)*
> **Друг:** Їдьте автобусом або на метро. *(Take a bus or the metro.)*
> **Приїжджий:** Який автобус? *(Which bus?)*
> **Друг:** Номер сім. Зупинка ось там. *(Number seven. The stop is over there.)*
> **Приїжджий:** Дякую! *(Thank you!)*
> **Друг:** На здоров'я! *(You are welcome!)*

This short exchange introduces several vital pieces of information. The phrase **як дістатися до** (how to get to) is your primary and most natural tool for asking directions. Notice the response: the speaker uses **їдьте** (go / ride) followed by **автобусом** (by bus) or **на метро** (by metro). Finally, locating the **зупинка** (stop) is the necessary last step before boarding the vehicle.

Once you arrive at the train or bus station, you will often need to interact with a cashier at the ticket window. Purchasing a ticket for an intercity trip involves specific conversational patterns.

> **Приїжджий:** Один квиток до Львова, будь ласка. *(One ticket to Lviv, please.)*
> **Касир:** В один бік чи туди й назад? *(One way or round trip?)*
> **Приїжджий:** Туди й назад. Скільки коштує? *(Round trip. How much does it cost?)*
> **Касир:** П'ятсот гривень. *(Five hundred hryvnias.)*
> **Приїжджий:** О котрій відправлення? *(At what time is the departure?)*
> **Касир:** О дев'ятій ранку. *(At nine in the morning.)*

In this transaction, you are combining your new knowledge of transport with previously learned numbers and time expressions. Asking **скільки коштує** (how much does it cost) is a universal skill. You also just learned the highly useful phrases **в один бік** (one way) and **туди й назад** (round trip).

## Транспорт (Transport Types)

City transport, known as **громадський транспорт** (public transport), forms the absolute backbone of urban life in Ukraine. The single most common vehicle you will see is the **автобус** (bus, masculine). Many large cities also operate a **тролейбус** (trolleybus, masculine), which runs quietly on electricity from overhead wires, and a **трамвай** (tram, masculine), which runs on metal tracks through the streets. Another ubiquitous option is the **маршрутка** (minibus, feminine), a smaller private bus that follows a specific, fixed route. You will also frequently encounter two highly useful indeclinable nouns of foreign origin: **метро** (metro / subway, neuter) and **таксі** (taxi, neuter). Because they are indeclinable, their endings never change, regardless of their grammatical role in the sentence.

When you need to travel between different cities or countries, you will switch to using **міжміський транспорт** (intercity transport). For comfortable, long-distance journeys across the vast territory of Ukraine, the most popular and reliable option is the **потяг** (train, masculine). You can also take an intercity **автобус** (bus) for shorter regional trips between neighboring towns. For international flights or rapid cross-country travel, you would instead use a **літак** (plane, masculine).

<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: quiz-which-transport -->

In the Ukrainian language, verbs of motion are highly specific and descriptive. While English uses the general verb "to go" for almost everything, Ukrainian strictly separates walking from riding. You must use the verb **іти** (to go on foot) when walking, but you must use the verb **їхати** (to go by vehicle) whenever you use any form of transport. When stating the exact method of transport, Ukrainian uses two distinct patterns. The first pattern uses the instrumental case chunk, which simply changes the ending of the noun to mean "by means of."

*   **їхати автобусом** — to go by bus
*   **їхати тролейбусом** — to go by trolleybus
*   **їхати трамваєм** — to go by tram
*   **їхати потягом** — to go by train

The second pattern uses the preposition **на** (on / at) followed by the locative case chunk. This prepositional pattern is strictly used for indeclinable nouns and for the word for car. Because indeclinable nouns cannot change their endings, they simply follow the preposition without any modification.

*   **їхати на метро** — to go by metro
*   **їхати на таксі** — to go by taxi
*   **їхати на машині** — to go by car

Note that both of these patterns translate identically to "by [transport]" in English. You simply need to memorize which vehicle uses which grammatical pattern.

<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: quiz-instrumental-or-locative -->

## Корисні фрази (Useful Phrases)

Navigating complex transport networks requires mastering a few core phrases. Before you can even ride, you must locate the correct **зупинка** (stop or station). If you are specifically looking for a bus, you would ask a passerby:

*   **Де зупинка автобуса?** — Where is the bus stop?
*   **Де станція метро?** — Where is the metro station?

Once you arrive there, you will likely need a **квиток** (ticket). To purchase one at a kiosk, simply state the quantity and your destination:

*   **Один квиток, будь ласка.** — One ticket, please.
*   **Скільки коштує квиток?** — How much does the ticket cost?

If you are waiting on the platform for a train to arrive, you might ask someone nearby:

*   **Коли наступний потяг?** — When is the next train?

<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: fill-in-buy-ticket -->

Sometimes you need clear directions to a specific landmark or a distant station. The most natural and polite way to ask someone for this information is by using the phrase **як дістатися до** (how to get to).

*   **Вибачте, як дістатися до аеропорту?** — Excuse me, how do I get to the airport?
*   **Як дістатися до центру міста?** — How do I get to the city center?
*   **Як дістатися до вокзалу?** — How do I get to the train station?

Locals will often reply by combining transport modes with the basic directional words you have already learned in previous modules. For example, they might say: **Йдіть прямо, потім наліво** (Go straight, then left) or **Поверніть направо** (Turn right). They might also tell you: **Їдьте прямо автобусом** (Ride straight by bus).

Once you are safely on board your chosen vehicle, you may still need to interact with fellow passengers to ensure you are on the right track. If you are unsure of your current location, you can politely ask:

*   **Яка це зупинка?** — What stop is this?

If you think it is your time to leave the vehicle, you can politely ask someone who is blocking the door:

*   **Мені виходити тут?** — Do I get off here?
*   **Ви виходите?** — Are you getting off?

:::tip
When talking about a train or a bus leaving its station, native Ukrainian speakers use the verb **рушати** (to depart / to start moving) for trains, and **відбувати** or **виїжджати** for buses. It is best to use these authentic verbs instead of the direct translation `<!-- VERIFY -->`, which is a very common error among language learners. For instance, you should say **Потяг рушає** (The train is departing).

<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: fill-in-ask-directions -->

## Підсумок — Summary

In this module, you have acquired the essential vocabulary needed to effectively navigate urban and intercity environments in Ukraine. We explored common city transport options such as the **автобус** (bus), **трамвай** (tram), and the very useful indeclinable nouns **метро** (metro) and **таксі** (taxi). For much longer journeys, you now know the word **потяг** (train) and **літак** (plane). Crucially, you learned to distinguish between walking (**іти**) and riding (**їхати**). When expressing exactly how you travel, you must remember the two distinct grammatical patterns. The first pattern uses the instrumental chunk directly, such as **автобусом** (by bus) or **потягом** (by train). The second pattern requires the preposition **на** for indeclinable nouns and cars, resulting in phrases like **на метро** (by metro) or **на машині** (by car). You also practiced finding the **зупинка** (stop) and asking **як дістатися до** (how to get to) a specific destination.

Review these practical examples to build your confidence and solidify your new skills. Practice saying them aloud multiple times until they feel completely natural to you.

*   How do you get to work? — **Я їду на роботу автобусом.** (I go to work by bus.)
*   Or by metro: — **Я їду на роботу на метро.** (I go to work by metro.)
*   Buy a train ticket to Lviv. — **Один квиток до Львова, будь ласка.** (One ticket to Lviv, please.)
*   Ask where the bus stop is. — **Вибачте, де зупинка автобуса?** (Excuse me, where is the bus stop?)
*   Ask how to get to the station. — **Як дістатися до вокзалу?** (How do I get to the train station?)
*   Ask the price of a ticket. — **Скільки коштує квиток?** (How much does the ticket cost?)
*   Check if you need to get off at this stop. — **Мені виходити тут?** (Do I get off here?)

You are now fully ready to confidently travel across the city or across the country!

## Learner Level Context

**Level: A1.4+ (Module 32/55) — BEGINNER**

The learner knows ~500 words, basic grammar, can form sentences.

**Instructions in simple Ukrainian with English translation in parentheses.**
Example: 'Оберіть правильний варіант (Choose the correct option)'

**All core activity types are appropriate.**


## Topic-Specific Exercise Patterns (from Ukrainian pedagogy)

These patterns come from МійКлас and Ukrainian textbook analysis. They show what KINDS of exercises work best for this module's topic. Use them as templates — adapt the specific content to this module's vocabulary and concepts.

### Pattern: grammar-pronouns [§4.2.1.4, §4.2.2]
**Особові займенники** (Personal pronouns)
- **match-up** — Займенник → дієслово: Зіставити особовий займенник із правильною формою дієслова — зв'язок займенника з дієвідмінюванням / Match personal pronoun with correct verb form — linking pronouns to conjugation
  - Instruction: *З'єднайте займенник із дієсловом*
- **fill-in** — Вставте займенник: Обрати правильний займенник за контекстом речення / Choose the correct pronoun based on sentence context
  - Instruction: *Вставте правильний займенник*
- **group-sort** — Однина чи множина?: Розподілити займенники на однину та множину / Sort pronouns into singular and plural
  - Instruction: *Розподіліть*
- **quiz** — Ти чи Ви?: Обрати правильну форму звертання — неформальне (ти) чи ввічливе (Ви) / Choose correct address form — informal (ти) vs polite (Ви)
**Anti-patterns (DO NOT generate):**
- ❌ translate: Займенники — про зв'язок з дієсловом, а не переклад

### Pattern: general-reading [§1 (Speech activities — reading)]
**Розуміння тексту** (Reading comprehension)
- **true-false** — Правда чи ні?: Перевірити розуміння тексту або діалогу / Check comprehension of a passage or dialogue
- **quiz** — Відповідь на запитання: Відповісти на запитання за текстом / Answer questions about a text passage


**You MUST use these patterns.** The pedagogy patterns encode how Ukrainian teachers actually test each concept. For each matched pattern:
1. Generate **at least one activity of each recommended type** from the pattern. If the pattern lists divide-words, count-syllables, and odd-one-out — your output MUST include all three.
2. Follow the anti-patterns — if a type is listed under "DO NOT generate", do NOT use it for this topic.
3. Use the Ukrainian instruction (назва / instruction_uk) when the level allows Ukrainian instructions.

## Quality Rules

**ACTIVITY COUNT MINIMUMS (non-negotiable, audit-enforced):**
- **Total: 10 activities.** Inline: 4–6. Workbook: 6–9. The audit gate FAILS the module if you ship fewer.
- **Type diversity: workbook MUST cover ≥5 distinct activity types.** A wall of quizzes is rejected. Quiz + true-false combined ≤ 25% of workbook.
- **Match the inline markers exactly.** Every `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: id -->` marker in the prose needs a matching inline activity with that exact id. Skipping markers means the lesson tab is broken.

**ITEM COUNT MINIMUMS (non-negotiable, per-activity):**
- **Default minimum: 6 items per activity.** Quiz, fill-in, match-up, true-false, anagram, error-correction, translate, cloze, mark-the-words, divide-words, count-syllables, odd-one-out, group-sort categories: all ≥ 6.
- **Lower minimums for specific types only:** order = 3+ items (dialogue lines), observe = 2+ examples, pick-syllables = 4+ syllables, watch-and-repeat = 3+ items, essay-response/critical-analysis = 1 prompt.
- If you can't think of enough items, add more examples from the module's vocabulary and content. NEVER ship a 1-item or 2-item activity unless its type cap explicitly allows it.
- **Exactly 4 options per quiz question at A2+** — enough to prevent guessing, not so many to overwhelm. A1 allows 3-4.
- **BINARY CONCEPTS (e.g., НВ/ДВ, masculine/feminine, true/false):** Do NOT use `quiz` with only 2 options — use `true-false` (for statement evaluation) or `group-sort` (for categorization) instead. Quiz type requires 4 options at A2+.

**Instructions match learner level:**
1. **A1.1 (M01-M07):** Instructions in ENGLISH. The learner is a complete beginner who cannot read Ukrainian yet. They are learning the alphabet and first words. Use activity types: image-to-letter, letter-grid, match-up (letter↔sound), quiz (in English about Ukrainian sounds/letters). Anna Ohoiko's pronunciation videos should be referenced where relevant.
2. **A1.2-A1.3 (M08-M21):** Instructions in simple English with Ukrainian key terms in bold. Learner knows basic words but not grammar terminology.
3. **A1.4+ (M22-M55):** Instructions can be in simple Ukrainian with English translation in parentheses.
4. **A2+:** Instructions in Ukrainian.
5. **B1+:** Full Ukrainian, no English.

**Other rules:**
6. **No duplicate options** — each option in a quiz item must be unique
7. **Answer must be in options** — for quiz items, `correct` must be a valid index. For fill-in with options, `answer` must appear in `options`.
8. **Plausible distractors** — wrong options should be real Ukrainian words that test the specific skill. Not random words.
9. **Min 6 pairs for match-up** — to prevent trivial elimination
10. **Explanations for true-false and error-correction** — help the learner understand WHY
11. **Test LANGUAGE, not trivia** — exercises must test Ukrainian language skills. Not "In what year..." factual recall.

## Live Verification Tools (MCP)

You have access to RAG-powered MCP tools to verify Ukrainian language constructs **live as you write**. The research phase is already complete; use these tools strictly for targeted verification to ensure zero Russianisms, accurate grammar, and authentic usage.

**Core Tools:**
- `mcp_rag_verify_words` / `mcp_rag_verify_word` / `mcp_rag_verify_lemma` — VESUM morphological dictionary (409K lemmas, 6.7M forms). Returns full declension/conjugation.
- `mcp_rag_search_text` — Ukrainian school textbooks (Grades 1-11, 23K chunks).
- `mcp_rag_search_literary` — Primary literary sources (chronicles, poetry, legal texts).
- `mcp_rag_query_pravopys` — Official Ukrainian orthography rules (Правопис 2019).
- `mcp_rag_query_wikipedia` — Ukrainian Wikipedia.

**Dictionary Tools (NEW — use these for quality):**
- `mcp_rag_search_style_guide` — **Антоненко-Давидович (279 entries). HIGH PRIORITY.** Identifies calques and Russianisms. Use when unsure if a phrase is natural Ukrainian.
- `mcp_rag_query_cefr_level` — PULS CEFR vocabulary (5.9K words). Check if a word is level-appropriate (A1/A2/B1 etc.).
- `mcp_rag_search_definitions` — СУМ-11 (127K entries). Look up exact Ukrainian definitions.
- `mcp_rag_search_etymology` — Грінченко (67K entries). Historical forms, etymology.
- `mcp_rag_search_idioms` — Фразеологічний (25K entries). Find natural Ukrainian idioms.
- `mcp_rag_search_synonyms` — Ukrajinet WordNet (122K synsets). Synonyms, antonyms.
- `mcp_rag_translate_en_uk` — Балла EN→UK (79K entries). English→Ukrainian translations.
- `mcp_rag_query_grac` — GRAC corpus (2B tokens). Check word frequency, collocations, concordance. Use when unsure if a collocation is natural.
- `mcp_rag_query_ulif` — ULIF morphological paradigms. Full declension/conjugation tables. Use when verify_lemma isn't enough.
- `mcp_rag_query_r2u` — Russian→Ukrainian equivalents. Use when you suspect a word might be a Russicism — finds the proper Ukrainian alternative.

**WHEN to use tools (Specific Triggers):**

1. **Suspected Russianisms or Surzhyk (HIGH PRIORITY):**
   - *Trigger:* You are about to use a word that sounds similar to Russian, a calque, or you are unsure of its exact Ukrainian equivalent.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_search_style_guide` first (it knows calques). Then `mcp_rag_query_r2u` for the proper Ukrainian equivalent. Then verify with `mcp_rag_verify_words`.
   - *Example:* Checking *приймати участь* (calque) → *брати участь* (correct).

2. **Vocabulary Level Check:**
   - *Trigger:* You are writing for A1/A2 and want to ensure words are level-appropriate.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_query_cefr_level` to verify the word's CEFR level.

3. **Grammar & Morphology Doubts:**
   - *Trigger:* You are unsure about a case ending, irregular plural, or conjugation.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_verify_lemma` to pull the complete declension/conjugation.

4. **Natural Expressions:**
   - *Trigger:* You need a natural idiom or collocation for a dialogue.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_search_idioms` for Ukrainian expressions, `mcp_rag_search_synonyms` for word variety.

5. **Drafting Grammar Rules:**
   - *Trigger:* You are explaining a spelling or phonetic rule.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_query_pravopys` to confirm the exact 2019 standard.

6. **Checking Collocations & Frequency:**
   - *Trigger:* You want to confirm a word combination is actually used by native speakers.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_query_grac` with mode='collocations' to see real-world usage.

**MANDATORY Verification (these are NOT optional):**

7. **Letter/Sound Decomposition (ALWAYS VERIFY):**
   - *Trigger:* You are listing the letters, sounds, or syllables of ANY Ukrainian word.
   - *Action:* BEFORE writing the decomposition, call `mcp_rag_verify_word` on that word. The response shows the exact letter forms. Use ONLY what the tool returns. NEVER decompose a word from memory — your pre-training has wrong letter mappings (e.g., confusing и/і, я/а in specific words). This is the #1 source of errors.
   - *Example:* Before writing 'вулиця has letters В, У, Л...', call `mcp_rag_verify_word("вулиця")` and copy the letters from the result.

8. **Phonetic Claims (ALWAYS VERIFY):**
   - *Trigger:* You are stating how a letter sounds in a specific word, how many syllables a word has, or where stress falls.
   - *Action:* Call `mcp_rag_verify_word` to confirm. Ukrainian letters like є, ї, я, ю change sound value depending on position (after consonant vs word-initial). Do NOT guess — verify each claim.

9. **ANY Factual Claim About Ukrainian (VERIFY WHEN POSSIBLE):**
   - *Trigger:* You are stating a grammar rule, exception, or linguistic fact.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_query_pravopys` or `mcp_rag_search_text` to confirm. If you can't verify it, flag with `<!-- VERIFY: claim -->`.

**Efficiency Rules:**
- **Batch your checks:** Use `mcp_rag_verify_words` with 5-15 words at once.
- **Do NOT verify basic words:** *мама*, *стіл*, *робити* don't need checking.
- **Zero invention:** If VESUM doesn't know a word, don't use it.
- **Target: 10-20 tool calls per module** (was 8-15; mandatory checks added).

IMPORTANT: After using tools, output your COMPLETE module content as plain text. Do NOT narrate your tool usage. Just output the final module content.


**Verification checklist:**
1. Run `verify_words` on all Ukrainian words in your exercises — every word must exist in VESUM
2. Run `query_cefr_level` on any word you're unsure about — it must be a1-appropriate
3. For fill-in answers and distractors, verify the exact form (case, number, gender) with `verify_lemma`

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FINAL CHECKLIST — verify before emitting YAML

Walk through this checklist explicitly before you start emitting. If ANY box is unchecked, fix it FIRST.

- [ ] My output has **at least 4** inline activities (one per `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY -->` marker).
- [ ] My output has **at least 6** workbook activities.
- [ ] **Total ≥ 10.**
- [ ] **Every** activity has **at least 6** items, pairs, or statements (except types with explicitly lower caps: order=3, observe=2, pick-syllables=4, watch-and-repeat=3, essay-response=1).
- [ ] The module (inline + workbook combined) uses **at least 0 distinct activity types** (or 4+ when 0 = 0 and the workbook size allows it). I am NOT shipping a wall of quizzes.
- [ ] Quiz + true-false combined are roughly ≤25% of the workbook (quality target — lean on `WORKBOOK_PRIORITY_TYPES` instead).
- [ ] I prioritized types from `WORKBOOK_PRIORITY_TYPES` (heavy practice formats), not just easy-to-write quizzes.
- [ ] I used ZERO types from `FORBIDDEN_ACTIVITY_TYPES`.
- [ ] All fill-in items use `____` blanks, NOT `{word}` curly-brace syntax.
- [ ] My inline count is between 4 and 6. I did NOT create more injection markers than 6.
- [ ] Every Ukrainian word in my items appears in the prose or in `PLAN_VOCABULARY`.
- [ ] At B1+, all instructions are in Ukrainian (no English fallback).

If you cannot tick all of these, REGENERATE the activities BEFORE outputting. Shipping under-spec means the build rejects you and the heal loop has to redo your work — wasting compute.
