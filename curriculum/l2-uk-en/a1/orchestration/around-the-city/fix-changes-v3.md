## Applied Fixes

1. [File: content] Verified text uses **ліворуч / праворуч** consistently (Issue 3).
2. [File: content] Verified "Grammar Alert" explains prepositions using "case endings" and Genitive examples, correcting the false "Locative or Accusative" claim (Issue 2).
3. [File: content] Verified Instrumental cases ("за тим будинком", "велосипедом") are NOT present in Scenarios 2 & 3, matching the required fix (Issue 1).
4. [File: activities] Verified "Navigation Basics" options match the text (standardized to `ліворуч/праворуч`) (Issue 3).
5. [File: activities] Verified "Transportation Phrases" distractors do not use valid Instrumental forms like `машиною` (replaced with `машина` in current version) (Issue 4).
6. [File: vocabulary] Replaced entire vocabulary list. The input file contained unrelated words (`Дорошенко`, `обожнювати`) and missed key terms (`вулиця`, `аптека`, `пошта`). New list strictly aligns with text and Plan requirements.

## Fixes NOT Applied

- Content and Activities files were found to **already have the fixes applied** (likely from a previous iteration). They were output in their verified, correct state to ensure system synchronization. No "new" edits were required for these two files, but they are included as "Complete fixed files" per instructions.

## Files Changed: content, activities, vocabulary
