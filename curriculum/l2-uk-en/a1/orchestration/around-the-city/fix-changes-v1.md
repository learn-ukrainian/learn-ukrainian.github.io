## Applied Fixes

1. [File: content] Section 3 "Location and 'Fixed Phrases'": Updated grammar explanation to "Notice how these often use specific case endings..." — Addresses "Incorrect Grammar Explanation" (Issue 2).
2. [File: content] Scenario 2: Changed "за тим будинком" to "біля того будинку" — Addresses "Grammar Scope Creep" (Issue 1).
3. [File: content] Scenario 3: Changed "Велосипедом" to "На велосипеді" — Addresses "Grammar Scope Creep" (Issue 1).
4. [File: activities] Activity "Transportation Phrases": Replaced Instrumental distractors (`велосипедом`, `машиною`, `трамваєм`, etc.) with Nominative or Locative/Accusative options — Addresses "Ambiguous Activity Distractors" (Issue 4).

## Fixes NOT Applied (explain why)

- The review requested standardizing to `ліворуч/праворуч` and updating "Mini-Dialogue 1" and the table, but the content *already* used `ліворуч/праворуч` exclusively. No changes were needed to achieve consistency.
- The review's claim that the original text stated "These combine with locative or accusative cases..." could not be verified in the provided file (it correctly said "Genitive Case"). I applied the suggested clearer wording regardless, as instructed.

## Files Changed: content, activities
