## Fixes NOT Applied

- No modifications made to `vocabulary.yaml`. The review noted missing vocabulary in the plan analysis but did not explicitly request adding items to the YAML file in the "Fix Plan" section, only to the content text (for "хліб"). The "Ukrainian Language Issues" table listed items to remove from activities, which was done.

## Files Changed: content, activities
## Files Unchanged: vocabulary
