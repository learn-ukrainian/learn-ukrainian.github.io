## Warm-up

Imagine you're in a new Ukrainian apartment. You're standing in the kitchen. Your friend hands you a phone. «Це телефон,» they say. You point to a cup on the table: «Ця чашка?» They nod. You gesture to a window across the room: «Те вікно?» Again, they agree.

You've just used Ukrainian demonstratives. Words that point to things. Words that say «this one» or «that one.» Imagine pointing: «Це чашка» (This is a cup) vs «Ця чашка» (This cup). In Ukrainian, these pointing words change based on what you're pointing at. Not just near or far, but masculine, feminine, or neuter.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to navigate your entire living space in Ukrainian, pointing to objects and naming them with confidence. Let's start with the closest things around you.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> You already learned about noun gender in Module 03. Now you'll use that knowledge every time you point to something! Ukrainian demonstratives change based on gender: one form for masculine, another for feminine, another for neuter, and a special plural form for all genders.

## Presentation

### The Near Demonstratives: цей, ця, це, ці (this/these)

When you point to something **close to you**, use forms of **цей** (tsey):

| Gender           | Singular | Example     | Transliteration | English     |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| **Masculine**    | цей      | цей стілець | tsey stilets'   | this chair  |
| **Feminine**     | ця       | ця чашка    | tsya chashka    | this cup    |
| **Neuter**       | це       | це вікно    | tse vikno       | this window |
| **Plural (all)** | ці       | ці ключі    | tsi klyuchi     | these keys  |

The pattern is simple: match the demonstrative to the noun's gender. If the noun is masculine, use **цей**. If feminine, use **ця**. If neuter, use **це**. If plural (any gender), use **ці**.

**Quick Examples:**

- Цей телефон (Tsey telefon) — This phone (m)
- Ця сумка (Tsya sumka) — This bag (f)
- Це дзеркало (Tse dzerkalo) — This mirror (n)
- Ці ключі (Tsi klyuchi) — These keys (pl)

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> The word **телефон** (telefon) in Ukrainian is masculine, just like many technology words. But **лампа** (lamp) is feminine. Why? Ukrainian inherited gender from ancient patterns where objects associated with certain uses had certain genders. Lamps were traditionally feminine, tools masculine, and abstract concepts neuter.

### The Far Demonstratives: той, та, те, ті (that/those)

For objects located **at a distance**, we use forms of **той** (toy):

| Gender           | Singular | Example     | Transliteration | English     |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| **Masculine**    | той      | той стілець | toy stilets'    | that chair  |
| **Feminine**     | та       | та чашка    | ta chashka      | that cup    |
| **Neuter**       | те       | те вікно    | te vikno        | that window |
| **Plural (all)** | ті       | ті ключі    | ti klyuchi      | those keys  |

Notice the pattern: **той** (m), **та** (f), **те** (n), **ті** (pl). Same logic as **цей**, just for distant objects.

> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** «Це is always 'this.'»
> **Fact:** **Це** has two jobs! It's the neuter form of «this» (це вікно = this window). But it also means «this is» in general statements (Це книга = This is a book). Context tells you which one!

### Gender Agreement Matters

You already learned gender in Module 03. Now you're using it in real sentences. Every time you point to something, your demonstrative must match the noun's gender.

**Kitchen Objects:**

- Цей ніж (tsey nizh) — this knife (m)
- Ця ложка (tsya lozhka) — this spoon (f)
- Ця тарілка (tsya tarilka) — this plate (f)
- Ця склянка (tsya sklyanka) — this glass (f)
- Ця пляшка (tsya plyashka) — this bottle (f)
- Ця плита (tsya plyta) — this stove (f)

**Furniture:**

- Той диван (toy dyvan) — that couch (m)
- Та шафа (ta shafa) — that wardrobe (f)
- Те крісло (te krislo) — that armchair (n)

**Room Parts:**

- Ця стіна (tsya stina) — this wall (f)
- Ця стелю... wait! Стеля is feminine! → **Ця стеля** (tsya stelya) — this ceiling (f)
- Ця підлога (tsya pidloha) — this floor (f)
- Це вікно (tse vikno) — this window (n)

> ⚡ **Pro Tip**
>
> Most household objects ending in -а or -я are feminine (чашка, ложка, виделка, сумка). Most ending in consonants are masculine (ніж, стіл, телефон, ключ). Most ending in -о are neuter (вікно, дзеркало). This pattern works 90% of the time!

## Practice

### In the Kitchen

You're cooking with a Ukrainian friend. They hand you items and you name them:

— Що це? (Shcho tse?) — What is this?
— **Це ніж.** (Tse nizh.) — This is a knife.

— а це? (A tse?) — And this?
— **Це виделка.** (Tse vydelka.) — This is a fork.

— а ця? (A tsya?) — And this one? (feminine implied)
— **Ця ложка.** (Tsya lozhka.) — This spoon.

Notice how **«Це»** introduces objects (This is a...), but **«ця»** points to something specific (this one, feminine).

### In the Living Room

You're describing furniture to someone on the phone:

— Де твій телефон? (De tviy telefon?) — Where is your phone?
— **Ось той стіл. Телефон там.** (Os' toy stil. Telefon tam.) — Here is that table. The phone is there.

— а пульт? (A pul't?) — And the remote?
— **Ось диван. Пульт там.** (Os' dyvan. Pul't tam.) — Here is the couch. The remote is there.

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: The Witcher**
>
> In the Ukrainian dub of *The Witcher*, when Geralt points to objects, he uses perfect demonstrative agreement. «Цей меч» (this sword, m), «Та книга» (that book, f). Even fictional monster hunters follow Ukrainian grammar!

### Everyday Scenarios

**At Home:**

- Це моя сумка. (Tse moya sumka.) — This is my bag.
- Той рюкзак теж мій. (Toy ryukzak tezh miy.) — That backpack is also mine.
- Ця лампа не працює. (Tsya lampa ne pratsyuye.) — This lamp doesn't work.

**Looking for Something:**

- Де мій телефон? (De miy telefon?) — Where is my phone?
- Ось! Цей телефон! (Os'! Tsey telefon!) — Here! This phone!

**Asking About Objects:**

- Що це? (Shcho tse?) — What is this?
- Це холодильник. (Tse kholodyl'nyk.) — This is a refrigerator.

### Mini-Dialogue 1: Lost Keys

— Де мої ключі? *(De moyi klyuchi?)* — Where are my keys?
— Ці ключі? *(Tsi klyuchi?)* — These keys?
— Так! Дякую! *(Tak! Dyakuyu!)* — Yes! Thank you!

### Mini-Dialogue 2: Choosing Furniture

— Цей стілець гарний? *(Tsey stilets' harnyy?)* — Is this chair nice?
— Так! Цей стілець гарний. *(Tak! Tsey stilets' harnyy.)* — Yes! This chair is nice.
— а те крісло? *(A te krislo?)* — And that armchair?
— Те крісло теж гарне. *(Te krislo tezh harne.)* — That armchair is also nice.

### Mini-Dialogue 3: Showing Around

— Це моя кімната. *(Tse moya kimnata.)* — This is my room.
— О! Ця лампа дуже гарна! *(O! Tsya lampa duzhe harna!)* — Oh! This lamp is very nice!
— Дякую! Той годинник теж новий. *(Dyakuyu! Toy hodynnyk tezh novyy.)* — Thank you! That clock is also new.

## Cultural Insight

### The Ukrainian Home

**Historical Context:** Ukrainian homes reflect a blend of Soviet-era apartment design and modern European styles. During the Soviet period (1922-1991), most urban Ukrainians were assigned apartments in large residential blocks called «хрущовки» (khrushchyovky, named after Soviet leader Khrushchev). These apartments were small, standardized, and built quickly to house the growing urban population. Many Ukrainians still live in these buildings, though they've been modernized over the decades.

After Ukrainian independence in 1991, housing styles began to diversify. New construction follows European standards, with larger apartments, better layouts, and modern amenities. However, Soviet-era apartments remain the most common type of housing in Ukrainian cities.

**Modern Reality:** Most Ukrainians live in apartments (квартири), not houses. In cities like Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, and Odesa, apartments dominate the housing market. Private houses (будинки) are more common in villages and small towns, but even there, the Soviet apartment legacy is visible.

The typical Ukrainian apartment layout includes:

- **Кухня** (kukhnya) — Kitchen, the social heart of the home
- **Вітальня** (vital'nya) — Living room
- **Спальня** (spal'nya) — Bedroom
- **Ванна** (vanna) — Bathroom

In Ukrainian culture, it's customary to remove shoes when entering someone's home. The host will often offer **тапочки** (tapochky, slippers). When visiting, bringing a small gift like flowers or chocolates is appreciated.

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> When you visit a Ukrainian friend's apartment, you'll hear: «Заходь! Це наша кухня. Ця мікрохвильовка нова. Той холодильник старий.» (Come in! This is our kitchen. This microwave is new. That refrigerator is old.) Demonstratives are everywhere in daily conversation!

### Household Technology

**The Modernization Wave:** Ukrainian homes have rapidly modernized since independence in 1991, and especially after 2014 when Ukraine began aligning more closely with European standards. During the Soviet era, many modern appliances were scarce or low-quality. Today, Ukrainian homes are equipped with the same technology you'd find in any European country.

**Linguistic Note on Gender:** Unlike English, Ukrainian assigns gender to all these modern words. This can seem arbitrary to English speakers, but there are patterns. Technology words borrowed from English or French tend to be masculine if they end in consonants (**телефон**, **комп'ютер**). Appliances with the diminutive suffix -ка tend to be feminine (**мікрохвильовка**). This is because -ка is historically a feminine ending in Ukrainian.

Common household objects include:

- **Телефон** (telefon) — phone (mobile or landline)
- **Комп'ютер** (komp'yuter) — computer
- **Мікрохвильовка** (mikrokhvyl'ovka) — microwave
- **Праска** (praska) — iron

## Production

Now practice pointing to objects around you. Look at your room or workspace. Point and name:

**Near you:**

- Цей... (this + masculine object)
- Ця... (this + feminine object)
- Це... (this + neuter object)
- Ці... (these + any plural objects)

**Far from you:**

- Той... (that + masculine object)
- Та... (that + feminine object)
- Те... (that + neuter object)
- Ті... (those + any plural objects)

Try building full sentences: «Це моя чашка. Та чашка не моя.» (This is my cup. That cup is not mine.)

6. **Research notes** (if exists): `# Research Notes: M05 — My World: Objects

**Module:** A1 M05 | **Topic:** Demonstrative pronouns + household vocabulary
**Research Date:** 2026-02-07

## State Standard References

### §4.3.3 — Demonstrative Pronouns (Вказівні займенники)

Ukrainian demonstrative pronouns distinguish proximal (near) and distal (far):

- **Proximal:** цей (m), ця (f), це (n), ці (pl) — "this/these"
- **Distal:** той (m), та (f), те (n), ті (pl) — "that/those"

Demonstratives agree with the noun in gender and number (nominative case).

### §4.2.1 — Gender Agreement

Demonstrative + noun agreement follows standard gender patterns:
- Masculine nouns (consonant ending): цей стілець, той ніж
- Feminine nouns (-а/-я ending): ця чашка, та лампа
- Neuter nouns (-о/-е ending): це вікно, те крісло
- Plurals (any gender): ці ключі, ті двері

### §4.3.4 — Dual Function of «це»

«Це» serves two roles:
1. Neuter demonstrative: це вікно (this window)
2. Predicative particle: Це книга (This is a book) — from M04 zero copula

This dual function is a common source of confusion for A1 learners.

## Cultural Hooks

### Хрущовки (Khrushchyovkas)
Soviet-era apartment blocks built 1958-1985, named after Nikita Khrushchev. Standardized 1-3 bedroom layouts. Still the most common housing type in Ukrainian cities. Typical features: small kitchens (5-7 m²), low ceilings (2.5m), thin walls. Being gradually modernized or replaced in major cities.

### Ukrainian Home Culture
- Removing shoes at the entrance is universal; hosts offer тапочки (slippers)
- Kitchen (кухня) is the social hub for conversation over tea
- Gifts (flowers, chocolates) expected when visiting
- Modern Ukrainian homes blend Soviet-era layouts with European renovation styles

## Vocabulary Verification

Key frequency items verified against corpus data:
- чашка, ложка, виделка, ніж — high-frequency kitchen vocabulary
- телефон, комп'ютер — technology vocabulary (borrowed, masculine by consonant-ending pattern)
- мікрохвильовка — feminine by -ка suffix (productive feminine suffix in Ukrainian)
- стілець, диван, крісло, ліжко — furniture representing all three genders

**Do not proceed until you have read every line of the content and every activity item.**

> **ANTI-STALE-REVIEW RULE**: This file may have been fixed since a previous review. You MUST review the CURRENT state of the files, not repeat findings from a prior review. If an issue was cited before but is now fixed, it must NOT appear in your review. Every finding must be verifiable by quoting the actual current content.

## STEP 1: PLAN VERIFICATION

Cross-check content against the plan file:

1. **Outline compliance**: Is every section from `content_outline` present as an H2/H3?
2. **Vocabulary scope**: List every Ukrainian vocabulary word taught in the content. Compare against `vocabulary_hints.required` in the plan. Flag any word NOT in the plan.
3. **Grammar scope**: What grammar does this module teach? What grammar from LATER modules appears in examples or dialogues? (This is scope creep — flag it.)
4. **Objectives**: Are all learning objectives from the plan addressed in the content?

Report findings as:
```
Plan-Content Alignment: [PASS/FAIL]
- Sections: [all present / missing: X, Y]
- Vocabulary: [X/Y from plan used, Z extra words found]
- Grammar scope: [clean / scope creep: specific items]
- Objectives: [all covered / missing: X]
```

---

## STEP 2: DEEP VERIFICATION (Line by Line)

### Ukrainian Sentences
Go through the file section by section. For EACH Ukrainian sentence:
- Is grammar correct? (cases, verb forms, agreement)
- Does it sound natural? (not robotic, not calqued from English)
- Are there Russianisms? (check against list below)
- Is vocabulary appropriate for the level?

### English Sentences
- Is it clear and accessible?
- Warm tutor voice or cold textbook?
- Over-explaining simple things? Under-explaining complex ones?

### IPA Transcriptions (if present)
- Every transcription must be checked for correct stress placement
- Ukrainian stress is unpredictable — verify each one
- Watch for English approximations instead of Ukrainian phonemes

### Activities (EVERY ITEM)

**CRITICAL: Read the actual YAML file line by line.** Do NOT assume what the file contains — read it. If a previous review said "add English cues" but the file already has them, acknowledge the fix is present. Never cite an issue that doesn't exist in the CURRENT file.

Check each activity item individually:
- **quiz**: Grammatically correct? Exactly one correct answer? Options plausible?
- **fill-in**: Sentence correct with answer filled in? Only ONE valid answer given the context/cues? Distractors plausible?
- **match-up**: All pairs correct? No duplicates?
- **true-false**: True statements actually true? False clearly false?
- **unjumble**: Answer forms a correct, natural sentence?
- **group-sort**: Items correctly categorized?
- **anagram**: Solution correct? Hint clear?

Count as you go. You MUST report how many items you checked.

**Verification rule**: For EVERY issue you cite, quote the EXACT line from the file. If you cannot quote it, the issue does not exist.

---

## STEP 3: AUTO-FAIL CHECKLIST

Check EVERY category. Report "[CLEAN]" or list specific findings.

### Russianisms
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| кушать | їсти |
| приймати участь | брати участь |
| самий кращий | найкращий |
| слідуючий | наступний |
| на протязі | протягом |
| любий (any) | будь-який |
| отвічати | відповідати |
| вообще | взагалі |
| получати | отримувати |
| відноситися | ставитися |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Calques
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| робити сенс | мати сенс |
| брати місце | відбуватися |
| це є | це (usually) |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Grammar Scope Violations
At module 5, students know ONLY modules 1-4. Any grammar from later modules is scope creep.
- Past tense (if not yet taught)
- Cases not yet introduced
- Verb forms not yet taught

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list specific violations with line numbers]

### Activity Errors
- Wrong answer marked as correct
- Multiple valid answers but only one accepted
- Grammatically incorrect sentences
- Duplicate items

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with activity number and item number]

### Beginner Safety ("Would I Continue?" Test)
| Question | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Did I feel overwhelmed? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Were instructions clear? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Did I get quick wins? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Was Ukrainian scary? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Would I come back tomorrow? | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Total** | **X/5** |

Emotional beats found:
- Welcome/orientation: [yes/no, where]
- Curiosity trigger: [yes/no, where]
- Quick wins: [count, where]
- Encouragement: [count, where]
- Progress marker: [yes/no, where]

---

## STEP 4: SCORE DIMENSIONS

**Score ONLY after completing Steps 1-3.** Each score must link to specific findings.

### Scoring Rules
- **9-10**: Excellent — no issues found in this dimension
- **7-8**: Good — minor issues found
- **5-6**: Needs work — multiple issues
- **<5**: Serious problems — major rewrite needed
- **If you found 3 grammar errors, Language cannot be 9**
- **If scope creep found, Relevance and Pedagogy cannot be 8+**

### Auto-Fail Thresholds
| Dimension | Auto-fail if below |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Experience Quality | <7 |
| Coherence | <7 |
| Relevance | <7 |
| Educational | <7 |
| Language | <8 |
| Pedagogy | <7 |
| Immersion | <6 |
| Activities | <7 |
| Richness | <6 |
| Beginner Safety | <7 |
| LLM Fingerprint | <7 |
| Linguistic Accuracy | <9 |

### Weighted Overall Score
```
Overall = (Experience × 1.5 + Coherence × 1.0 + Relevance × 1.0 + Educational × 1.2 +
          Language × 1.1 + Pedagogy × 1.2 + Immersion × 1.0 + Activities × 1.3 +
          Richness × 0.9 + Beginner_Safety × 1.3 + LLM × 1.0 + Linguistic_Accuracy × 1.5) / 14.0
```

**Quality target: 9.0+ overall AND no dimension below its auto-fail threshold.**
**If the score is below 9.0, you MUST provide a Fix Plan (see output format) with specific actions to reach 9/10.** The fix plan drives the iteration loop — Claude will send fixes to Gemini until the module reaches 9.0+.
