## Scores

| # | Dimension | Score | Auto-fail | Evidence |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Experience Quality | 6/10 | <7 | Content is readable, but activities will frustrate learners due to missing vocabulary. |
| 2 | Coherence | 4/10 | <7 | Major disconnect: Activities test ~12 words not introduced in the lesson. |
| 3 | Relevance | 9/10 | <7 | Topic is highly relevant for survival in Ukraine. |
| 4 | Educational | 6/10 | <7 | Good explanations of cases, but incomplete vocabulary coverage for the assigned tasks. |
| 5 | Language | 9/10 | <8 | Ukrainian naturalness is high. |
| 6 | Pedagogy | 4/10 | <7 | Testing untaught material (both vocabulary and grammar). |
| 7 | Immersion | 8/10 | <6 | Cultural notes on Borscht and Markets are excellent. |
| 8 | Activities | 4/10 | <7 | Valid formats, but invalid content integration (testing unknown words). |
| 9 | Richness | 7/10 | <6 | Good depth in content, but activities demand more than is provided. |
| 10 | Beginner Safety | 4/10 | <7 | "Would I Continue?" 2/5. Learners will feel stupid failing quizzes on words they never saw. |
| 11 | LLM Fingerprint | 8/10 | <7 | Generally structured well, typical LLM mismatch between sections. |
| 12 | Linguistic Accuracy | 9/10 | <9 | Grammar in examples is correct. |

**Weighted Overall:** 6.43/10

## Auto-Fail Checklist Results

- Russianisms: [CLEAN]
- Calques: [CLEAN]
- Grammar scope: **[FAIL]** Activities test Instrumental case (`карткою`), Imperative (`Покажіть`), and untaught verbs (`плачу`, `приймаєте`, `замовляти`).
- Activity errors: **[FAIL]** Multiple activities rely on untaught vocabulary.
- Beginner safety: 2/5

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Massive Vocabulary Gap (Activities vs Content)
- **Location**: Activities (Match-up "Non-Food Items", Quiz "Shopping Situations", Fill-in "Café Dialogue")
- **Original**: Words used: `пакет`, `каса`, `гроші`, `чек`, `картка`, `знижка`, `полиця`, `кошик`, `візок`, `список`, `рахунок`, `офіціант`.
- **Problem**: **None** of these words are listed in the `Presentation` or `Essential Vocabulary` sections of the module. A learner cannot solve these activities based on the lesson.
- **Fix**: Add a new vocabulary subsection "Shopping Essentials" (Requisites) to Part 1 or Part 3 containing these terms.

### Issue 2: Untaught Grammar in Activities
- **Location**: Activity `quiz` "Shopping Situations" / Item 5
- **Original**: "How can you say accurately 'I pay by card'? ... Я плачу карткою"
- **Problem**: The Instrumental case (`карткою`) is not taught in this module. Research notes allow it as a *fixed phrase*, but it must be explicitly taught in the content first.
- **Fix**: Add a "Pro Tip: Paying" box in the content teaching `готівкою` (cash) vs `карткою` (card) as fixed phrases.

### Issue 3: Missing Required Vocabulary
- **Location**: Content / Part 1
- **Original**: Lists: Хліб, Сир, Яйце.
- **Problem**: Plan requires `молоко` (milk). It is missing.
- **Fix**: Add `Молоко` to Part 1 (Basics) or Part 3 examples.

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test: 2/5
- Overwhelmed? **Fail** (Activities are impossible without guessing)
- Instructions clear? **Pass**
- Quick wins? **Fail** (Quiz failure inevitable)
- Ukrainian scary? **Fail** (Sudden undefined words)
- Come back tomorrow? **Fail**

## Fix Plan to Reach 9/10

### Coherence & Pedagogy: 4/10 → 9/10

**What to fix:**
1.  **Section "Presentation"**: Add a new list **"5. Shopping Essentials (У магазині)"**.
    - Content: `Кошик` (basket), `Візок` (cart/trolley), `Пакет` (bag), `Каса` (checkout), `Чек` (receipt), `Гроші` (money), `Ціна` (price), `Знижка` (discount).
2.  **Section "Presentation"**: Add `Молоко` (milk) to "2. Basics".
3.  **Section "Practice"**: Add a "Pro Tip" box before the activities.
    - Title: "Cash or Card?"
    - Text: "Use these fixed phrases for paying: **готівкою** (by cash) and **карткою** (by card)."
4.  **Activity "Café Dialogue"**: Ensure `рахунок` (bill) and `офіціант` (waiter) are either taught in content (e.g., in the "At the Restaurant" dialogue intro) or provided as a hint.
    - Action: Add to "At the Restaurant" dialogue intro: "You ask the **офіціант** (waiter) for the **рахунок** (bill)."

### Beginner Safety: 4/10 → 9/10

**What to fix:**
1.  **Sync Activities**: Ensure every single word in the `match-up` activities is present in the `Essential Vocabulary` lists.

### Projected Overall After Fixes

With these fixes, Coherence, Pedagogy, and Activities scores will jump to 9-10.
Projected Score: **9.2/10**

## Verification Summary

- Content lines read: ~120
- Activity items checked: 30+
- Ukrainian sentences verified: ~40
- IPA transcriptions checked: 12
- Issues found: 3 major (Vocab gap, Grammar creep, Missing plan item)
- Naturalness score recommendation: 9/10

## Verdict

**FAIL**

The module content is well-written but completely disconnected from the activities. The activities test a dozen words and grammatical concepts not introduced in the lesson, which guarantees learner frustration. You must sync the vocabulary lists with the activity requirements.
