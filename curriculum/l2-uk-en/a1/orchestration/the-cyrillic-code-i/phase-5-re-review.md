- **Distractor Quality:** In the quiz, distractors like "pasport" vs "pasnort" vs "paspopt" actively test the specific false friends (N vs H, R vs P).
- **Decolonization:** Clearly states Cyrillic's Bulgarian origin and Kyiv's historical primacy over Moscow, correcting common misconceptions immediately.

## Verdict

**PASS**

This is a model A1.1 module. It is engaging, safe for absolute beginners, and culturally enriched without being overwhelming. The use of international cognates provides immediate positive reinforcement.
