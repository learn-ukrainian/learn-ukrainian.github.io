## Warm-up

You're about to crack a code that 45 million people use every day. The Ukrainian Cyrillic alphabet isn't as foreign as it looks. In fact, you already know how to read about a third of it. Some letters are **True Friends** (they look AND sound like their English equivalents). Some are **False Friends** (they look familiar but make completely different sounds). And some are entirely new.

Think of learning Cyrillic like learning to read again. But this time, it only takes a few hours instead of a few years. By the end of this module, you'll be reading real Ukrainian words. Let's start with the letters you already know.

## Presentation

### The True Friends (7 letters)

These letters look and sound almost identical to their English counterparts. When you see them, read them exactly as you would in English:

| Letter  | Sound             | Example      | English |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| **А а** | /ɑ/ like «father» | м**а**м**а** | mama    |
| **Е е** | /ɛ/ like «bet»    | м**е**тро    | metro   |
| **І і** | /i/ like «meet»   | к**і**но     | cinema  |
| **О о** | /ɔ/ like «soft»   | д**о**ктор   | doctor  |
| **К к** | /k/ like «kite»   | **к**іт      | cat     |
| **М м** | /m/ like «mom»    | **м**аска    | mask    |
| **Т т** | /t/ like «top»    | **т**акт     | tact    |

These are your **True Friends**. When you see А, О, Е, І, К, М, Т, read them just like English. The word **тато** (dad) uses only these letters: T-A-T-O. The word **метро** (metro) also uses letters you'll recognize: M-E-T-R-O. Wait, what about that Р? That's where things get interesting.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> The Cyrillic alphabet wasn't invented by Russians. It was created in the 9th century in Bulgaria by followers of Saints Cyril and Methodius. Ukraine adopted Cyrillic independently through the medieval state of Kyivan Rus'. Russian didn't even exist as a distinct language when Cyrillic was created!

### The False Friends (6 letters)

These letters LOOK like English letters but make COMPLETELY different sounds. This is where English speakers get tripped up:

| Letter  | Looks Like | Actually Says            | Example   | English |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------------------ | --------- | ------- |
| **В в** | B          | /v/ like «van»           | ка**в**а  | coffee  |
| **Н н** | H          | /n/ like «no»            | ба**н**к  | bank    |
| **Р р** | P          | /r/ like «red» (rolled)  | **р**адіо | radio   |
| **С с** | C          | /s/ like «sun»           | **с**уп   | soup    |
| **У у** | Y          | /u/ like «moon»          | с**у**п   | soup    |
| **Х х** | X          | /x/ like Scottish «loch» | **х**ор   | choir   |

The word **банк** (bank) has the False Friend **Н** (sounds like N, not H). So it's pronounced «bank», not «bahk»!

Look at **радіо** (radio): the **Р** looks like a P, but it's actually an R. So it says «radio». Exactly what you'd expect, just with a different letter!

> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** «Russian and Ukrainian are basically the same language.»
> **Fact:** Ukrainian and Russian are as different as Spanish and Portuguese. They share Cyrillic roots, but Ukrainian has unique letters (Ї, Є, Ґ) that Russian doesn't have. They have different grammar and thousands of words that don't exist in Russian.

### The New Letters (6 letters)

These letters are completely new to English speakers. But don't worry. They represent sounds you can make:

| Letter  | Sound           | Example    | English |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| **Б б** | /b/ like «ball» | **б**анан  | banana  |
| **Д д** | /d/ like «dog»  | **д**октор | doctor  |
| **З з** | /z/ like «zoo»  | ва**з**а   | vase    |
| **Л л** | /l/ like «love» | **л**ото   | lotto   |
| **П п** | /p/ like «pet»  | **п**арк   | park    |
| **Ф ф** | /f/ like «fun»  | **ф**ото   | photo   |

The word **футбол** (football) uses several new letters: **Ф** (f), **У** (u, False Friend!), **Т** (t, True Friend), **Б** (b), **О** (o, True Friend), **Л** (l). Put it together: f-u-t-b-o-l. Football!

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.**
>
> The famous Ukrainian video game **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** was made by GSC Game World in Kyiv. In Ukrainian, «stalker» is written **сталкер**. You can decode it using False Friends: С (s), Т (t), А (a), Л (l), К (k), Е (e), Р (r). The game is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone.

## Practice

### Reading International Words

Many words in Ukrainian are international. They're borrowed from Latin, Greek, or English. Once you know the letters, you can read these immediately.

**Places:**
Банк (bank). Парк (park). Кафе (café). Бар (bar). Ресторан (restaurant).

**Food:**
Кава (coffee). Суп (soup). Салат (salad). Тост (toast). Банан (banana). Какао (cocoa). Піца (pizza). Лимон (lemon).

**Technology:**
Метро (metro). Радіо (radio). Телефон (telephone). Інтернет (internet). Фото (photo). Відео (video).

### Mini-Dialogue 1: At the Metro Station

— Тут метро? *(Tut metro?)* — Is the metro here?
— Так, метро. *(Tak, metro.)* — Yes, the metro.

Notice how **метро** looks almost English? That's because it IS almost English. Just written in Cyrillic!

### Mini-Dialogue 2: At a Café

— Кава? *(Kava?)* — Coffee?
— Так, кава. *(Tak, kava.)* — Yes, coffee.

The word **кава** comes from the same root as English «coffee» but took a different path through Turkish and Arabic. In Ukrainian, it sounds like «kava.»

### Decoding Strategies

When you see a word in Cyrillic, your brain might feel overwhelmed at first. Follow these three steps to crack the code:

1.  **Identify the True Friends**: Look for letters like **А, К, М**. These are your anchors. They look and sound exactly like you expect, giving you a head start on the word.
2.  **Beware of the False Friends**: This is where most beginners trip up. When you see a **Р**, consciously tell yourself: «That is an R, not a P.» When you see **В**, remind yourself: «That is a V, not a B.» Slowing down at these letters will prevent common reading errors.
3.  **Trust the Phonetics**: Unlike English, where «cough» and «dough» look similar but sound different, Ukrainian is very consistent. One letter almost always equals one sound. There are no silent letters to worry about here!

## Cultural Insight

### Why Ukrainian Uses Cyrillic

When people see Cyrillic, they often think «Russian alphabet.» But Cyrillic belongs to no single nation. It was created specifically for Slavic peoples. Bulgarians, Serbs, Ukrainians, and others used it centuries before the Russian Empire even existed. In fact, Kyiv was a major center of literacy and culture when Moscow was still just a forest.

Ukrainian Cyrillic has 33 letters. Some exist only in Ukrainian, making the language look distinct on the page compared to its neighbors:

**І і** — Ukrainian has this simple «ee» sound like in «meet».

**Ї ї** — A uniquely Ukrainian sound (we'll learn it in Module 2).

**Є є** — Another uniquely Ukrainian letter.

**Ґ ґ** — A hard «g» sound that Russian lost centuries ago.

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> When you visit **Київ** (Kyiv, note the Ukrainian spelling!), you'll see Cyrillic everywhere: on metro stations, street signs, restaurant menus, and shop windows. The words банк, кафе, бар, ресторан, метро are all around you. And now you can read them!

### The Letter Count

Today you learned **19 letters**. That's more than half the alphabet! Only 14 letters remain for Module 2.

## Production

Now it's time to test your decoding skills. Look at these Ukrainian words and try to read them aloud:

Таксі /tɑkˈsi/ (taxi). Опера /ˈɔpɛrɑ/ (opera). Балет /bɑˈlɛt/ (ballet). Актор /ɑkˈtɔr/ (actor). Паспорт /ˈpɑspɔrt/ (passport). Віза /ˈvizɑ/ (visa). Карта /ˈkɑrtɑ/ (card/map). Комета /kɔˈmɛtɑ/ (comet). Ракета /rɑˈkɛtɑ/ (rocket). Какао /kɑˈkɑɔ/ (cocoa).

Every single one of these is an international word that you already know. Just written in a different alphabet!

# Підсумок

In this module, you learned:

**True Friends** (7 letters): А, Е, І, О, К, М, Т. They look AND sound like English.

**False Friends** (6 letters): В (v), Н (n), Р (r), С (s), У (u), Х (kh). They look familiar but sound different.

**New Letters** (6 letters): Б (b), Д (d), З (z), Л (l), П (p), Ф (f). They are completely new shapes.

You can now read **35 international words** in Ukrainian. The key insight: many «Ukrainian» words are actually international words you already know, just written in Cyrillic.

**Remember:** В is V, not B. Н is N, not H. Р is R, not P. С is S, not C. У is U, not Y. Х is like Scottish «loch.»

6. **Research notes** (if exists): `# Research: The Cyrillic Code I

**Level:** A1 | **Module:** 01
**Researched:** 2026-02-07

## State Standard Reference
- Section: §4.1.1, §4.1.4
- §4.1.1: Український алфавіт. Друковані та писані літери. Великі і малі літери: Київ, київський, Олена, олівець, Україна, українець.
- §4.1.4: Голосні та приголосні звуки — вимова голосних у наголошеній і ненаголошеній позиціях.
- Level placement: Confirmed A1 — alphabet and letter-sound correspondence are the very first phonetics/graphics requirements in the State Standard.

## Vocabulary Check
- Core words: так, банк, метро, кафе, кава, парк, бар, факт, план — all high-frequency international/borrowed words
- Frequency source: These are international loanwords widely used in everyday Ukrainian; confirmed high-frequency via lcorp.ulif.org.ua
- No surprises: All words are appropriate for absolute beginners due to cognate nature

## Cultural Hook (2 facts)
- **Fact 1:** The Cyrillic alphabet was created in the 9th century in Bulgaria by followers of Saints Cyril and Methodius — NOT by Russians. Ukraine adopted Cyrillic independently through Kyivan Rus'. The Russian language didn't exist as a distinct language when Cyrillic was created.
  - Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script, https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Кирилиця
  - How to use: In the Cultural Insight section — decolonization point, already integrated as "Did You Know?" callout

- **Fact 2:** Ukrainian has 4 unique letters not found in Russian (Ґ, Є, І, Ї), and Russian has 4 letters not found in Ukrainian (Ё, Ъ, Ы, Э). These alphabets are distinct systems adapted for different languages.
  - Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_alphabet
  - How to use: In the Cultural Insight section about unique Ukrainian letters, already integrated

## Cross-references
- Connects to: a1-02 (The Cyrillic Code II) — remaining 14 letters
- Prepares for: Reading practice in all subsequent A1 modules

**Do not proceed until you have read every line of the content and every activity item.**

> **ANTI-STALE-REVIEW RULE**: This file may have been fixed since a previous review. You MUST review the CURRENT state of the files, not repeat findings from a prior review. If an issue was cited before but is now fixed, it must NOT appear in your review. Every finding must be verifiable by quoting the actual current content.

## Audit Metrics (Facts from Claude)

Immersion:        varies% (target: varies)
Audit status:     pending review
```

## STEP 1: PLAN VERIFICATION

Cross-check content against the plan file:

1. **Outline compliance**: Is every section from `content_outline` present as an H2/H3?
2. **Vocabulary scope**: List every Ukrainian vocabulary word taught in the content. Compare against `vocabulary_hints.required` in the plan. Flag any word NOT in the plan.
3. **Grammar scope**: What grammar does this module teach? What grammar from LATER modules appears in examples or dialogues? (This is scope creep — flag it.)
4. **Objectives**: Are all learning objectives from the plan addressed in the content?

Report findings as:
```
Plan-Content Alignment: [PASS/FAIL]
- Sections: [all present / missing: X, Y]
- Vocabulary: [X/Y from plan used, Z extra words found]
- Grammar scope: [clean / scope creep: specific items]
- Objectives: [all covered / missing: X]
```

---

## STEP 2: DEEP VERIFICATION (Line by Line)

### Ukrainian Sentences
Go through the file section by section. For EACH Ukrainian sentence:
- Is grammar correct? (cases, verb forms, agreement)
- Does it sound natural? (not robotic, not calqued from English)
- Are there Russianisms? (check against list below)
- Is vocabulary appropriate for the level?

### English Sentences
- Is it clear and accessible?
- Warm tutor voice or cold textbook?
- Over-explaining simple things? Under-explaining complex ones?

### IPA Transcriptions (if present)
- Every transcription must be checked for correct stress placement
- Ukrainian stress is unpredictable — verify each one
- Watch for English approximations instead of Ukrainian phonemes

### Activities (EVERY ITEM)

**CRITICAL: Read the actual YAML file line by line.** Do NOT assume what the file contains — read it. If a previous review said "add English cues" but the file already has them, acknowledge the fix is present. Never cite an issue that doesn't exist in the CURRENT file.

Check each activity item individually:
- **quiz**: Grammatically correct? Exactly one correct answer? Options plausible?
- **fill-in**: Sentence correct with answer filled in? Only ONE valid answer given the context/cues? Distractors plausible?
- **match-up**: All pairs correct? No duplicates?
- **true-false**: True statements actually true? False clearly false?
- **unjumble**: Answer forms a correct, natural sentence?
- **group-sort**: Items correctly categorized?
- **anagram**: Solution correct? Hint clear?

Count as you go. You MUST report how many items you checked.

**Verification rule**: For EVERY issue you cite, quote the EXACT line from the file. If you cannot quote it, the issue does not exist.

---

## STEP 3: AUTO-FAIL CHECKLIST

Check EVERY category. Report "[CLEAN]" or list specific findings.

### Russianisms
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| кушать | їсти |
| приймати участь | брати участь |
| самий кращий | найкращий |
| слідуючий | наступний |
| на протязі | протягом |
| любий (any) | будь-який |
| отвічати | відповідати |
| вообще | взагалі |
| получати | отримувати |
| відноситися | ставитися |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Calques
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| робити сенс | мати сенс |
| брати місце | відбуватися |
| це є | це (usually) |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Grammar Scope Violations
At module 1, students know ONLY modules 1-0. Any grammar from later modules is scope creep.
- Past tense (if not yet taught)
- Cases not yet introduced
- Verb forms not yet taught

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list specific violations with line numbers]

### Activity Errors
- Wrong answer marked as correct
- Multiple valid answers but only one accepted
- Grammatically incorrect sentences
- Duplicate items

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with activity number and item number]

### Beginner Safety ("Would I Continue?" Test)
| Question | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Did I feel overwhelmed? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Were instructions clear? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Did I get quick wins? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Was Ukrainian scary? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Would I come back tomorrow? | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Total** | **X/5** |

Emotional beats found:
- Welcome/orientation: [yes/no, where]
- Curiosity trigger: [yes/no, where]
- Quick wins: [count, where]
- Encouragement: [count, where]
- Progress marker: [yes/no, where]

---

## STEP 4: SCORE DIMENSIONS

**Score ONLY after completing Steps 1-3.** Each score must link to specific findings.

### Scoring Rules
- **9-10**: Excellent — no issues found in this dimension
- **7-8**: Good — minor issues found
- **5-6**: Needs work — multiple issues
- **<5**: Serious problems — major rewrite needed
- **If you found 3 grammar errors, Language cannot be 9**
- **If scope creep found, Relevance and Pedagogy cannot be 8+**

### Auto-Fail Thresholds
| Dimension | Auto-fail if below |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Experience Quality | <7 |
| Coherence | <7 |
| Relevance | <7 |
| Educational | <7 |
| Language | <8 |
| Pedagogy | <7 |
| Immersion | <6 |
| Activities | <7 |
| Richness | <6 |
| Beginner Safety | <7 |
| LLM Fingerprint | <7 |
| Linguistic Accuracy | <9 |

### Weighted Overall Score
```
Overall = (Experience × 1.5 + Coherence × 1.0 + Relevance × 1.0 + Educational × 1.2 +
          Language × 1.1 + Pedagogy × 1.2 + Immersion × 1.0 + Activities × 1.3 +
          Richness × 0.9 + Beginner_Safety × 1.3 + LLM × 1.0 + Linguistic_Accuracy × 1.5) / 14.0
```

**Quality target: 9.0+ overall AND no dimension below its auto-fail threshold.**
**If the score is below 9.0, you MUST provide a Fix Plan (see output format) with specific actions to reach 9/10.** The fix plan drives the iteration loop — Claude will send fixes to Gemini until the module reaches 9.0+.

## Boundaries

- Do NOT modify any files OTHER than the output file
- Do NOT score generously — honesty prevents bad curriculum
- Do NOT skip any step or dimension
- Do NOT fabricate issues — every critique must cite a specific line number
- Do NOT give vague feedback like "could be improved" — say exactly what and where
