1. **Content** (the lesson you're reviewing): `# The Locative: Where Things Are

## Warm-up

Imagine you are in the heart of Kyiv, standing on the famous **Майдан Незалежності** (Independence Square). You are looking for a specific place. You might ask: «Де магазин?» (Where is the store?) or «Де метро?» (Where is the metro?). To answer these questions, you need more than just names of places; you need to describe *where* things are located.

In this module, you will learn the **Locative case** — the case used to talk about location. Whether you are describing what's in your room, where you work, or how to find a street in a new city, the locative case is your essential tool for navigation.

Ukrainian spaces are filled with character. From the quiet corners of a **парк** (park) to the busy platforms of a **вокзал** (station), knowing how to place yourself in these locations will make you feel at home in Ukraine.

> [!history-bite]
> Did you know that the most common street name in Ukraine is **вулиця Шевченка** (Shevchenko Street)? It is named after Taras Shevchenko, the national poet. Almost every city, town, and even small village in Ukraine has a street dedicated to him. So, if you are lost and looking for "Shevchenka Street," you'll likely find one nearby!

## Presentation

### The Question «Де?» (Where?)

To ask about location, we use the word **де**. 

- **Де** школа? (Where is the school?)
- **Де** Андрій? (Where is Andriy?)

To answer, we use prepositions like **в/у** (in) or **на** (on/at), followed by the noun in the **Locative case**.

### Locative Case Endings (Singular)

For most nouns in the singular, the locative ending is **-і**.

| Gender | Nominative (Who/What) | Locative (Where) | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Masculine** | стіл (table) | на стол**і** | Книга на столі. |
| **Feminine** | школа (school) | у шкіл**і** | Діти у школі. |
| **Neuter** | вікно (window) | на вікн**і** | Кіт на вікні. |

**Important Note on Soft Nouns:**
If a noun ends in **-я** or **-ій**, the ending changes to **-ї**.
- Марі**я** → при Марі**ї**
- армі**я** → в армі**ї**

### Consonant Changes (The "Secret" Shifts)

Ukrainian has a beautiful but sometimes tricky feature: when we add the **-і** ending, certain consonants at the end of the stem change to sound softer. This is a historical process that reflects how the language has evolved to be more fluid in its pronunciation.

- **к → ц**: пар**к** → у пар**ц**і, бібліоте**к**а → у бібліоте**ц**і, апте**к**а → в апте**ц**і.
- **г → з**: доро**г**а → на доро**з**і, но**г**а → на нозі, подру**г**а → при подрузі.
- **х → с**: ву**х**о → у ву**с**і, му**х**а → на мусі.

Don't worry about memorizing these all at once! You will mostly encounter the **к → ц** change in words like *парк* or *аптека*. Think of it as the "softening" of the hard consonant to meet the high vowel **-і**. It’s one of the things that makes Ukrainian sound like music!

### Vowel Alternation: The "Disappearing" and "Changing" Letters

Another fascinating feature you'll encounter is vowel alternation. Sometimes, when a noun changes its ending, the vowel inside the stem changes too. This most commonly happens with the letter **-і-** changing to **-о-** or **-е-**.

- **стіл** (table) → на ст**о**лі
- **кіт** (cat) → на к**о**ті
- **Київ** (Kyiv) → у Ки**є**ві
- **Львів** (Lviv) → у Льв**о**ві

Why does this happen? Traditionally, in Ukrainian, the vowel **-і-** often appears in "closed" syllables (syllables ending in a consonant). When we add an ending like **-і**, the syllable becomes "open," and the original vowel (**о** or **е**) returns. It's like a linguistic memory! When you see **стіл**, remember that its "location form" will bring back the **о** to become **столі**.

### Prepositions: «В / У» vs. «На» — The Deep Logic

Choosing between **в/у** and **на** can be a bit like a cultural puzzle. While in English we often use "at" or "in" somewhat interchangeably, Ukrainian has a more grounded logic.

1. **В / У (In)**: Generally used for enclosed spaces, containers, or locations with clearly defined physical or administrative boundaries.
   - **у** магазині (in the store) — you are inside the building.
   - **в** офісі (in the office) — you are within the four walls.
   - **у** кімнаті (in the room).
   - **у** місті (in the city) — you are within the city limits.

2. **На (On / At)**: This is used for several distinct categories that are worth remembering:
   - **Surfaces**: **на** столі (on the table), **на** підлозі (on the floor), **на** стіні (on the wall).
   - **Open Spaces**: **на** вулиці (on the street), **на** площі (on the square), **на** стадіоні (at the stadium), **на** подвір'ї (in the yard).
   - **Events and Abstract Places**: **на** роботі (at work), **на** уроці (at the lesson), **на** концерті (at the concert), **на** війні (at war).
   - **Public Institutions of Transport/Communication**: **на** вокзалі (at the station), **на** пошті (at the post office), **на** зупинці (at the bus stop).

> [!tip]
> A common point of confusion for English speakers: In Ukrainian, you are always **на роботі** (at work), never "в роботі." Similarly, you are **на пошті** (at the post office) and **на вокзалі** (at the train station). Think of these as locations where you are "out" in the public sphere, engaged in an activity or waiting for a service. If you say "я в роботі," a Ukrainian might think you are physically inside a machine or completely buried in a pile of tasks!

### The Euphony Rule: В vs. У — Making it Flow

To keep the language sounding melodic (euphony), Ukrainian chooses **в** or **у** based on the surrounding sounds. This is not a strict grammar rule that changes the meaning, but it is essential for sounding like a native speaker.

- Use **у** if the previous word ends in a consonant and the next word starts with a consonant: *Він працює **у** школі.* (Consonant 'є' is treated as a vowel sound /je/, so let's look closer: *Степан **у** школі* — consonant 'н' + 'у' + 'ш' = smooth).
- Use **в** if the previous word ends in a vowel: *Вона **в** офісі.* (Vowel 'а' + 'в' + 'о' = smooth).
- If the word starts with **в** or **ф**, we almost always use **у** to avoid a "stutter" effect: *Я **у** Вінниці* (not *я в Вінниці*).

## Practice

Тепер практика! (Now practice!) Let's see how these rules work in everyday situations.

### Запитання та відповіді (Asking and Answering)

In Ukrainian, we often omit the verb "is" in the present tense. This makes your sentences short and punchy!

- **Де тато?** — Він **на роботі**. (Where is dad? — He is at work.)
- **Де документи?** — Вони **в банку**. (Where are the documents? — They are in the bank.)
- **Де Світлана?** — Вона **на вулиці** Шевченка. (Where is Svitlana? — She is on Shevchenko Street.)
- **Де вокзал?** — Він **на площі**. (Where is the station? — It is on the square.)

> [!tip]
> Місцевий відмінок — це ваш ключ до навігації! Ви знаєте «де» — і знайдете все у місті.

### Transformation Practice

Try to transform these nouns from the Nominative (Base) form to the Locative (Location) form. Focus on the ending and any vowel/consonant shifts:

1. **Дім** (Home) → **у домі** (Standard ending -і).
2. **Школа** (School) → **у школі** (Standard ending -і).
3. **Парк** (Park) → **у парку** (Wait! Some masculine nouns take **-у** instead of **-і**. This is very common for short words and names of places like *парк*, *сад*, *ліс*. While **у парці** is grammatically possible based on the general rule, **у парку** is the most natural way to say it in modern Ukrainian.)
4. **Магазин** (Store) → **у магазині** (Simple addition of -і).
5. **Стіл** (Table) → **на столі** (Notice the vowel shift: і → о!).
6. **Бібліотека** (Library) → **у бібліотеці** (Notice the consonant shift: к → ц!).

### Situational Dialogues

**Діалог А: Де ти?**
- Оксано, де ти? (Oksana, where are you?)
- Я **в кафе**. А де ти? (I am in the cafe. And where are you?)
- Я **на зупинці**. Чекаю автобус. (I am at the bus stop. Waiting for the bus.)
- Добре, я вже їду! (OK, I'm on my way!)

**Діалог Б: Де мої речі?**
- Де мій телефон? (Where is my phone?)
- Він **на столі**, у кімнаті. (It is on the table, in the room.)
- А де ключі? (And where are the keys?)
- Вони **в сумці**, на полиці. (They are in the bag, on the shelf.)
- Дякую! А де паспорт? (Thanks! And where is the passport?)
- **У шухляді**, на столі. (In the drawer, on the desk.)

**Діалог В: У місті**
- Перепрошую, де аптека? (Excuse me, where is the pharmacy?)
- Аптека **на вулиці** Шевченка. (The pharmacy is on Shevchenko Street.)
- А банк? (And the bank?)
- Банк **на площі**, біля пошти. (The bank is on the square, near the post office.)
- Дякую! (Thank you!)

### Vocabulary Expansion: The Street and the City

Let's add some more essential locations to your mental map. Remember to apply the correct preposition!

- **У парку** (In the park) — *Quiet and green.*
- **На стадіоні** (At the stadium) — *Loud and active.*
- **В університеті** (At the university) — *Academic and busy.*
- **На пошті** (At the post office) — *For your parcels.*
- **У лікарні** (In the hospital) — *For health.*
- **На вокзалі** (At the train station) — *For travels.*

### Cultural Context: The Center of the City

In most Ukrainian cities, the life happens **на Майдані** (on the Square) or **на центральній вулиці** (on the main street). When you are meeting someone, you might say: "Зустрінемося **у центрі**" (Let's meet in the center). Note that **центр** takes **у** because it is seen as a defined area or district.

> [!note]
> You might notice that some words change their internal vowels too. For example, **стіл** becomes **столі** (the 'і' changes to 'о'). This is another beautiful shift in Ukrainian phonetics called "vowel alternation." It often happens when a syllable goes from being "closed" (ending in a consonant) to "open" (ending in a vowel). It's a rhythm thing — the language prefers the fuller 'o' or 'e' when the syllable has space to breathe!


### На вокзалі (At the Station)

Уявіть: ви на вокзалі. Що ви чуєте? (Imagine: you are at the station. What do you hear?)

- Поїзд **на платформі**. (The train is at the platform.)
- Каса **у вокзалі**. (The ticket office is in the station building.)
- Кафе **на другому поверсі**. (The cafe is on the second floor.)
- Автобус **на зупинці**. (The bus is at the stop.)

> [!tip]
> Зверніть увагу: ви **на** вокзалі (at the station), але каса **у** вокзалі (inside the building). Різні ситуації — різні прийменники!

## Production

> [!challenge]
> Спробуйте описати свою кімнату українською! Використовуйте «на» і «в/у» з місцевим відмінком. Наприклад: «Книга на столі. Кіт на ліжку.»

### Describing Your Space

Опишіть свою кімнату! (Describe your room!) Where are your things? Can you name them and their locations?

- Мій комп'ютер **на столі**. (My computer is on the table.)
- Моя ручка **у сумці**. (My pen is in the bag.)
- Картина **на стіні**. (The picture is on the wall.)
- Мій телефон **на ліжку**. (My phone is on the bed.)

Now, imagine you are in a Ukrainian city. You are standing on a big **площа** (square). What do you see?

- **У парку** є дерева. (There are trees in the park.)
- **На вулиці** є машини. (There are cars on the street.)
- **В аптеці** є ліки. (There is medicine in the pharmacy.)

### Взаємодія: «Де ти?» (Where are you?)

Друг телефонує і питає: «Де ти?» Як відповісти? (A friend calls and asks: "Where are you?" How do you answer?)

- Я **вдома**. (I am at home — a special adverb!)
- Я **в університеті**. (I am at the university.)
- Я **на пошті**. (I am at the post office.)
- Я **у парку**. (I am in the park.)

Місцевий відмінок — як світло в темній кімнаті. Раптом усе має своє місце! Практикуйте ці закінчення кожного дня. Скоро ви зможете описати весь світ українською!

# Summary

У цьому модулі ви вивчили **місцевий відмінок** (the Locative case) — the case that tells us *where* something or someone is located.

**Key points to remember:**

- Ask about location with **Де?** (Where?)
- Most nouns take the ending **-і** in the locative singular
- Nouns ending in **-я** or **-ій** take **-ї** (Марія → при Марії)
- Consonants shift before **-і**: **к → ц** (парк → у парці), **г → з** (дорога → на дорозі), **х → с** (вухо → у вусі)
- Vowel alternation: **і → о/е** in open syllables (стіл → на столі, Київ → у Києві)
- **В/У** = inside, enclosed spaces (у магазині, в офісі)
- **На** = surfaces, open spaces, events, public institutions (на столі, на вулиці, на роботі)
- Euphony: choose **в** after vowels, **у** after consonants

6. **Research notes** (if exists): `# Research: A1 M13 — The Locative: Where Things Are

## 1. Grammar: State Standard 2024 Reference

The Locative case corresponds to the **Початковий рівень (А1)** requirements in the *Державний стандарт української мови як іноземної (2024)*.

**Section: § 4.2.3.3. Місцевий відмінок**
> "у, в, на (позначення місця): Спортивний костюм у великій сумці. Студент працює в новій лабораторії. Гроші лежать на столі;
> у, в (позначення моменту часу (коли?) в поєднанні зі словами – назвами місяців): Марія народилася у травні."

*Note: While the standard mentions time expressions (months), at the A1.M13 stage, the focus is strictly on spatial location.*

## 2. Vocabulary Frequency

Key vocabulary for this topic focuses on high-frequency nouns related to the immediate environment and city navigation.

| Word (Nominative) | English | Frequency/Level Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Стіл** | Table | High frequency; requires vowel alternation (*столі*). |
| **Школа** | School | Essential A1 noun. |
| **Місто** | City | High frequency for "in the city" (*у місті*). |
| **Парк** | Park | Very high frequency; involves consonant mutation (*парку/парці*). |
| **Магазин** | Store | Essential for daily survival scenarios. |
| **Робота** | Work | Essential for personal descriptions. |
| **Київ** | Kyiv | Most common city proper noun in examples. |
| **Вулиця** | Street | Essential for addresses. |
| **Кімната** | Room | Essential for describing home/office. |
| **Кафе** | Cafe | High frequency; non-declining loanword example. |

**Common Collocations:**
- **в університеті** (at the university)
- **на роботі** (at work)
- **у центрі** (in the center)
- **на вулиці** (on the street / outside)

## 3. Cultural Hook

**1. The "Shevchenko" Toponymy:**
A verified cultural phenomenon in Ukraine is the ubiquity of Taras Shevchenko's name in public spaces. As of recent statistics, there are over **1,200 streets** named after the national poet Taras Shevchenko in Ukraine. It is the most common street name in the country, followed by *Lesya Ukrainka* and *Ivan Franko*. For a student learning the Locative case, asking for "вулиця Шевченка" is a practical and culturally resonant exercise.

**2. "В Україні" (In Ukraine):**
The choice of preposition with the word "Ukraine" is a significant cultural and political marker. Historically, Russian influence promoted "на Україні" (as if it were a territory or borderland). Modern Ukrainian strictly uses **«в Україні»**, asserting the country's status as a sovereign, independent state. This is a vital "Myth Buster" and cultural point for learners to grasp early.

## 4. Pedagogical Notes

**Key Differences from English:**
- **Preposition Mandatory:** Unlike some English constructions (e.g., "Home" vs "At home"), the Locative case in Ukrainian *always* requires a preposition (в/у or на).
- **Surface vs. Enclosed:** English uses "in" for both "in the park" and "in the store," but Ukrainian distinguishes between enclosed spaces (**в**) and open surfaces or events (**на**).
- **Consonant/Vowel Shifts:** Unlike the Accusative case, the Locative triggers internal stem changes (o -> i alternation and k -> ts mutations) which can be intimidating for beginners.

**Common Learner Errors:**
- **Confusion with Accusative:** Using Locative for motion (e.g., *Я йду в парку* instead of *в парк*).
- **Omission of Endings:** Sticking to the Nominative form after a preposition.
- **Incorrect Mutation:** Forgetting the *k -> ts* shift (e.g., *в парку* vs *в парці*). *Note: Standard Ukrainian allows "у парку" as a variant, but "у бібліотеці" is strict.*

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Introduce **Де?** (Where?) with the basic **-і** ending.
2. Introduce the **в/у** vs. **на** logic.
3. Introduce common soft-noun endings (**-ї**).
4. Introduce the most common consonant shifts (**к → ц**) as "sound softening."

## 5. Scope Boundaries

**IN SCOPE:**
- **Singular Nouns:** Masculine, Feminine, and Neuter.
- **Prepositions:** **в/у** and **на** (spatial location only).
- **Ending -і:** The primary Locative ending for most nouns.
- **Basic Mutations:** **к → ц** (e.g., парк -> парці) and **о → і** alternation (стіл -> столі).
- **Soft Nouns:** Feminine nouns ending in **-я** (e.g., Марія -> Марії).

**OUT OF SCOPE:**
- **Plural Locative:** (e.g., *в університетах*). This is usually deferred to A2.
- **Adjectives in Locative:** (e.g., *у великій кімнаті*). Focus remains on "Noun-only" or "Possessive + Noun" if already learned.
- **Pronouns in Locative:** (e.g., *на мені*, *у ньому*). 
- **Complex Consonant Shifts:** **г → з** and **х → с** should be introduced sparingly as they are less frequent at A1.
- **Time/Months:** Even though the Standard lists them, using Locative for months is typically saved for A2 or a later A1 module on Time.
- **Motion (Accusative):** Contrast with Accusative should be mentioned to prevent errors, but the focus is on static location.

**Do not proceed until you have read every line of the content and every activity item.**

> **ANTI-STALE-REVIEW RULE**: This file may have been fixed since a previous review. You MUST review the CURRENT state of the files, not repeat findings from a prior review. If an issue was cited before but is now fixed, it must NOT appear in your review. Every finding must be verifiable by quoting the actual current content.

## STEP 1: PLAN VERIFICATION

Cross-check content against the plan file:

1. **Outline compliance**: Is every section from `content_outline` present as an H2/H3?
2. **Vocabulary scope**: List every Ukrainian vocabulary word taught in the content. Compare against `vocabulary_hints.required` in the plan. Flag any word NOT in the plan.
3. **Grammar scope**: What grammar does this module teach? What grammar from LATER modules appears in examples or dialogues? (This is scope creep — flag it.)
4. **Objectives**: Are all learning objectives from the plan addressed in the content?

Report findings as:
```
Plan-Content Alignment: [PASS/FAIL]
- Sections: [all present / missing: X, Y]
- Vocabulary: [X/Y from plan used, Z extra words found]
- Grammar scope: [clean / scope creep: specific items]
- Objectives: [all covered / missing: X]
```

---

## STEP 2: DEEP VERIFICATION (Line by Line)

### Ukrainian Sentences
Go through the file section by section. For EACH Ukrainian sentence:
- Is grammar correct? (cases, verb forms, agreement)
- Does it sound natural? (not robotic, not calqued from English)
- Are there Russianisms? (check against list below)
- Is vocabulary appropriate for the level?

### English Sentences
- Is it clear and accessible?
- Warm tutor voice or cold textbook?
- Over-explaining simple things? Under-explaining complex ones?

### IPA Transcriptions (if present)
- Every transcription must be checked for correct stress placement
- Ukrainian stress is unpredictable — verify each one
- Watch for English approximations instead of Ukrainian phonemes

### Activities (EVERY ITEM)

**CRITICAL: Read the actual YAML file line by line.** Do NOT assume what the file contains — read it. If a previous review said "add English cues" but the file already has them, acknowledge the fix is present. Never cite an issue that doesn't exist in the CURRENT file.

Check each activity item individually:
- **quiz**: Grammatically correct? Exactly one correct answer? Options plausible?
- **fill-in**: Sentence correct with answer filled in? Only ONE valid answer given the context/cues? Distractors plausible?
- **match-up**: All pairs correct? No duplicates?
- **true-false**: True statements actually true? False clearly false?
- **unjumble**: Answer forms a correct, natural sentence?
- **group-sort**: Items correctly categorized?
- **anagram**: Solution correct? Hint clear?

Count as you go. You MUST report how many items you checked.

**Verification rule**: For EVERY issue you cite, quote the EXACT line from the file. If you cannot quote it, the issue does not exist.

---

## STEP 3: AUTO-FAIL CHECKLIST

Check EVERY category. Report "[CLEAN]" or list specific findings.

### Russianisms
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| кушать | їсти |
| приймати участь | брати участь |
| самий кращий | найкращий |
| слідуючий | наступний |
| на протязі | протягом |
| любий (any) | будь-який |
| отвічати | відповідати |
| вообще | взагалі |
| получати | отримувати |
| відноситися | ставитися |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Calques
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| робити сенс | мати сенс |
| брати місце | відбуватися |
| це є | це (usually) |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Grammar Scope Violations
At module 13, students know ONLY modules 1-12. Any grammar from later modules is scope creep.
- Past tense (if not yet taught)
- Cases not yet introduced
- Verb forms not yet taught

## STEP 4: SCORE DIMENSIONS

**Score ONLY after completing Steps 1-3.** Each score must link to specific findings.

### Scoring Rules
- **9-10**: Excellent — no issues found in this dimension
- **7-8**: Good — minor issues found
- **5-6**: Needs work — multiple issues
- **<5**: Serious problems — major rewrite needed
- **If you found 3 grammar errors, Language cannot be 9**
- **If scope creep found, Relevance and Pedagogy cannot be 8+**

### Auto-Fail Thresholds
| Dimension | Auto-fail if below |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Experience Quality | <7 |
| Coherence | <7 |
| Relevance | <7 |
| Educational | <7 |
| Language | <8 |
| Pedagogy | <7 |
| Immersion | <6 |
| Activities | <7 |
| Richness | <6 |
| Beginner Safety | <7 |
| LLM Fingerprint | <7 |
| Linguistic Accuracy | <9 |

### Weighted Overall Score
```
Overall = (Experience × 1.5 + Coherence × 1.0 + Relevance × 1.0 + Educational × 1.2 +
          Language × 1.1 + Pedagogy × 1.2 + Immersion × 1.0 + Activities × 1.3 +
          Richness × 0.9 + Beginner_Safety × 1.3 + LLM × 1.0 + Linguistic_Accuracy × 1.5) / 14.0
```

**Quality target: 9.0+ overall AND no dimension below its auto-fail threshold.**
**If the score is below 9.0, you MUST provide a Fix Plan (see output format) with specific actions to reach 9/10.** The fix plan drives the iteration loop — Claude will send fixes to Gemini until the module reaches 9.0+.

## Strengths
- [Specific strength with evidence from content]

## Fix Plan to Reach 9/10 (REQUIRED if score < 9.0)

For EACH dimension scoring below 9, provide a concrete action plan:

### {Dimension Name}: {current}/10 → 9/10

**What to fix:**
1. Line {N}: Change "{current text}" → "{replacement text}" — {why this raises the score}
2. Section "{name}": {specific action} — {expected impact}
3. ...

**Expected score after fix:** {X}/10

[Repeat for every dimension below 9. Be specific — line numbers, exact replacements, section names.]

### Projected Overall After Fixes

## Boundaries

- Do NOT modify any files OTHER than the output file
- Do NOT score generously — honesty prevents bad curriculum
- Do NOT skip any step or dimension
- Do NOT fabricate issues — every critique must cite a specific line number
- Do NOT give vague feedback like "could be improved" — say exactly what and where
