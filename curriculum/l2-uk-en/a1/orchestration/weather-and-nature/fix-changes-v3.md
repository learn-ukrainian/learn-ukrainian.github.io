## Applied Fixes

1. [File: content] No changes needed (matched Fix Plan).
2. [File: activities] No changes needed (matched Fix Plan).
3. [File: vocabulary] Added: вітер, сонце, хмара — Synced vocabulary with activities (Activity Issue 1 & 2 compliance).
4. [File: vocabulary] Fixed IPA: вітряно, природа, сонячно — Corrected stress/transcription.

## Fixes NOT Applied (explain why)

- Activity Fixes 1-4 (Remove Untaught Words, Fix Quiz Scenarios, Fix Grammar): The input files already contained these fixes (e.g., `мороз` was already gone, quiz options were already updated). I outputted the correct, fixed state.
- Snow description "white water": The target phrase "Падає біла вода" was not found in the input files (already fixed to "йде сніг" in `fill-in` activity), so no replacement was needed.
