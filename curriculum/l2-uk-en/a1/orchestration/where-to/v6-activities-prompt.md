# V6 Activity Generation — Structured YAML for Inline + Workbook Exercises

You are generating structured exercise YAML for a Ukrainian language module. The exercises will be injected into the lesson tab (inline) and workbook tab (workbook) of the module.

## Your Task

Generate an `activities/where-to.yaml` file for module **31: Where To?** (a1).

**CRITICAL: Output ONLY raw YAML.** Your very first character must be `version:`. No markdown, no commentary, no explanation, no file paths, no "Here is the YAML", no code fences. Just the YAML document starting with `version: "1.0"`. ANY text before `version:` will cause a parse failure.

## ⚠️ HARD COUNT TARGETS — READ TWICE

These are the binding numerical contracts for THIS module. The audit will FAIL if you fall short.

| Bucket | Min | Max | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total activities | 10 | 10+ | inline + workbook combined |
| Inline (lesson tab) | 4 | 6 | one per `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY -->` marker, see below |
| Workbook (Зошит tab) | 6 | 9 | extended practice |
| Items per activity | 6 | — | each activity must have at least 6 items (unless its type cap is lower — see Activity Type Reference below) |

**You MUST ship at least 4 inline activities AND at least 6 workbook activities.** Going under either is a hard failure — the audit gate enforces it and the build will reject your output.

**Type diversity is required.** The module (inline + workbook combined) MUST use at least **0** distinct activity types — do NOT ship a wall of the same type. As a quality target, quiz + true-false combined should be NO MORE than ~25% of the workbook (i.e. lean on the priority types below, not on easy multiple-choice). Use the `WORKBOOK_PRIORITY_TYPES` list below; those carry the most weight at this level. (If `0` is `0`, the audit profile for this level does not enforce type diversity — but variety still produces a better lesson, so aim for 4+ types when the workbook allows it.)

---

## Allowed types for THIS level

- **Inline (lesson) types:** image-to-letter, letter-grid, match-up, watch-and-repeat, quiz, true-false, fill-in, classify
- **Inline priority (preferred):** image-to-letter, match-up, fill-in, quiz, watch-and-repeat
- **Workbook types:** fill-in, match-up, group-sort, anagram, unjumble, quiz, true-false, classify, divide-words, count-syllables, pick-syllables, observe, phrase-table, odd-one-out
- **Workbook priority (preferred):** fill-in, match-up, group-sort, anagram, unjumble
- **FORBIDDEN at this level:** cloze, error-correction, mark-the-words, translate, essay-response, critical-analysis, reading, comparative-study, authorial-intent, etymology-trace, translation-critique, source-evaluation, debate, paleography-analysis, dialect-comparison, transcription, highlight-morphemes, grammar-identify, select

Pick from the allowed list. Lean heavily on the priority lists. Do not use any forbidden type — the build will reject it.

---

## Inline vs Workbook Split

Activities have two placement categories:

1. **inline** — short, focused exercises placed directly in the lesson (Урок tab) at specific injection points. The writer has placed `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: {id} -->` markers in the prose. Each inline activity MUST have an `id` that matches one of these markers.

2. **workbook** — extended practice exercises in the workbook (Зошит tab). These do NOT need ids.

**Rule of thumb:** inline = 4–6 quick checks after key teaching points. Workbook = 6–9 deeper practice exercises covering the full topic. **Every inline marker in the prose MUST have a matching inline activity** — that is what determines `INLINE_MIN`, so do NOT skip markers.

---

## Injection Markers in the Prose

The writer placed these markers in the module content. Your inline activities must match them:

- `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: fill-in-accusative -->`
- `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: quiz-de-or-kudy -->`
- `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: group-sort-de-kudy -->`
- `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: quiz-yty-or-ikhaty -->`

Each inline activity's `id` must match one of these markers exactly (lowercase, hyphenated).

---

## Plan Activity Hints

The plan specifies these exercises to create:

- focus: Де or Куди? Choose the right question for each sentence.
  items: 8
  type: quiz
- focus: 'Complete: Я йду ___ (школа). Він у ___ (банк).'
  items: 10
  type: fill-in
- focus: 'Sort phrases: Де? (locative) vs Куди? (accusative)'
  items: 10
  type: group-sort
- focus: Йти or їхати? Choose based on distance/transport.
  items: 6
  type: quiz


You MUST create activities that cover all these hints. Distribute them between inline and workbook as appropriate: focused checks go inline, extended practice goes to workbook.

---

## Plan Vocabulary

These words are the module's vocabulary foundation. ALL exercise items must use words from this list or from the prose:

recommended:
- магазин → у/в магазин (to the shop)
- бібліотека → у бібліотеку (to the library)
- ресторан → у ресторан (to the restaurant)
- Одеса → в Одесу (to Odesa)
- повертатися → додому (to return home)
required:
- куди (where to)
- йти (to go on foot)
- їхати (to go by transport)
- школа → у школу (to school)
- робота → на роботу (to work)
- банк → у банк (to the bank)


**Grounding rule:** Every Ukrainian word in your exercises must appear either in the prose content or in this vocabulary list. Do NOT invent new words the learner hasn't seen.

---

## Module Content (the prose the learner reads before exercises)

<module_content>
## Діалоги (Dialogues)

It is Saturday morning in the city. Oksana and Stepan are running errands together, but they have a long list of tasks to complete. They need to split up to visit different places around town efficiently. Listen as they coordinate their plans.

> **Оксана:** **Куди** (where to) ти йдеш? *(Where are you going?)*
> **Степан:** Я йду в банк. А ти? *(I am going to the bank. And you?)*
> **Оксана:** Я йду на роботу. *(I am going to work.)*
> **Степан:** А потім? *(And then?)*
> **Оксана:** Потім іду в магазин. *(Then I am going to the shop.)*
> **Степан:** А потім ходімо в кафе! *(And then let's go to a cafe!)*

This dialogue introduces a fundamental concept in Ukrainian grammar: the strict separation of direction and location. Notice that Stepan specifically says **я йду в банк** to express his direction of movement. He does not say **я в банку**, which would mean he is already inside the bank standing still. Ukrainian grammar forces you to choose between moving toward a destination and resting at a location.

> **Степан:** Куди ти їдеш у суботу? *(Where are you going on Saturday?)*
> **Оксана:** Я їду у Львів. *(I am going to Lviv.)*
> **Степан:** А Олена? *(And Olena?)*
> **Оксана:** Вона їде в Одесу. *(She is going to Odesa.)*
> **Степан:** А коли ви будете **повертатися** (to return) **додому** (home)? *(And when will you return home?)*
> **Оксана:** У неділю. *(On Sunday.)*

This second conversation focuses on cities as destinations. When traveling to a city, you must use the verb **їхати** (to go by transport) combined with the preposition **в** or **у** and the name of the city. Notice the subtle morphological change for Odesa: the nominative **Одеса** becomes the accusative **в Одесу** (to Odesa). However, Lviv experiences no change at all: **Львів** remains **у Львів**. This illustrates how the accusative case affects different types of nouns differently. 

:::note
**Cultural Note: Errands in Ukraine**
Many Ukrainians rely heavily on public transport or walking to complete their daily errands. Because of this, specifying the exact mode of transportation (**йти** vs **їхати**) is highly natural and common in everyday conversation.
:::

## Куди? Знахідний відмінок (Where To? Accusative)

In Ukrainian primary schools, Grade 4 students learn to identify cases using specific helper words and questions. For the accusative case (**Знахідний відмінок**), the mental helper phrase is **бачу** (I see), and the core questions are **кого?** (whom?) and **що?** (what?). This helps native speakers remember that the accusative case typically marks the direct object of an action. However, when dealing with geography and movement, the accusative case takes on an entirely new role. To express direction—specifically, physical motion toward a destination—we use the prepositions **в/у** or **на** followed directly by a noun in the accusative case. This grammatical structure perfectly answers the question **Куди?**.

We must explicitly contrast this directional use of the accusative with the static locative case (**Місцевий відмінок**). The formula **в/у** plus the locative case answers the question **Де?** (Where? = static position). English conflates these two concepts into a single interrogative word, but Ukrainian keeps them rigorously separated. Consider this clear comparison:
* **Де ти? — Я в банку.** (Locative — you ARE there, standing inside the building.)
* **Куди ти йдеш? — Я йду в банк.** (Accusative — you are GOING there, walking toward the building.)

There is excellent news for learners when forming these directional phrases: the "No-Change" rule applies to a massive portion of the Ukrainian vocabulary. Inanimate masculine nouns and all neuter nouns look completely identical to their basic nominative forms when used in the accusative case for direction. You do not need to memorize any new endings for these categories; simply take the dictionary form and add the correct preposition.
* **банк → у банк** (to the bank)
* **магазин → у/в магазин** (to the shop)
* **парк → у парк** (to the park)
* **кафе → у кафе** (to the cafe)
* **місто → у місто** (to the city)
* **ресторан → у ресторан** (to the restaurant)

:::tip
**Mnemonic: The "No-Change" Rule**
If a place name is masculine (ends in a consonant) or neuter (ends in **-о** or **-е**), its accusative form for direction is exactly the same as its dictionary form. You only need to worry about changing the ending if the word is feminine!
:::

The only noun category that demands a visible change in this directional context is feminine nouns. Feminine nouns that end in **-а** or **-я** shift their final vowel when answering the question **Куди?**. The ending **-а** consistently changes to **-у**, and the ending **-я** consistently changes to **-ю**. This is a highly visible, high-frequency grammatical signal that native speakers expect to hear in daily conversation.
* **школа → у школу** (to school)
* **робота → на роботу** (to work)
* **бібліотека → у бібліотеку** (to the library)
* **вулиця → на вулицю** (to the street)
* **Одеса → в Одесу** (to Odesa)

<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: fill-in-accusative -->

## Де чи куди? (Where or Where To?)

To navigate the Ukrainian language successfully, you must clearly map out the key question pair in your mind before speaking. If you want to know "Where are you?" in a static sense, you ask **Де ти?**, and this question absolutely requires an answer using **в**, **у**, or **на** plus the LOCATIVE case. If you want to know "Where are you going?" in a dynamic sense, you ask **Куди ти йдеш?**, and this requires an answer using **в**, **у**, or **на** plus the ACCUSATIVE case. The table below illustrates this crucial split.

| Place | Де? (М.в. - Static) | Куди? (Зн.в. - Dynamic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **школа** | **в школі** | **у школу** |
| **робота** | **на роботі** | **на роботу** |
| **банк** | **у банку** | **у банк** |
| **парк** | **у парку** | **у парк** |

Clear sentence examples highlight how to contrast the two cases in context. It is always the verb that dictates whether the situation is static or dynamic.
* **Лікар працює в лікарні.** (Де? — The doctor works in the hospital. The action of working is stationary.)
* **Я йду в лікарню.** (Куди? — I am going to the hospital. The action involves physical movement toward a specific target.)
* **Він сидить на роботі.** (Де? — He is sitting at work. The position is fixed.)
* **Вона їде на роботу.** (Куди? — She is driving to work. The position is actively changing.)
English merges these distinct realities into a single concept of "where," but Ukrainian strictly separates static location from dynamic direction. You must learn to hear the difference.

:::caution
**Common L2 Mistake: "Where" vs "Where To"**
English speakers often ask **Де ти йдеш?** when trying to say "Where are you going?". This is incorrect in Ukrainian because **Де** implies static location. You must ask **Куди ти йдеш?** to indicate movement toward a destination.
:::

<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: quiz-de-or-kudy -->
<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: group-sort-de-kudy -->

When discussing direction, you need the right verbs of motion. The two most vital verbs in Ukrainian are **йти** (to go on foot) and **їхати** (to go by transport). The choice between them depends entirely on how you are getting to your destination.
* **Я йду в магазин.** (I am walking to the local shop.)
* **Я їду на вокзал.** (I am taking transport to the train station.)
Both of these verbs express movement toward a target, so they both pair perfectly with **в** or **на** plus the accusative case to answer **Куди?**. You cannot use them interchangeably.

There is one special directional adverb that defies the usual preposition rules: **додому** (homeward or to home). This word inherently contains the concept of direction and requires no preposition at all. The phrase **повертатися додому** (to return home) is a fixed expression that naturally pairs a verb of motion with the directional adverb. We contrast it directly with the static location adverb **вдома** (at home).
* **Іван іде додому.** (Куди? — Ivan is walking home.)
* **Мама вдома.** (Де? — Mom is at home.)

<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: quiz-yty-or-ikhaty -->

## Підсумок — Summary

We can recap the fundamental difference between the two core questions and their associated cases. The question **Де?** triggers the Locative case (such as **в школі**, **на роботі**, or **у банку**) to express STATIC location. You use this when you are already physically present somewhere, sitting, standing, or working. Conversely, the question **Куди?** triggers the Accusative case (such as **у школу**, **на роботу**, or **у банк**) to express dynamic DIRECTION. You use this when you are in transit, walking, driving, or actively moving toward a specific destination. Mastering this distinction is essential for accurate communication in Ukrainian.

The rules for case endings for places in the Accusative case are remarkably straightforward. Masculine and neuter nouns experience absolutely no change; their nominative form is used exactly as is. For example, **банк** remains **у банк**, and **місто** remains **у місто**. Feminine nouns, however, shift their endings: the final **-а** changes to **-у**, and the final **-я** changes to **-ю**. Thus, **школа** becomes **у школу**, and **бібліотека** becomes **у бібліотеку**. The surrounding context and the specific verb of motion dictate the correct grammatical form you must select.

Before moving forward, review this self-check Q&A list to guarantee you have absorbed these vital distinctions.

* Q: Which question asks about static location?
* A: **Де?** (Where?)
* Q: Which question asks about the direction of movement?
* A: **Куди?** (Where to?)
* Q: How do you say "I am going to the bank"?
* A: **Я йду в банк.**
* Q: How do you say "I am at the bank"?
* A: **Я в банку.**
* Q: What happens to feminine place names answering "**Куди?**"
* A: They change their ending (for example, **школа → у школу**).
* Q: Which verb means "to go on foot"?
* A: **Йти.**
* Q: Which verb means "to go by transport"?
* A: **Їхати.**

## Topic-Specific Exercise Patterns (from Ukrainian pedagogy)

These patterns come from МійКлас and Ukrainian textbook analysis. They show what KINDS of exercises work best for this module's topic. Use them as templates — adapt the specific content to this module's vocabulary and concepts.

### Pattern: grammar-cases [§4.2.3.1, §4.2.3.2, §4.2.3.3]
**Відмінки іменників** (Noun cases)
- **fill-in** — Який відмінок?: Вставити іменник у правильній відмінковій формі / Fill in the correct case ending for a noun in context
  - Instruction: *Вставте іменник у правильній формі*
- **quiz** — Визнач відмінок: Визначити, у якому відмінку стоїть виділений іменник / Identify which case a highlighted noun is in
- **group-sort** — Розподіли за відмінками: Розподілити форми іменників за відмінками / Sort noun forms by their case
- **error-correction** — Знайди помилку у відмінку: Знайти неправильне відмінкове закінчення та виправити / Find wrong case ending and correct it
**Anti-patterns (DO NOT generate):**
- ❌ quiz-only: Учні мають ПРОДУКУВАТИ форми, а не тільки розпізнавати. Обов'язково fill-in
- ❌ translate: Англійська не має відмінків — переклад не тестує відмінювання

### Pattern: grammar-pronouns [§4.2.1.4, §4.2.2]
**Особові займенники** (Personal pronouns)
- **match-up** — Займенник → дієслово: Зіставити особовий займенник із правильною формою дієслова — зв'язок займенника з дієвідмінюванням / Match personal pronoun with correct verb form — linking pronouns to conjugation
  - Instruction: *З'єднайте займенник із дієсловом*
- **fill-in** — Вставте займенник: Обрати правильний займенник за контекстом речення / Choose the correct pronoun based on sentence context
  - Instruction: *Вставте правильний займенник*
- **group-sort** — Однина чи множина?: Розподілити займенники на однину та множину / Sort pronouns into singular and plural
  - Instruction: *Розподіліть*
- **quiz** — Ти чи Ви?: Обрати правильну форму звертання — неформальне (ти) чи ввічливе (Ви) / Choose correct address form — informal (ти) vs polite (Ви)
**Anti-patterns (DO NOT generate):**
- ❌ translate: Займенники — про зв'язок з дієсловом, а не переклад

### Pattern: general-reading [§1 (Speech activities — reading)]
**Розуміння тексту** (Reading comprehension)
- **true-false** — Правда чи ні?: Перевірити розуміння тексту або діалогу / Check comprehension of a passage or dialogue
- **quiz** — Відповідь на запитання: Відповісти на запитання за текстом / Answer questions about a text passage


**You MUST use these patterns.** The pedagogy patterns encode how Ukrainian teachers actually test each concept. For each matched pattern:
1. Generate **at least one activity of each recommended type** from the pattern. If the pattern lists divide-words, count-syllables, and odd-one-out — your output MUST include all three.
2. Follow the anti-patterns — if a type is listed under "DO NOT generate", do NOT use it for this topic.
3. Use the Ukrainian instruction (назва / instruction_uk) when the level allows Ukrainian instructions.

## Quality Rules

**ACTIVITY COUNT MINIMUMS (non-negotiable, audit-enforced):**
- **Total: 10 activities.** Inline: 4–6. Workbook: 6–9. The audit gate FAILS the module if you ship fewer.
- **Type diversity: workbook MUST cover ≥5 distinct activity types.** A wall of quizzes is rejected. Quiz + true-false combined ≤ 25% of workbook.
- **Match the inline markers exactly.** Every `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: id -->` marker in the prose needs a matching inline activity with that exact id. Skipping markers means the lesson tab is broken.

**ITEM COUNT MINIMUMS (non-negotiable, per-activity):**
- **Default minimum: 6 items per activity.** Quiz, fill-in, match-up, true-false, anagram, error-correction, translate, cloze, mark-the-words, divide-words, count-syllables, odd-one-out, group-sort categories: all ≥ 6.
- **Lower minimums for specific types only:** order = 3+ items (dialogue lines), observe = 2+ examples, pick-syllables = 4+ syllables, watch-and-repeat = 3+ items, essay-response/critical-analysis = 1 prompt.
- If you can't think of enough items, add more examples from the module's vocabulary and content. NEVER ship a 1-item or 2-item activity unless its type cap explicitly allows it.
- **Exactly 4 options per quiz question at A2+** — enough to prevent guessing, not so many to overwhelm. A1 allows 3-4.
- **BINARY CONCEPTS (e.g., НВ/ДВ, masculine/feminine, true/false):** Do NOT use `quiz` with only 2 options — use `true-false` (for statement evaluation) or `group-sort` (for categorization) instead. Quiz type requires 4 options at A2+.

**Instructions match learner level:**
1. **A1.1 (M01-M07):** Instructions in ENGLISH. The learner is a complete beginner who cannot read Ukrainian yet. They are learning the alphabet and first words. Use activity types: image-to-letter, letter-grid, match-up (letter↔sound), quiz (in English about Ukrainian sounds/letters). Anna Ohoiko's pronunciation videos should be referenced where relevant.
2. **A1.2-A1.3 (M08-M21):** Instructions in simple English with Ukrainian key terms in bold. Learner knows basic words but not grammar terminology.
3. **A1.4+ (M22-M55):** Instructions can be in simple Ukrainian with English translation in parentheses.
4. **A2+:** Instructions in Ukrainian.
5. **B1+:** Full Ukrainian, no English.

**Other rules:**
6. **No duplicate options** — each option in a quiz item must be unique
7. **Answer must be in options** — for quiz items, `correct` must be a valid index. For fill-in with options, `answer` must appear in `options`.
8. **Plausible distractors** — wrong options should be real Ukrainian words that test the specific skill. Not random words.
9. **Min 6 pairs for match-up** — to prevent trivial elimination
10. **Explanations for true-false and error-correction** — help the learner understand WHY
11. **Test LANGUAGE, not trivia** — exercises must test Ukrainian language skills. Not "In what year..." factual recall.

## Verification Tools (MCP)

Use these tools to verify your exercise content:

## Live Verification Tools (MCP)

You have access to RAG-powered MCP tools to verify Ukrainian language constructs **live as you write**. The research phase is already complete; use these tools strictly for targeted verification to ensure zero Russianisms, accurate grammar, and authentic usage.

**Core Tools:**
- `mcp_rag_verify_words` / `mcp_rag_verify_word` / `mcp_rag_verify_lemma` — VESUM morphological dictionary (409K lemmas, 6.7M forms). Returns full declension/conjugation.
- `mcp_rag_search_text` — Ukrainian school textbooks (Grades 1-11, 23K chunks).
- `mcp_rag_search_literary` — Primary literary sources (chronicles, poetry, legal texts).
- `mcp_rag_query_pravopys` — Official Ukrainian orthography rules (Правопис 2019).
- `mcp_rag_query_wikipedia` — Ukrainian Wikipedia.

**Dictionary Tools (NEW — use these for quality):**
- `mcp_rag_search_style_guide` — **Антоненко-Давидович (279 entries). HIGH PRIORITY.** Identifies calques and Russianisms. Use when unsure if a phrase is natural Ukrainian.
- `mcp_rag_query_cefr_level` — PULS CEFR vocabulary (5.9K words). Check if a word is level-appropriate (A1/A2/B1 etc.).
- `mcp_rag_search_definitions` — СУМ-11 (127K entries). Look up exact Ukrainian definitions.
- `mcp_rag_search_etymology` — Грінченко (67K entries). Historical forms, etymology.
- `mcp_rag_search_idioms` — Фразеологічний (25K entries). Find natural Ukrainian idioms.
- `mcp_rag_search_synonyms` — Ukrajinet WordNet (122K synsets). Synonyms, antonyms.
- `mcp_rag_translate_en_uk` — Балла EN→UK (79K entries). English→Ukrainian translations.
- `mcp_rag_query_grac` — GRAC corpus (2B tokens). Check word frequency, collocations, concordance. Use when unsure if a collocation is natural.
- `mcp_rag_query_ulif` — ULIF morphological paradigms. Full declension/conjugation tables. Use when verify_lemma isn't enough.
- `mcp_rag_query_r2u` — Russian→Ukrainian equivalents. Use when you suspect a word might be a Russicism — finds the proper Ukrainian alternative.

**WHEN to use tools (Specific Triggers):**

1. **Suspected Russianisms or Surzhyk (HIGH PRIORITY):**
   - *Trigger:* You are about to use a word that sounds similar to Russian, a calque, or you are unsure of its exact Ukrainian equivalent.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_search_style_guide` first (it knows calques). Then `mcp_rag_query_r2u` for the proper Ukrainian equivalent. Then verify with `mcp_rag_verify_words`.
   - *Example:* Checking *приймати участь* (calque) → *брати участь* (correct).

2. **Vocabulary Level Check:**
   - *Trigger:* You are writing for A1/A2 and want to ensure words are level-appropriate.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_query_cefr_level` to verify the word's CEFR level.

3. **Grammar & Morphology Doubts:**
   - *Trigger:* You are unsure about a case ending, irregular plural, or conjugation.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_verify_lemma` to pull the complete declension/conjugation.

4. **Natural Expressions:**
   - *Trigger:* You need a natural idiom or collocation for a dialogue.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_search_idioms` for Ukrainian expressions, `mcp_rag_search_synonyms` for word variety.

5. **Drafting Grammar Rules:**
   - *Trigger:* You are explaining a spelling or phonetic rule.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_query_pravopys` to confirm the exact 2019 standard.

6. **Checking Collocations & Frequency:**
   - *Trigger:* You want to confirm a word combination is actually used by native speakers.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_query_grac` with mode='collocations' to see real-world usage.

**MANDATORY Verification (these are NOT optional):**

7. **Letter/Sound Decomposition (ALWAYS VERIFY):**
   - *Trigger:* You are listing the letters, sounds, or syllables of ANY Ukrainian word.
   - *Action:* BEFORE writing the decomposition, call `mcp_rag_verify_word` on that word. The response shows the exact letter forms. Use ONLY what the tool returns. NEVER decompose a word from memory — your pre-training has wrong letter mappings (e.g., confusing и/і, я/а in specific words). This is the #1 source of errors.
   - *Example:* Before writing 'вулиця has letters В, У, Л...', call `mcp_rag_verify_word("вулиця")` and copy the letters from the result.

8. **Phonetic Claims (ALWAYS VERIFY):**
   - *Trigger:* You are stating how a letter sounds in a specific word, how many syllables a word has, or where stress falls.
   - *Action:* Call `mcp_rag_verify_word` to confirm. Ukrainian letters like є, ї, я, ю change sound value depending on position (after consonant vs word-initial). Do NOT guess — verify each claim.

9. **ANY Factual Claim About Ukrainian (VERIFY WHEN POSSIBLE):**
   - *Trigger:* You are stating a grammar rule, exception, or linguistic fact.
   - *Action:* Use `mcp_rag_query_pravopys` or `mcp_rag_search_text` to confirm. If you can't verify it, flag with `<!-- VERIFY: claim -->`.

**Efficiency Rules:**
- **Batch your checks:** Use `mcp_rag_verify_words` with 5-15 words at once.
- **Do NOT verify basic words:** *мама*, *стіл*, *робити* don't need checking.
- **Zero invention:** If VESUM doesn't know a word, don't use it.
- **Target: 10-20 tool calls per module** (was 8-15; mandatory checks added).

IMPORTANT: After using tools, output your COMPLETE module content as plain text. Do NOT narrate your tool usage. Just output the final module content.


**Verification checklist:**
1. Run `verify_words` on all Ukrainian words in your exercises — every word must exist in VESUM
2. Run `query_cefr_level` on any word you're unsure about — it must be a1-appropriate
3. For fill-in answers and distractors, verify the exact form (case, number, gender) with `verify_lemma`

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FINAL CHECKLIST — verify before emitting YAML

Walk through this checklist explicitly before you start emitting. If ANY box is unchecked, fix it FIRST.

- [ ] My output has **at least 4** inline activities (one per `<!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY -->` marker).
- [ ] My output has **at least 6** workbook activities.
- [ ] **Total ≥ 10.**
- [ ] **Every** activity has **at least 6** items, pairs, or statements (except types with explicitly lower caps: order=3, observe=2, pick-syllables=4, watch-and-repeat=3, essay-response=1).
- [ ] The module (inline + workbook combined) uses **at least 0 distinct activity types** (or 4+ when 0 = 0 and the workbook size allows it). I am NOT shipping a wall of quizzes.
- [ ] Quiz + true-false combined are roughly ≤25% of the workbook (quality target — lean on `WORKBOOK_PRIORITY_TYPES` instead).
- [ ] I prioritized types from `WORKBOOK_PRIORITY_TYPES` (heavy practice formats), not just easy-to-write quizzes.
- [ ] I used ZERO types from `FORBIDDEN_ACTIVITY_TYPES`.
- [ ] All fill-in items use `____` blanks, NOT `{word}` curly-brace syntax.
- [ ] My inline count is between 4 and 6. I did NOT create more injection markers than 6.
- [ ] Every Ukrainian word in my items appears in the prose or in `PLAN_VOCABULARY`.
- [ ] At B1+, all instructions are in Ukrainian (no English fallback).

If you cannot tick all of these, REGENERATE the activities BEFORE outputting. Shipping under-spec means the build rejects you and the heal loop has to redo your work — wasting compute.
