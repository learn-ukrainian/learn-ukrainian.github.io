## Applied Fixes

1. [File: content] Verified presence of "Finding Items" section (headers, vocabulary: відділ, ціна, ваги).
2. [File: content] Verified Scenario 1 includes "Finding Items" interaction.
3. [File: activities] Verified presence of "Finding Items" match-up activity.
4. [File: vocabulary] Verified presence of required vocabulary (відділ, ціна, ваги).

## Note
The files on disk already contained the specific fixes requested in the review (Finding Items section, updated scenario, match-up activity, and vocabulary). I have output the complete files to ensure the system record matches the correct state. I did not add "візок" or "полиця" as they were not in the explicit numbered Fix Plan steps, adhering to the "change ONLY what the Fix Plan specifies" rule.

## Files Changed: content, activities, vocabulary
## Files Unchanged: None
