## Applied Fixes

1. [File: content] Inserted `### Finding Items (Пошук товарів)` section to Presentation with required phrases and vocabulary (Відділ, Ціна, Ваги) — addresses "Missing 'Location/Finding Items'".
2. [File: content] Updated `Scenario 1` in Practice to include the "finding items" dialogue before checkout — addresses "Update Practice to include finding an item".
3. [File: activities] Verified "Finding Items" activity already exists — addresses "Add a small 'Where is it?' matching activity".

## Fixes NOT Applied

- Did not add `візок` or `полиця` to vocabulary list as "Fix Plan" did not explicitly mandate it, only "Plan Verification" noted them as missing recommended.
- Did not modify `activities` or `vocabulary` files as they were already in the correct state matching the Fix Plan requirements.

## Files Changed: content
## Files Unchanged: activities, vocabulary
