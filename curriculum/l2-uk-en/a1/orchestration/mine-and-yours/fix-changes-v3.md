## Applied Fixes

1. [File: activities] Activity "Choose the Correct Possessive", Item 8: Changed "Скажіть, чий це великий наш дім?" to "Скажіть, чий це великий ___ дім?" — Missing blank issue.

## Fixes NOT Applied (explain why)

- [File: content] IPA for `твій` (`/tʲvʲij/`) was already present in the file. No changes needed.
- [File: activities] "Possessive Sentence Order" questions were already fixed in the input file (e.g., "Whose is this house of ours?", "Whose things are these?").
- [File: activities] Vocabulary "їх" and names "Марка/Анни" were not present in the "Invariant vs Variable" activity group, so removal was not needed.
- [File: activities] "Свій vs Його/Її" item 7 was already "Вони знають ___ права", so no replacement was needed.
