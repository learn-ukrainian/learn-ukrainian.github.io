## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Grammar Trap (Dative Case)
- **Location**: Section "Type 3: The 'Lexicalized' Reflexive"
- **Original**: "- подобатися (podobatysia) — to be pleasing to/to like"
- **Problem**: This verb requires the Dative case (`Мені подобається`), which has not been taught. Listing it alongside standard Nominative verbs (`сміятися`, `вчитися`) implies it works the same way (`Я подобаюся` = "I am pleasing", NOT "I like"). This is a major beginner trap.
- **Fix**: Remove `подобатися` from the list entirely. It is not used in the activities or vocabulary list, so deletion is safe.

### Issue 2: Missing Explanation (3rd Person 'ть')
- **Location**: Section "The Two Shapes of the Postfix"
- **Original**: "When it ends in a consonant (like -ш or -ть), it stays as -ся (sia)."
- **Problem**: Students know Class I verbs end in vowels in 3rd person (`він знає`, `він читає`). They will be confused why `вмиватися` becomes `вмивається` (with a `ть`) instead of `вмиваєсь`. The text assumes the `ть` is already there.
- **Fix**: Add a small note: "Note: In the 3rd person, the historical 't' sound returns before the postfix (e.g., вмиває → вмивається)."

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test: 5/5
- Overwhelmed? [No]
- Instructions clear? [Yes]
- Quick wins? [Yes, simple rules]
- Ukrainian scary? [No, "soft buzz" makes it friendly]
- Come back tomorrow? [Yes]

Emotional beats: 4 found
- Welcome: "Imagine you are standing in front of a mirror."
- Curiosity: "The Secret Pronunciation: The 'Soft Buzz'"
- Quick wins: "In fact, you have already used a reflexive verb..."
- Encouragement: "It makes you sound much more like a native speaker!"

## Strengths
- **Phonetic Guidance**: The explanation of `[ц':а]` is critical and well-executed.
- **Analogy**: The "Grammatical Mirror" is a strong conceptual hook.
- **Activity Alignment**: The activities perfectly practice the exact rules taught (vowel vs consonant endings).

## Verdict

**PASS**

The module is excellent. The only necessary changes are removing the dangerous `подобатися` example to prevent Dative case confusion and clarifying the `ть` restoration in the 3rd person.
