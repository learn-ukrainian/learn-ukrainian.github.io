## Applied Fixes

(None - all requested fixes were verified as already present in the source files)

## Fixes NOT Applied (explain why)

- **Pedagogy / Unfair Testing**: The requested Class II conjugation table for `вчитися` (lines 79-91) and the explanatory note regarding `дивитися` and consonant mutation (lines 93-98) are **already present** in `09-reflexive-verbs.md`.
- **English Phrasing**: The text at line 22 already reads "What is this called?" (standard English), matching the requested fix.
- **Phantom Vocabulary**: The verbs `зупинятися` and `цілуватися` are **already present** in the "Three Types" lists in the Presentation section (lines 131 and 140), so they are properly introduced before being used in activities.
