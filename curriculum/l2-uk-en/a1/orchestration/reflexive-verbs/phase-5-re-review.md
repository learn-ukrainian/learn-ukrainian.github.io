## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Pedagogical Inconsistency
- **Location**: Section "Practice" / Callout "More examples"
- **Original**: "Чому ви **смієтеся**?"
- **Problem**: The module explicitly teaches the euphony rule: "Use **-сь** after vowels." The verb form "смієте" ends in a vowel ('е'), so according to the module's own rule, it should be "смієтесь". While "смієтеся" is grammatically correct in standard Ukrainian, it contradicts the simplified rule just taught to the beginner, potentially causing confusion.
- **Fix**: Change to "Чому ви **смієтесь**?"

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| Callout | "Чому ви смієтеся?" | "Чому ви смієтесь?" | Pedagogy/Consistency |

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test: 5/5
- Overwhelmed? [No]
- Instructions clear? [Yes]
- Quick wins? [Yes] (The "mirror" analogy and simple "vowel/consonant" rule)
- Ukrainian scary? [No]
- Come back tomorrow? [Yes]

Emotional beats: 5 found
- Welcome: "Imagine you are standing in front of a mirror."
- Curiosity: "The Secret Pronunciation: The 'Soft Buzz'"
- Quick wins: "Did you notice the pattern?" (Table explanation)
- Encouragement: "It makes you sound much more like a native speaker!"
- Progress: "In fact, you have already used a reflexive verb in your very first lesson!"

## Strengths
- **Analogy**: The "mirror" analogy for reflexive verbs is intuitive and effective for English speakers.
- **Phonetics**: Excellent, explicit instruction on the pronunciation of **-ться** [ц':а], which is a common stumbling block.
- **Structure**: The breakdown of reflexive verbs into three clear types (True, Reciprocal, Lexicalized) helps demystify why verbs like "сміятися" are reflexive.
- **Activity Design**: The "True/False: Reflexive Logic" activity is particularly good for checking conceptual understanding, not just mechanical conjugation.

## Verdict

**PASS**

This is a high-quality A1 module that effectively introduces a complex grammatical concept with clarity and warmth. The explanation of the **-ся/-сь** alternation is practical, and the activities provide ample practice. The single inconsistency found (using *-ся* after a vowel in one example) is minor and easily fixed to align with the pedagogical rules.
