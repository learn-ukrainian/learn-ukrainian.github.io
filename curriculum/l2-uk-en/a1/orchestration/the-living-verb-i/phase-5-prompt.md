## Files to Read (ALL REQUIRED)

Read ALL of these files from disk before writing anything:

1. **Content** (the lesson you're reviewing): `# The Living Verb I

До цього моменту ми говорили: це книга, то стіл. (This is a book. That is a table.). Але життя — це рух, дія! Час навчитися: я читаю, ти пишеш, ми працюємо.

Up until now, we've talked about what things **are** (Це книга. То стіл.). But life is movement, action! It's time to learn how to talk about what we **do**.

Today you unlock your first set of Ukrainian action verbs — the **First Conjugation (-ати verbs)**. These are verbs ending in **-ати** or **-яти**, and they're everywhere in daily life: читати (to read), писати (to write), працювати (to work), гуляти (to walk), грати (to play).

Mastering this pattern means you can suddenly talk about what you're doing **right now**. No more frozen sentences — your Ukrainian comes alive.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian verb conjugations are incredibly logical. Once you learn the First Conjugation pattern (this module), you've unlocked hundreds of verbs! They all follow the same rules, so if you know **читати → читаю**, you automatically know **працювати → працюю** and **гуляти → гуляю**. It's like getting a master key to Ukrainian action.

## Warm-up

Think about your typical day. You wake up. You eat breakfast. You read. You work. You walk. You play. Every single one of these actions uses an **-ати verb** in Ukrainian.

**Питання:** You read. You work. You walk. Ready to say it in Ukrainian?

---

## Presentation

### The Pattern: -ати → -аю, -аєш, -ає...

The **First Conjugation** (sometimes called the **е-conjugation**) includes verbs whose infinitive (dictionary form) ends in **-ати** or **-яти**.

> [!tip] **Grammar Secret: Aspect**
>
> All the verbs in this module are **imperfective** (недоконаний вид). This means they describe actions that are **ongoing, repeated, or habitual**.
>
> - **Я читаю** = I am reading (right now) OR I read (every day).
>
> In A2, you will learn «perfective» verbs for one-time completed actions (like «I finished reading»). For now, focus on these ongoing actions!

To conjugate them in the present tense, we:

1. Drop the **-ти** ending
2. Add personal endings based on **who** is doing the action

Let's take **читати** (chytaty — to read) as our example:

| Person   | Ukrainian    | Conjugation  | English                  |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| я        | я читаю      | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑju/   | I read                   |
| ти       | ти читаєш    | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑjeʃ/  | you read (informal)      |
| він/вона | він читає    | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑje/   | he/she reads             |
| ми       | ми читаємо   | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑjemɔ/ | we read                  |
| ви       | ви читаєте   | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑjete/ | you read (formal/plural) |
| вони     | вони читають | /t͡ʃɪˈtɑjutʲ/ | they read                |

**Key insight:** The stem is **чита-**. The endings tell you **who**: -ю (I), -єш (you), -є (he/she), -ємо (we), -єте (you all), -ють (they).

> 🎯 **Fun Fact**
>
> In Ukrainian, you often **drop the pronoun** because the verb ending already tells you who's doing the action! So instead of «Я читаю», Ukrainians often just say «Читаю» — the ending **-ю** makes it clear it's «I». This makes Ukrainian sound efficient and rhythmic.

### More Examples: The First Conjugation Family

Most First Conjugation verbs are very regular. Let's look at two common subgroups:

#### 1. Regular -ати/-яти Verbs

These verbs keep their stem exactly as it appears in the infinitive (minus -ти).

| Infinitive | Stem    | я form   | English         |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | --------------- |
| гуляти     | гуля-   | гуляю    | to walk, stroll |
| грати      | гра-    | граю     | to play         |
| співати    | співа-  | співаю   | to sing         |
| думати     | дума-   | думаю    | to think        |
| слухати    | слуха-  | слухаю   | to listen       |
| питати     | пита-   | питаю    | to ask          |
| розуміти   | розумі- | розумію  | to understand   |

#### 2. The працювати Type (-ва- Dropping Rule)

Many Ukrainian verbs end in **-ювати** or **-увати**. These are often new words or loanwords.

**The Rule:** In the present tense, the **-ва-** syllable drops out and is replaced by **-ю-** (or -у-).

This is why **працювати** becomes **працюю** (not «працюваю»).

**Memorize this pattern:**
- Infinitive: ...-ювати
- Present: ...-юю, -юєш, -ює

| Infinitive | Stem Drop | Conjugation (Я) | English |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **працювати** | працю~~ва~~- | **працюю** | to work |
| **танцювати** | танцю~~ва~~- | **танцюю** | to dance |
| **подорожувати** | подорожу~~ва~~- | **подорожую** | to travel |
| **малювати** | малю~~ва~~- | **малюю** | to paint/draw |

> 🧠 **Memory Trick**
>
> Imagine the **-ва-** is shy. It runs away when the action happens NOW (present tense)!
> But don't worry—it comes back in the past tense (as you'll see in M21).

> [!important] **Consonant Mutation**
> Some verbs like **писати** (to write) change their final consonant: **писати** → **пишу** (not «писаю»). Don't worry about the rules yet; just memorize the «я пишу» form for now!

> [!note] **Grammar Sneak Peek: The Object Changes**
>
> You might notice **книга** becomes **книгу** and **музика** becomes **музику** in some examples below. This happens when an action is done *to* something. Don't worry about the rules yet — just treat them as fixed phrases for now! We'll cover this properly in Module 11.

**Let's see them in action:**

- Я **пишу** лист. (I write a letter.) — /ˈpɪʃu lɪst/
- Ти **працюєш** тут? (Do you work here?) — /prɑˈt͡sʲujeʃ tut/
- Вона **гуляє** в парку. (She strolls in the park.) — /ɦuˈlʲɑje ʋ ˈparku/
- Ми **граємо**. (We play.) — /ˈɦrɑjemɔ/
- Ви **співаєте**. (You sing.) — /spiˈʋɑjete/
- Вони **думають**. (They think.) — /ˈdumɑjutʲ/
- Я **розумію** українську. (I understand Ukrainian.) — /rozuˈmiju ukrɑˈjinʲsʲku/
- Ти **слухаєш** музику. (You listen to music.) — /ˈsluxɑjeʃ ˈmuzɪku/

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment**
>
> In the Ukrainian dub of **Harry Potter**, when Hermione says «I'm reading!», she uses the verb **читаю** (chytayu). Just one word! In English, you need two words («I'm reading»), but Ukrainian packs both the subject and the continuous action into a single conjugated verb. Economy and elegance combined.

### Daily Life Verbs: -ати in Real Contexts

Here's how these verbs show up in real Ukrainian life:

**Ранок (Morning):**

- Я **снідаю**. (I have breakfast.) — /sniˈdɑju/
- Ти **починаєш** роботу. (You start work.) — /pɔt͡ʃɪˈnɑjeʃ rɔˈbɔtu/

**День (Day):**

- Вона **працює**. (She works.) — /prɑˈt͡sʲuje/
- Ми **обідаємо**. (We have lunch.) — /ɔbiˈdɑjemɔ/

**Вечір (Evening):**

- Ви **вечеряєте** вдома? (Do you have dinner at home?) — /ʋeˈt͡ʃerʲɑjete ˈʋdɔmɑ/
- Вони **відпочивають**. (They rest.) — /ʋidpɔˈt͡ʃɪʋɑjutʲ/

**Вільний час (Free Time):**

- Я **читаю** книгу. (I read a book.) — /t͡ʃɪˈtɑju ˈknɪɦu/
- Ти **граєш**. (You play.) — /ˈɦrɑjeʃ/
- Він **малює** картину. (He paints a picture.) — /mɑˈlʲuje kɑrˈtɪnu/
- Вона **співає**. (She sings.) — /spiˈʋɑje/

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> Walk into any Ukrainian café in Lviv and you might hear: «Ти **працюєш** сьогодні?» (Are you working today?). The barista asks this to decide if they'll pour you a strong espresso or a relaxing cappuccino. One verb — працюєш — and they know your whole vibe.

## Practice

### Mini-Dialogue 1: У парку (In the park)

**Setting:** Two friends meet at a park.

— Привіт! Ти **читаєш**? (Hi! Are you reading?)
— Так, **читаю** книгу. А ти? (Yes, I'm reading a book. And you?)
— Я **чекаю** друга. Він **працює** тут. (I'm waiting for a friend. He works here.)
— Де? (Where?)
— Тут. Він **знає** цей парк добре! (Here. He knows this park well!)

**Translation:**
— Hi! Are you reading?
— Yes, I'm reading a book. And you?
— I'm waiting for a friend. He works here.
— Where?
— Here, in the park. He knows this park well!

### Mini-Dialogue 2: Вдома (At home)

**Setting:** Friends talk at home.

— Ти **працюєш** сьогодні? (Do you work today?)
— Ні, я **відпочиваю**. **Слухаю** музику. (No, I rest. I listen to music.)
— А я **гуляю** в парку! (And I walk in the park!)
— Я теж **гуляю** там. (I also walk there.)

**Translation:**
— Do you work today?
— No, I rest. I listen to music.
— And I walk to the park!
— I also walk there.

> ⚡ **Pro Tip**
>
> The verb **робити** (to do/make) is tricky! Ukrainians actually use this verb in the **Second Conjugation**. We learn that in Module 08. For now, use **читаю, граю, гуляю** — those are pure First Conjugation gold.

---

## Cultural Insight

### Verbs and Ukrainian Soul

Ukrainians love action verbs. They reflect the culture's emphasis on **doing**, not just being. People in Ukraine ask: «Що ти робиш?» (What do you do?), «Ти читаєш?» (Do you read?).

Life is measured in verbs. What you **do** defines who you are.

And here's the beautiful part: Ukrainian verbs carry **musicality**. Listen to the rhythm:

- Я **чи-та-ю**, ти **чи-та-єш**, він **чи-та-є**...

The vowels (а, є, ю) flow like a melody. The consonants (т, в, л) give structure. This is why Ukrainian poetry and songs are so rich — the verbs themselves sing.

> 🎭 **Folklore Corner**
>
> In Ukrainian folk songs (пісні), **First Conjugation** verbs appear constantly because they describe daily life: **співати** (to sing), **танцювати** (to dance), **гуляти** (to stroll). The folk song «Ой ходила дівчина бережком» (A girl walked by the riverbank), collected in the songbook *Пісні маминого серця* (2006), uses First Conjugation verbs like **гуляє** in its verses. You're learning the very verb patterns that built Ukrainian folk expression.

### Reading: Мій день (My Day)

Я **снідаю**. (I have breakfast.)
Потім я **працюю**. (Then I work.)
Я **обідаю**. (I have lunch.)
Я **гуляю** в парку. (I walk in the park.)
Я **читаю** книгу. (I read a book.)
Я **слухаю** музику. (I listen to music.)
Я **думаю**. (I think.)

**Translation:**
I have breakfast. Then I work. I have lunch. I walk to the park. I read a book. I listen to music. I think.

# Підсумок

You've unlocked **First Conjugation verbs** (-ати/-яти)! You can now:

- Conjugate verbs like **читати, писати, працювати, грати**
- Describe daily routines and actions
- Form basic sentences like «Я читаю книгу» (I read a book)
- Understand the **-аю, -аєш, -ає, -аємо, -аєте, -ають** pattern

**Key Insight:** The verb ending tells you WHO is acting, so you can often drop the pronoun. «Читаю» = «I read.» Elegant, efficient, Ukrainian.

**Next up:** Module 07 — Questions & Negation. You learn questions and negation!

6. **Research notes** (if exists): `# Research: The Living Verb I — First Conjugation (-ати/-яти)

**Level:** A1 | **Module:** 06
**Researched:** 2026-02-07

## State Standard Reference
- Section: §4.2.4 (Особові форми дієслова — дієвідмінювання)
- Subsection: §4.2.4.1 (Дійсний спосіб — теперішній час)
- Required grammar: дієвідмінювання дієслів у теперішньому часі
- Exact paradigm from standard: читати (читаю, читаєш, читає, читаємо, читаєте, читають), працювати (працюю, працюєш, працює, працюємо, працюєте, працюють)
- Level placement: A1 — present tense conjugation is foundational, explicitly listed in §4.2.4.1 as first conjugation examples

## Vocabulary Check
- Core verbs (all First Conjugation, -ати pattern): читати, писати, знати, працювати, слухати, питати, грати, чекати
- Recommended: думати, розуміти, вивчати, відпочивати
- All are high-frequency daily-life verbs commonly found in A1 frequency lists
- Note: писати has consonant mutation (с→ш: пишу) — irregular for this pattern, flagged in module
- Note: працювати follows -ювати subpattern (-ва- drops in present tense: працюю)
- Frequency sources: All 8 required verbs appear in top-1000 Ukrainian word lists (ukrainianlessons.com/1000words, Leipzig Corpora Collection)

## Cultural Hook (verified)
- Fact 1: Ukrainian folk song "Ой ходила дівчина бережком" (collected in songbook "Пісні маминого серця", 2006) contains First Conjugation verbs including гуляє — demonstrates these verb patterns are the foundation of Ukrainian folk expression
- Source: nashe.com.ua/song/5732
- Fact 2: Pro-drop feature — Ukrainian verb endings encode the subject, making pronoun-dropping natural (Читаю = I read). This is a key typological feature distinguishing Ukrainian from English.
- Source: State Standard §4.2.4.1 demonstrates this with all paradigms showing person via ending alone
- How to use: Folk song reference fits Cultural Insight section; pro-drop fits Presentation section as grammar highlight

**Do not proceed until you have read every line of the content and every activity item.**

> **ANTI-STALE-REVIEW RULE**: This file may have been fixed since a previous review. You MUST review the CURRENT state of the files, not repeat findings from a prior review. If an issue was cited before but is now fixed, it must NOT appear in your review. Every finding must be verifiable by quoting the actual current content.

## Audit Metrics (Facts from Claude)

```

## STEP 1: PLAN VERIFICATION

Cross-check content against the plan file:

1. **Outline compliance**: Is every section from `content_outline` present as an H2/H3?
2. **Vocabulary scope**: List every Ukrainian vocabulary word taught in the content. Compare against `vocabulary_hints.required` in the plan. Flag any word NOT in the plan.
3. **Grammar scope**: What grammar does this module teach? What grammar from LATER modules appears in examples or dialogues? (This is scope creep — flag it.)
4. **Objectives**: Are all learning objectives from the plan addressed in the content?

Report findings as:
```
Plan-Content Alignment: [PASS/FAIL]
- Sections: [all present / missing: X, Y]
- Vocabulary: [X/Y from plan used, Z extra words found]
- Grammar scope: [clean / scope creep: specific items]
- Objectives: [all covered / missing: X]
```

---

## STEP 2: DEEP VERIFICATION (Line by Line)

### Ukrainian Sentences
Go through the file section by section. For EACH Ukrainian sentence:
- Is grammar correct? (cases, verb forms, agreement)
- Does it sound natural? (not robotic, not calqued from English)
- Are there Russianisms? (check against list below)
- Is vocabulary appropriate for the level?

### English Sentences
- Is it clear and accessible?
- Warm tutor voice or cold textbook?
- Over-explaining simple things? Under-explaining complex ones?

### IPA Transcriptions (if present)
- Every transcription must be checked for correct stress placement
- Ukrainian stress is unpredictable — verify each one
- Watch for English approximations instead of Ukrainian phonemes

### Activities (EVERY ITEM)

**CRITICAL: Read the actual YAML file line by line.** Do NOT assume what the file contains — read it. If a previous review said "add English cues" but the file already has them, acknowledge the fix is present. Never cite an issue that doesn't exist in the CURRENT file.

Check each activity item individually:
- **quiz**: Grammatically correct? Exactly one correct answer? Options plausible?
- **fill-in**: Sentence correct with answer filled in? Only ONE valid answer given the context/cues? Distractors plausible?
- **match-up**: All pairs correct? No duplicates?
- **true-false**: True statements actually true? False clearly false?
- **unjumble**: Answer forms a correct, natural sentence?
- **group-sort**: Items correctly categorized?
- **anagram**: Solution correct? Hint clear?

Count as you go. You MUST report how many items you checked.

**Verification rule**: For EVERY issue you cite, quote the EXACT line from the file. If you cannot quote it, the issue does not exist.

---

## STEP 3: AUTO-FAIL CHECKLIST

Check EVERY category. Report "[CLEAN]" or list specific findings.

### Russianisms
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| кушать | їсти |
| приймати участь | брати участь |
| самий кращий | найкращий |
| слідуючий | наступний |
| на протязі | протягом |
| любий (any) | будь-який |
| отвічати | відповідати |
| вообще | взагалі |
| получати | отримувати |
| відноситися | ставитися |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Calques
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| робити сенс | мати сенс |
| брати місце | відбуватися |
| це є | це (usually) |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Grammar Scope Violations
At module 6, students know ONLY modules 1-5. Any grammar from later modules is scope creep.
- Past tense (if not yet taught)
- Cases not yet introduced
- Verb forms not yet taught

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list specific violations with line numbers]

### Activity Errors
- Wrong answer marked as correct
- Multiple valid answers but only one accepted
- Grammatically incorrect sentences
- Duplicate items

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with activity number and item number]

### Beginner Safety ("Would I Continue?" Test)
| Question | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Did I feel overwhelmed? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Were instructions clear? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Did I get quick wins? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Was Ukrainian scary? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Would I come back tomorrow? | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Total** | **X/5** |

Emotional beats found:
- Welcome/orientation: [yes/no, where]
- Curiosity trigger: [yes/no, where]
- Quick wins: [count, where]
- Encouragement: [count, where]
- Progress marker: [yes/no, where]

---

## STEP 4: SCORE DIMENSIONS

**Score ONLY after completing Steps 1-3.** Each score must link to specific findings.

### Scoring Rules
- **9-10**: Excellent — no issues found in this dimension
- **7-8**: Good — minor issues found
- **5-6**: Needs work — multiple issues
- **<5**: Serious problems — major rewrite needed
- **If you found 3 grammar errors, Language cannot be 9**
- **If scope creep found, Relevance and Pedagogy cannot be 8+**

### Auto-Fail Thresholds
| Dimension | Auto-fail if below |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Experience Quality | <7 |
| Coherence | <7 |
| Relevance | <7 |
| Educational | <7 |
| Language | <8 |
| Pedagogy | <7 |
| Immersion | <6 |
| Activities | <7 |
| Richness | <6 |
| Beginner Safety | <7 |
| LLM Fingerprint | <7 |
| Linguistic Accuracy | <9 |

### Weighted Overall Score
```
Overall = (Experience × 1.5 + Coherence × 1.0 + Relevance × 1.0 + Educational × 1.2 +
          Language × 1.1 + Pedagogy × 1.2 + Immersion × 1.0 + Activities × 1.3 +
          Richness × 0.9 + Beginner_Safety × 1.3 + LLM × 1.0 + Linguistic_Accuracy × 1.5) / 14.0
```

**Quality target: 9.0+ overall AND no dimension below its auto-fail threshold.**
**If the score is below 9.0, you MUST provide a Fix Plan (see output format) with specific actions to reach 9/10.** The fix plan drives the iteration loop — Claude will send fixes to Gemini until the module reaches 9.0+.
