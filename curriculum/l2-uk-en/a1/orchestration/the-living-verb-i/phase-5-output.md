## Auto-Fail Checklist Results

- Russianisms: [CLEAN]
- Calques: [CLEAN]
- Grammar scope: [Locative case 'в парку' used 5x without note; acceptable for immersion but worth noting]
- Activity errors: [CLEAN]
- Beginner safety: 5/5

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: IPA Stress Error (снідати)
- **Location**: Line 124 / Section "Daily Life Verbs"
- **Original**: "/sniˈdɑju/"
- **Problem**: Incorrect stress. `снідати` is stressed on the first syllable (`сні́дати` -> `сні́даю`), not the second.
- **Fix**: Change to `/ˈsnidɑju/`

### Issue 2: IPA Stress Error (обідати)
- **Location**: Line 131 / Section "Daily Life Verbs"
- **Original**: "/ɔbiˈdɑjemɔ/"
- **Problem**: Incorrect stress. `обідати` is stressed on the second syllable (`обі́дати` -> `обі́даємо`), not the third.
- **Fix**: Change to `/ɔˈbidɑjemɔ/`

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| 124 | /sniˈdɑju/ | /ˈsnidɑju/ | IPA Stress |
| 131 | /ɔbiˈdɑjemɔ/ | /ɔˈbidɑjemɔ/ | IPA Stress |

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test: 5/5
- Overwhelmed? No
- Instructions clear? Yes
- Quick wins? Yes (Conjugating 8 verbs immediately)

## Strengths
- **Metaphor**: The "Master Key" framing for the First Conjugation is excellent for motivation.
- **Cultural Context**: The "Lviv Cafe" and "Harry Potter" examples ground the grammar in reality.
- **Activity Design**: The activities are robust, covering recognition, production, and sentence building.

## Fix Plan to Reach 9/10 (Linguistic Accuracy)

### Linguistic Accuracy: 8/10 → 10/10

**What to fix:**
1. Line 124: Change `/sniˈdɑju/` → `/ˈsnidɑju/` — Corrects stress on "снідаю".
2. Line 131: Change `/ɔbiˈdɑjemɔ/` → `/ɔˈbidɑjemɔ/` — Corrects stress on "обідаємо".

**Expected score after fix:** 10/10

### Projected Overall After Fixes

**9.4/10**

## Verification Summary

- Content lines read: 189
- Activity items checked: 45
- Ukrainian sentences verified: 28
- IPA transcriptions checked: 20
- Issues found: 2 (IPA stress)
- Naturalness score recommendation: 10/10

## Verdict

**PASS**

The module is excellent, engaging, and pedagogically sound. It passes the threshold easily, but the IPA stress errors for `снідаю` and `обідаємо` MUST be fixed to ensure accuracy.
