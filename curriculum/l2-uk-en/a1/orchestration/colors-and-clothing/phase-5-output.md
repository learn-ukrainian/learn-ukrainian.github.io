## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Mixed Language in Translation
- **Location**: Section "Presentation", Subsection "Basic Colors and Agreement", Paragraph 2
- **Original**: "(You can use them з будь-яким іменником.)"
- **Problem**: The English translation contains Ukrainian text that wasn't translated.
- **Fix**: Change to "(You can use them with any noun.)"

### Issue 2: Missing Core Color in Table
- **Location**: Section "Presentation", Table "Basic Colors"
- **Problem**: "Коричневий" (Brown) is listed in the plan as recommended, is used in the text ("Взуття коричневе"), and tested in activities, but is missing from the main reference table.
- **Fix**: Add a row for Brown: `| коричневий | коричнева | коричневе | коричневі | brown |`

### Issue 3: Unnatural English Phrasing in Activities
- **Location**: Activities file, Quiz "Що це?", items 9, 10, 12
- **Original**: "How do you say accurately 'Violet shirt'?", "What does the phrase ... accurately mean?", "What is accurately the English translation..."
- **Problem**: The placement of the word "accurately" is unnatural and repetitive.
- **Fix**: Remove "accurately" or rephrase to "What is the correct translation of..."

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| Presentation | з будь-яким іменником (in English parens) | with any noun | Editing Error |

"Would I Continue?" Test: 5/5
- Overwhelmed? [Pass]
- Instructions clear? [Pass]

## Strengths
- **Cultural Nuance**: Excellent explanation of *синій* vs *блакитний* and the "Myth Buster" callout.
- **Grammar Clarity**: Very clear distinction between *носити* and *одягати*, and the "plural only" nouns section is very helpful for A1 learners.
- **Activity Density**: 8 activities is a fantastic number for an A1 module, providing ample practice.

## Verdict

**PASS**

The module is excellent, with high activity density and clear pedagogical explanations. The only issues are a minor editing glitch in a translation and a missing row in the color table. These are easily fixed.
