# Questions & Negation

## Warm-up

You've learned to make statements in Ukrainian: «Я читаю книгу» (I read a book). But conversations aren't just statements - they're questions and answers, agreements and disagreements!

In English, asking «Do you read?» requires changing word order or adding «do/does». Ukrainian is simpler - you just add the little word **чи** at the beginning! And saying «no»? Just put **не** before the verb.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian is very flexible with questions. You can ask «Чи ти читаєш?» (formal) or just «Ти читаєш?» (casual, with rising intonation). Both work! Context and tone tell you it's a question.

## Presentation

### Yes/No Questions with Чи

The simplest way to turn any statement into a yes/no question is to add **чи** at the beginning:

| Statement      | Question (with чи) |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Ти читаєш.     | **Чи** ти читаєш?  |
| You read.      | Do you read?       |
| Вона працює.   | **Чи** вона працює? |
| She works.     | 
...
деш?»

**Mini-Dialogue 2: Getting to Know Someone**

— Як тебе звуть? (Yak tebe zvut?) — What's your name?
— Мене звуть Марко. (Mene zvut Marko.) — My name is Marko.
— Звідки ти? (Zvidky ty?) — Where are you from?
— Я з Києва. А ти? (Ya z Kyyeva. A ty?) — I'm from Kyiv. And you?
— Я з Америки. (Ya z Ameryky.) — I'm from America.

> [!note]
> The endings in **з Києва** (from Kyiv) and **з Америки** (from America) use a special grammar case you'll learn later. For now, just memorize the phrases!

### Negation with Не

To make a verb negative, just put **не** (ne) before it. Simple!

| Positive      | Negative          |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Я читаю.      | Я **не** читаю.   |
| I read.       | I don't read.     |
| Вона працює.  | Вона **не** працює. |
| She works.    | She doesn't work. |
| Ми знаємо.    | Ми **не** знаємо.  |
| We know.      | We don't know.    |

**Key difference from English:** In Ukrainian, you don't need «don't/doesn't/didn't» - just **не + verb**!

**Common negative constructions:**

- Я не розумію. = I don't understand.
- Я не знаю. = I don't know.
- Це не правда. = That's not true.

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> Ukrainians are very direct with negation. If you ask «Чи ти знаєш?», a simple «Ні, не знаю» is perfectly polite. No need to soften it with «I'm afraid I don't...» like in English! You can also say «На жаль, не знаю» (Unfortunately, I don't know) if you want to be extra polite.

**Negative questions:**

You can combine **чи** and **не** to ask negative questions — just like English «Don't you...?»:

- Чи ти не читаєш? = Don't you read?
- Чи вона не працює? = Doesn't she work?

This structure expresses mild surprise that something is not the case.

**Mini-Dialogue 3: Misunderstandings**

— Чи ти говориш англійською?
— Так, говорю. А ти?
— Ні, я не говорю англійською. Я говорю українською.
