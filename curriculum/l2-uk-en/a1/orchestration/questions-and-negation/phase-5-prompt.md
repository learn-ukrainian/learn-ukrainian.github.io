## Warm-up

You've learned to make statements in Ukrainian: «Я читаю книгу» (I read a book). But conversations aren't just statements - they're questions and answers, agreements and disagreements!

In English, asking «Do you read?» requires changing word order or adding «do/does». Ukrainian is simpler - you just add the little word **чи** at the beginning! And saying «no»? Just put **не** before the verb.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian is very flexible with questions. You can ask «Чи ти читаєш?» (formal) or just «Ти читаєш?» (casual, with rising intonation). Both work! Context and tone tell you it's a question.

## Presentation

### Yes/No Questions with Чи

The simplest way to turn any statement into a yes/no question is to add **чи** at the beginning:

| Statement      | Question (with чи) |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Ти читаєш.     | **Чи** ти читаєш?  |
| You read.      | Do you read?       |
| Вона працює.   | **Чи** вона працює? |
| She works.     | Does she work?     |
| Ми знаємо.     | **Чи** ми знаємо?  |
| We know.       | Do we know?        |

**The pattern:** Чи + subject + verb?

In casual speech, Ukrainians often skip **чи** and just use rising intonation:

- Ти читаєш? ↗ (You read? = Do you read?)

**Answering:**

- **Так** (Tak) = Yes
- **Ні** (Ni) = No

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment**
>
> In the Ukrainian dub of Marvel's Avengers, when someone asks «Ти читаєш?» (Do you read this?), they skip **чи** because it's action-packed! But in formal meetings, they use «Чи ви читаєте?» (Do you [formal] read?). Same question, different register!

**Mini-Dialogue 1: At a Café**

— Чи ти хочеш каву? (Chy ty khochesh kavu?)
— Так, дякую! (Tak, dyakuyu!)
— Чи ти знаєш, де туалет? (Chy ty znayesh, de tualet?)
— Ні, не знаю. (Ni, ne znayu.)

### Question Words

Ukrainian has question words (like English «what, who, where») that replace the unknown part of the sentence:

| Ukrainian    | IPA        | English          | Example                                |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **що**       | /ʃt͡ʃɔ/     | what             | Що ти читаєш? (What do you read?)      |
| **хто**      | /xtɔ/      | who              | Хто працює? (Who works?)               |
| **де**       | /dɛ/       | where (location) | Де ти? (Where are you?)                |
| **куди**     | /ˈkudɪ/    | where (to)       | Куди ти йдеш? (Where are you going?)   |
| **звідки**   | /ˈzʋidkɪ/  | where from       | Звідки ти? (Where are you from?)       |
| **коли**     | /kɔˈlɪ/    | when             | Коли ти працюєш? (When do you work?)   |
| **чому**     | /t͡ʃɔˈmu/   | why              | Чому ти читаєш? (Why do you read?)     |
| **як**       | /jɑk/      | how              | Як ти? (How are you?)                  |
| **скільки**  | /ˈskilʲkɪ/ | how much/many    | Скільки це коштує? (How much is this?) |

**Pattern:** Question word + verb + rest of sentence

Notice: Unlike English, you don't need «do/does» - the question word itself signals it's a question!

> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** «Question words must come first in Ukrainian.»
> **Fact:** While they usually do, Ukrainians often move them for emphasis! «Ти куди йдеш?» (You where going? = Where exactly are you going?) feels more urgent than «Куди ти йдеш?»

**Mini-Dialogue 2: Getting to Know Someone**

— Як тебе звуть? (Yak tebe zvut?) — What's your name?
— Мене звуть Марко. (Mene zvut Marko.) — My name is Marko.
— Звідки ти? (Zvidky ty?) — Where are you from?
— Я з Києва. А ти? (Ya z Kyyeva. A ty?) — I'm from Kyiv. And you?
— Я з Америки. (Ya z Ameryky.) — I'm from America.

### Negation with Не

To make a verb negative, just put **не** (ne) before it. Simple!

| Positive      | Negative          |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Я читаю.      | Я **не** читаю.   |
| I read.       | I don't read.     |
| Вона працює.  | Вона **не** працює. |
| She works.    | She doesn't work. |
| Ми знаємо.    | Ми **не** знаємо.  |
| We know.      | We don't know.    |

**Key difference from English:** In Ukrainian, you don't need «don't/doesn't/didn't» - just **не + verb**!

**Common negative constructions:**

- Я не розумію. = I don't understand.
- Я не знаю. = I don't know.
- Це не правда. = That's not true.

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> Ukrainians are very direct with negation. If you ask «Чи ти знаєш?», a simple «Ні, не знаю» is perfectly polite. No need to soften it with «I'm afraid I don't...» like in English! You can also say «На жаль, не знаю» (Unfortunately, I don't know) if you want to be extra polite.

**Negative questions:**

You can combine **чи** and **не** to ask negative questions — just like English «Don't you...?»:

- Чи ти не читаєш? = Don't you read?
- Чи вона не працює? = Doesn't she work?

This structure expresses mild surprise that something is not the case.

**Mini-Dialogue 3: Misunderstandings**

— Чи ти говориш англійською?
— Так, говорю. А ти?
— Ні, я не говорю англійською. Я говорю українською.
— Добре! Ми говоримо українською!

### Frequency Adverbs

When talking about how often you do things, Ukrainian uses these adverbs:

| Adverb        | IPA          | English   | Example                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **завжди**    | /ˈzɑʋʒdɪ/    | always    | Я завжди читаю. (I always read.)                             |
| **часто**     | /ˈt͡ʃɑstɔ/    | often     | Вона часто працює. (She often works.)                        |
| **іноді**     | /iˈnɔdi/     | sometimes | Ми іноді говоримо. (We sometimes talk.)                      |
| **рідко**     | /ˈridkɔ/     | rarely    | Він рідко пише. (He rarely writes.)                          |
| **ніколи**    | /nʲiˈkɔlɪ/   | never     | Я ніколи не читаю це. (I never read this.)                   |
| **зазвичай**  | /zɑzʋɪˈt͡ʃɑj/ | usually   | Я зазвичай читаю вдома. (I usually read at home.)            |

**Important:** **Ніколи** (never) is already negative, but Ukrainian uses **double negation** - you still add **не**!

- Я **ніколи не** читаю це. (I never read this.) ✅
- Я ніколи читаю це. ❌ (Wrong - missing не!)

This is called **double negation** and it's mandatory in Ukrainian.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian loves double negation! «Я нічого не знаю» (I nothing don't know = I don't know anything) feels natural to Ukrainians. This pattern comes from older Slavic languages and makes negation extra clear. So remember: «ніколи» needs «не», «нічого» needs «не», «ніхто» needs «не»!

## Practice

Now you know:

- ✅ How to ask yes/no questions with **чи**
- ✅ Question words (що, хто, де, куди, коли, чому, як, скільки)
- ✅ How to say no with **не**
- ✅ Frequency adverbs (завжди, часто, іноді, рідко, ніколи, зазвичай)

**Try these yourself** — form the Ukrainian question, then check:

1. Ask: «Do you work?» → Чи ти працюєш?
2. Ask: «Where are you from?» → Звідки ти?
3. Say: «I don't understand.» → Я не розумію.

Got them? Great — now let's put it all together!

## Production

**Task: Create a conversation**

Imagine you meet someone new at a café in Lviv. Use what you learned to:

1. Ask their name (Як тебе звуть?)
2. Ask where they're from (Звідки ти?)
3. Ask if they read Ukrainian (Чи ти читаєш українською?)
4. Say something you don't do (Я не...)
5. Say something you always do (Я завжди...)

**Model Answer:**

— Привіт! Як тебе звуть? (Hi! What's your name?)
— Мене звуть Оля. А тебе? (My name is Olya. And yours?)
— Марко. Звідки ти? (Marko. Where are you from?)
— Я зі Львова. А ти? (I'm from Lviv. And you?)
— Я з Києва. Чи ти читаєш українською? (I'm from Kyiv. Do you read in Ukrainian?)
— Так! Я завжди читаю українською. А ти? (Yes! I always read in Ukrainian. And you?)
— Я часто читаю, але іноді не розумію. (I often read, but sometimes I don't understand.)
— Нічого! Це нормально. (No problem! That's normal.)

## Cultural Insight

**Ukrainian Directness with Questions**

Ukrainians are generally more direct than English speakers when asking questions. Simple questions are common even with new acquaintances - especially from older generations.

This isn't rude - it's genuine interest! Ukrainians value honesty and directness in conversation.

**Common Questions You'll Hear:**

- Звідки ти? (Where are you from?)
- Що ти робиш? (What do you do?)
- Чому ти вивчаєш українську? (Why do you study Ukrainian?)
- Чи ти хочеш каву? (Do you want coffee?)

> 🎭 **Culture Corner**
>
> When Ukrainians ask «Як справи?» (How are things?), they actually want to know! Unlike the English «How are you?» (often just a greeting), Ukrainians expect a real answer. Feel free to say «Не дуже добре» (Not so great) - they'll ask why and genuinely care.

**Level:** A1 | **Module:** 07
**Researched:** 2026-02-07

## State Standard Reference
- Section: §4.3.1 (Просте речення — Simple sentence)
- Required grammar:
  - Питальне речення: Чи студент відповідає? Чи це наш автобус?
  - Питальне речення зі спеціальними словами де, звідки, куди, що, хто: Де ви були вчора? Хто вам це сказав? Що тобі купити? Куди ви їдете?
  - Стверджувальні й заперечні речення: Він чекає. Він не чекає. Чекайте на нас! Не чекайте на нас!
- Level placement: A1 — questions and negation are core A1 syntax, explicitly in §4.3.1
- Note: §4.4.1.2 (A2) expands with "просте питальне інтонаційне речення" (intonation-only questions) and more question words (з ким?, про кого?)

## Vocabulary Check
- Core question words: що, хто, де, куди, звідки, коли, чому, як, скільки — all high-frequency function words
- Particles: чи (question particle), не (negation), так/ні (yes/no) — essential A1 vocabulary
- Frequency adverbs: завжди, часто, іноді, рідко, ніколи, звичайно — common A1 adverbs
- Note on double negation: ніколи не + verb is mandatory in Ukrainian (Standard examples at A2 §4.4.1.1: "подвійне заперечення: Ми ще нічого не приготували")

## Cultural Hook (verified)
- Fact 1: Ukrainian conversational directness — when Ukrainians ask "Як справи?" they expect a genuine answer, unlike the formulaic English "How are you?" Ukrainians value sincerity and directness in conversations.
- Source: speakua.com/blog/9-ways-to-say-hello-in-ukrainian; ukrainianlessons.com/greetings/
- How to use: Cultural Insight section — demonstrates that Ukrainian question culture reflects genuine interest, not mere formality

**Do not proceed until you have read every line of the content and every activity item.**

> **ANTI-STALE-REVIEW RULE**: This file may have been fixed since a previous review. You MUST review the CURRENT state of the files, not repeat findings from a prior review. If an issue was cited before but is now fixed, it must NOT appear in your review. Every finding must be verifiable by quoting the actual current content.

## Audit Metrics (Facts from Claude)

```
Word count:       1576 / 1131 (139%)

Vocabulary items: 0
Engagement boxes: 0
Immersion:        varies% (target: varies)
Audit status:     pending review
```

## STEP 1: PLAN VERIFICATION

Cross-check content against the plan file:

1. **Outline compliance**: Is every section from `content_outline` present as an H2/H3?
2. **Vocabulary scope**: List every Ukrainian vocabulary word taught in the content. Compare against `vocabulary_hints.required` in the plan. Flag any word NOT in the plan.
3. **Grammar scope**: What grammar does this module teach? What grammar from LATER modules appears in examples or dialogues? (This is scope creep — flag it.)
4. **Objectives**: Are all learning objectives from the plan addressed in the content?

Report findings as:
```
Plan-Content Alignment: [PASS/FAIL]
- Sections: [all present / missing: X, Y]
- Vocabulary: [X/Y from plan used, Z extra words found]
- Grammar scope: [clean / scope creep: specific items]
- Objectives: [all covered / missing: X]
```

---

## STEP 2: DEEP VERIFICATION (Line by Line)

### Ukrainian Sentences
Go through the file section by section. For EACH Ukrainian sentence:
- Is grammar correct? (cases, verb forms, agreement)
- Does it sound natural? (not robotic, not calqued from English)
- Are there Russianisms? (check against list below)
- Is vocabulary appropriate for the level?

### English Sentences
- Is it clear and accessible?
- Warm tutor voice or cold textbook?
- Over-explaining simple things? Under-explaining complex ones?

### IPA Transcriptions (if present)
- Every transcription must be checked for correct stress placement
- Ukrainian stress is unpredictable — verify each one
- Watch for English approximations instead of Ukrainian phonemes

### Activities (EVERY ITEM)

**CRITICAL: Read the actual YAML file line by line.** Do NOT assume what the file contains — read it. If a previous review said "add English cues" but the file already has them, acknowledge the fix is present. Never cite an issue that doesn't exist in the CURRENT file.

Check each activity item individually:
- **quiz**: Grammatically correct? Exactly one correct answer? Options plausible?
- **fill-in**: Sentence correct with answer filled in? Only ONE valid answer given the context/cues? Distractors plausible?
- **match-up**: All pairs correct? No duplicates?
- **true-false**: True statements actually true? False clearly false?
- **unjumble**: Answer forms a correct, natural sentence?
- **group-sort**: Items correctly categorized?
- **anagram**: Solution correct? Hint clear?

Count as you go. You MUST report how many items you checked.

**Verification rule**: For EVERY issue you cite, quote the EXACT line from the file. If you cannot quote it, the issue does not exist.

---

## STEP 3: AUTO-FAIL CHECKLIST

Check EVERY category. Report "[CLEAN]" or list specific findings.

### Russianisms
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| кушать | їсти |
| приймати участь | брати участь |
| самий кращий | найкращий |
| слідуючий | наступний |
| на протязі | протягом |
| любий (any) | будь-який |
| отвічати | відповідати |
| вообще | взагалі |
| получати | отримувати |
| відноситися | ставитися |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Calques
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| робити сенс | мати сенс |
| брати місце | відбуватися |
| це є | це (usually) |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Grammar Scope Violations
At module 7, students know ONLY modules 1-6. Any grammar from later modules is scope creep.
- Past tense (if not yet taught)
- Cases not yet introduced
- Verb forms not yet taught

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list specific violations with line numbers]

### Activity Errors
- Wrong answer marked as correct
- Multiple valid answers but only one accepted
- Grammatically incorrect sentences
- Duplicate items

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with activity number and item number]

### Beginner Safety ("Would I Continue?" Test)
| Question | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Did I feel overwhelmed? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Were instructions clear? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Did I get quick wins? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Was Ukrainian scary? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Would I come back tomorrow? | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Total** | **X/5** |

Emotional beats found:
- Welcome/orientation: [yes/no, where]
- Curiosity trigger: [yes/no, where]
- Quick wins: [count, where]
- Encouragement: [count, where]
- Progress marker: [yes/no, where]

---

## STEP 4: SCORE DIMENSIONS

**Score ONLY after completing Steps 1-3.** Each score must link to specific findings.

### Scoring Rules
- **9-10**: Excellent — no issues found in this dimension
- **7-8**: Good — minor issues found
- **5-6**: Needs work — multiple issues
- **<5**: Serious problems — major rewrite needed
- **If you found 3 grammar errors, Language cannot be 9**
- **If scope creep found, Relevance and Pedagogy cannot be 8+**

### Auto-Fail Thresholds
| Dimension | Auto-fail if below |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Experience Quality | <7 |
| Coherence | <7 |
| Relevance | <7 |
| Educational | <7 |
| Language | <8 |
| Pedagogy | <7 |
| Immersion | <6 |
| Activities | <7 |
| Richness | <6 |
| Beginner Safety | <7 |
| LLM Fingerprint | <7 |
| Linguistic Accuracy | <9 |

### Weighted Overall Score
```
Overall = (Experience × 1.5 + Coherence × 1.0 + Relevance × 1.0 + Educational × 1.2 +
          Language × 1.1 + Pedagogy × 1.2 + Immersion × 1.0 + Activities × 1.3 +
          Richness × 0.9 + Beginner_Safety × 1.3 + LLM × 1.0 + Linguistic_Accuracy × 1.5) / 14.0
```

**Quality target: 9.0+ overall AND no dimension below its auto-fail threshold.**
**If the score is below 9.0, you MUST provide a Fix Plan (see output format) with specific actions to reach 9/10.** The fix plan drives the iteration loop — Claude will send fixes to Gemini until the module reaches 9.0+.
