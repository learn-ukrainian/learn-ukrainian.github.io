# Food & Shopping

## Warm-up

You're in Kyiv, and your fridge is empty. Time to go shopping! In Ukraine, you have many choices: the **супермаркет** (supermarket), a traditional **ринок** (market), or small **магазини** (stores) scattered throughout every neighborhood. Each place has its own character and culture.

Today, you'll learn how to navigate Ukrainian stores and cafés with confidence. You'll order food, ask for prices, and even do some everyday shopping beyond the grocery aisle.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainians love their **ринки** (markets)! Fresh produce, homemade cheeses, and seasonal fruits are sold by vendors who've been selling at the same spot for decades. It's not just shopping—it's a social experience. You greet the vendors, they remember your preferences, and you bargain a little. Try saying "Скільки коштує?" (How much is it?) at Besarabsky Market in Kyiv!
## Presentation

### Grammar Review: Accusative and Genitive Together

You've already learned the **accusative case** (M11: direct objects) and the **genitive case** (M16: absence and possession). Now you'll use BOTH in real shopping situations.

**Патерн 1: Знахідний відмінок (Accusative for "I want X")**

Я хочу **каву**. (I want coffee.)
Вона бере **хліб**. (She takes bread.)
Ми купуємо **рибу**. (We buy fish.)
Ти візьмеш **салат**? (Will you take a salad?)
Вони купують **овочі**. (They buy vegetables.)
Я хочу **суп** та **хліб**. (I want soup and bread.)

**Патерн 2: Родовий відмінок для кількості (Genitive for quantities)**

Склянку **води**, будь ласка. (A glass **of water**, please.)
Кілограм **яблук**. (A kilogram **of apples**.)
Пачку **цукру**. (A pack **of sugar**.)
Пляшку **вина**. (A bottle **of wine**.)
Чашку **кави**. (A cup **of coffee**.)

**Патерн 3: Питання про ціну (Asking prices)**

Скільки коштує **мило**? (How much is the soap?)
Скільки коштує **сир**? (How much is the cheese?)
Скільки коштує **хліб**? (How much is the bread?)
Скільки коштує **кава**? (How much is the coffee?)

Notice: After "скільки коштує" (how much is/does it cost?), the noun stays in **nominative** because the question is "What costs how much?"

> 🌍 **Реальний світ: У супермаркеті (Real World: At the Supermarket)**
>
> Супермаркети в Україні працюють як у всьому світі. (Supermarkets in Ukraine work like everywhere in the world.) You grab a **пакет** (bag) or basket at the entrance, pick your items, and pay at the **каса** (checkout). Але є культурна порада: українські касири дуже швидкі! (But here's a cultural tip: Ukrainian cashiers are VERY fast!) Have your money ready! Багато магазинів мають ваги для овочів окремо. (Many stores have scales for vegetables separately.) Look for the digital scales in the produce section.

> 💡 **Чи знаєте ви? (Did You Know?)**
>
> Популярні українські супермаркети: **Сільпо** (Silpo), **АТБ** (ATB), **Новус** (Novus), **Фора** (Fora). (Popular Ukrainian supermarkets: Silpo, ATB, Novus, Fora.) Кожен має свою атмосферу! (Each has its own atmosphere!) ATB is budget-friendly, Silpo is mid-range with good quality, and Novus is more upscale. Де ви любите робити покупки? (Where do you like to shop?)

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. – Grocery Run Edition**
>
> In the iconic Ukrainian game *S.T.A.L.K.E.R.*, your character scavenges for supplies in the Chornobyl zone. Imagine if you could just go to a **магазин** instead! "Я хочу **консерви** та **хліб**!" (I want canned food and bread!). Sadly, no cashiers in the Zone—just mutants and radiation. Real-life Ukrainian stores are much friendlier, we promise.

## Practice

### Mini-Dialogue 1: At the Café

**Context:** Марія and Іван are at a cozy café in Lviv.

— Що ти будеш замовляти? (What will you order?)
— Я візьму **каву** та **десерт**. А ти? (I'll take coffee and dessert. And you?)
— Я хочу **чай** та **салат**, будь ласка. (I want tea and salad, please.)
— **Офіціант**! Можна **меню**? (Waiter! Can we have the menu?)
— Так, зараз принесу. (Yes, I'll bring it now.)

> **Grammar Note:** Візьму = "I'll take" (future tense, perfective). Don't worry about aspect yet—just learn it as a useful phrase for ordering.

### Mini-Dialogue 2: At the Store

**Context:** Олег is buying groceries at a neighborhood магазин.

— Добрий день! Скільки коштує **хліб**? (Good day! How much is the bread?)
— 25 гривень. (25 hryvnias.)
— Добре. Ще **молоко** та **сир**. (Good. Also milk and cheese.)
— Разом 120 гривень. (120 hryvnias total.)
— Ось **гроші**. Дякую! (Here's the money. Thank you!)
— Дякую! До побачення! (Thank you! Goodbye!)

> **Cultural Tip:** In small Ukrainian stores, it's polite to greet the **продавець** (salesperson) when you enter and say "Дякую, до побачення" when you leave—even if you don't buy anything!

### Mini-Dialogue 3: Asking for Help

**Context:** Anna is looking for hygiene products at a супермаркет.

— Вибачте, де **мило** та **шампунь**? (Excuse me, where are soap and shampoo?)
— Другий поверх, секція "Гігієна". (Second floor, "Hygiene" section.)
— А **зубна паста** там теж? (Is toothpaste there too?)
— Так, все там. (Yes, everything is there.)
— Дякую! (Thank you!)

### Mini-Dialogue 4: At the Market

**Context:** Petro is shopping at a Kyiv ринок (market).

— Добрий день! Скільки коштує **картопля**? (Good day! How much are the potatoes?)
— Двадцять гривень кілограм. Дуже свіжа! (Twenty hryvnias per kilogram. Very fresh!)
— Добре. Я візьму два кілограми. (Good. I'll take two kilograms.)
— А **овочі**? **Помідори** дуже смачні! (And vegetables? The tomatoes are very tasty!)
— Ні, дякую. Тільки **картопля**. (No, thank you. Just potatoes.)
— Сорок гривень, будь ласка. (Forty hryvnias, please.)
— Ось гроші. Дякую! (Here's the money. Thank you!)
— Дякую! Хорошого дня! (Thank you! Have a good day!)

> 🎯 **Fun Fact: Supermarket Floors**
>
> Larger Ukrainian супермаркети often have multiple floors. Food is usually on the ground floor (перший поверх), and household goods upstairs. Escalators often have flat sections—perfect for rolling shopping carts up!

## Production

### Usage Patterns: How to Order Like a Local

**У ресторані/кафе (At a restaurant/café):**
1. **Привіт! Можна меню?** (Hi! Can I have the menu?)
2. **Я візьму...** (I'll take...)
3. **Рахунок, будь ласка.** (The bill, please.)
4. **Смачного!** (Enjoy your meal!)
5. **Було дуже смачно!** (It was very tasty!)

**У магазині (At a store):**
1. **Скільки коштує [item]?** (How much is [item]?)
2. **Я хочу [item], будь ласка.** (I want [item], please.)
3. **Ще щось?** — **Ні, дякую, все.** (Anything else? — No, thank you, that's all.)
4. **Де овочі?** (Where are the vegetables?)
5. **Це свіже?** (Is this fresh?)

**Поширені помилки (Common mistakes):**
- ❌ "Я хочу кава" → ✅ "Я хочу **каву**" (знахідний відмінок! / accusative!)
- ❌ "Скільки є хліб?" → ✅ "Скільки **коштує** хліб?" (використовуйте "коштує" для ціни / use "коштує" for price)
- ❌ "Одна вода" → ✅ "Склянку **води**" (родовий відмінок для кількості / genitive for quantities)
- ❌ "Каса там" → ✅ "Каса там?" (не забувайте знак питання! / don't forget the question mark!)
- ❌ "Хліб дорого" → ✅ "Хліб дорогий" (дорогий = adjective, not adverb)

### Real-World Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Ordering Lunch**

You're at a Ukrainian **їдальня** (canteen). The menu board lists: борщ (30 грн), вареники (45 грн), салат (25 грн), компот (15 грн).

What you say:
"Добрий день! Я візьму **борщ**, **вареники** та **компот**. Скільки разом?"

**Scenario 2: Grocery Shopping**

You need: bread, milk, eggs, cheese. You're at a **магазин** near your apartment.

What you say:
"Я хочу **хліб**, **молоко**, десять **яєць** та **сир**, будь ласка."

**Scenario 3: Buying Supplies**

You're a student and need: notebook, 2 pens, paper.

What you say:
"Я хочу **зошит**, дві **ручки** та **папір**."

> 📜 **History Bite: Ukrainian Cuisine Heritage**
>
> Ukrainian food culture is ancient! Borsch appears in 16th-century cookbooks. Varenyky (dumplings) have been a staple for centuries. During Soviet times, Ukrainian dishes were often rebranded as "Russian," but they originated in Ukrainian villages and Cossack kitchens. Today, UNESCO recognizes Ukrainian **borsch culture** as endangered heritage (2022), protecting its authenticity.

## Cultural Insight

### The Ukrainian Shopping Experience

**Markets vs. Supermarkets**

**Ринок (Market):**
- Fresh, seasonal produce
- Personal relationships with vendors
- Bargaining is acceptable
- Cash only, usually
- Open mornings (7 AM–2 PM peak)

**Супермаркет:**
- Western-style shopping
- Fixed prices
- Card payments accepted
- Open late (some 24/7)
- Self-service

**Local магазин:**
- Neighborhood stores
- Personal service (you ask, they get it)
- Good for quick purchases
- Often family-run

> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> **Myth:** "Ukrainians only shop at markets."
> **Fact:** While traditional **ринки** remain popular—especially for fresh produce—modern Ukrainians shop at supermarkets like Silpo, ATB, and Novus just like people everywhere. The mix of old and new is what makes Ukrainian shopping culture unique!

### Food as Identity

For Ukrainians, food is deeply connected to **identity** and **home**. Борщ isn't just soup—it's a symbol of family, tradition, and survival. During the Holodomor (1932-33 famine-genocide), millions of Ukrainians starved while grain was exported. Today, every bowl of borsch carries that historical memory.

When you order Ukrainian food, you're participating in a living tradition that survived empires, wars, and attempts to erase it.

**Українська кухня (Ukrainian cuisine):**
- **Борщ** – червоний суп (beet soup with sour cream)
- **Вареники** – дуже смачно! (dumplings: potato, cheese, or cherry)
- **Сало** – національна страва (cured pork fat, a delicacy!)
- **Голубці** – рис у капусті (cabbage rolls with rice)
- **Деруни** – картопляна страва (potato pancakes)
- **Сирники** – сирна страва (cheese pancakes)
- **Холодець** – традиційна страва (meat jelly)
- **Пампушки** – дуже смачно! (garlic rolls with borscht)

> 🎭 **Folklore Corner: Bread as Sacred**
>
> In Ukrainian tradition, **хліб** (bread) is sacred. Guests are greeted with **хліб-сіль** (bread and salt) as a sign of hospitality. Dropping bread on the floor requires picking it up and kissing it as an apology. This reverence comes from centuries of agricultural culture where grain was life itself.
