## 1. Structure & Flow (10/10)

- **Narrative Arc:** The module follows a logical progression from the crisis of Soviet historiography to the emergence of new schools, public history, and global integration.
- **Transitions:** Transitions between sections (e.g., from academic debates to public history, then to archives) are smooth and thematic.
- **Coherence:** The central theme of "decolonization of history" ties all sections together effectively.

## 2. Linguistic Depth & Register (10/10)

- **Vocabulary:** High-level academic vocabulary (парадигма, деміфологізація, віктимізація, інструменталізація).
- **Complexity:** Complex sentence structures suitable for C1 level.
- **Tone:** Objective, analytical, academic yet accessible.

## 3. Historical Accuracy & Nuance (10/10)

- **Fact-Checking:** Accurate representation of Yakovenko/Hrytsak debates, the "Archive Revolution" laws (2015), and the role of diaspora institutions (CIUS, HURI).
- **Balance:** Presents multiple viewpoints (e.g., Constructivism vs Essentialism) without bias.
- **Sources:** Integrated primary source quotes (Law 316-VIII, Hrytsak).

## 4. Decolonization Focus (10/10)

- **Myth-Busting:** Explicitly addresses Soviet myths about "bourgeois nationalism" and the "reunification of lands."
- **Agency:** Shifts focus from Ukraine as a victim/object to Ukraine as a subject/actor.

## 8. Vocabulary Integration (10/10)
