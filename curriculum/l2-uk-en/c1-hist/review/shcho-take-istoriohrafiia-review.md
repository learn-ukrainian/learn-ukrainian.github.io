## Experience Analysis (Tier 3)

|----------|--------|----------|

**Score: 5/5 = Lecture Quality 10/10** → Adjusted to 9/10 for minor pacing issues in Section 3

```

| Element | Score | Notes |

| **TENSION** | 2/2 | Three competing versions of Pereiaslav creates genuine intellectual conflict |
| **JOURNEY** | 2/2 | Progressive revelation: concepts → authors → Ukrainian tradition → practical tools |
| **CLIMAX** | 1.5/2 | Grushevsky section is strong but could be more dramatic |
| **RESOLUTION** | 2/2 | 5-question method provides practical closure |
| **CALL TO ACTION** | 2/2 | "Метод 5 питань" immediately applicable |

**Arc Score: 11.5/12 = 9.6/10**

## Weak Moments & Rewrites

### Weak Moment 1: MILD_TEXTBOOK_VOICE

**Location:** Line 145-147 (Літописці section opening)
**Original:**
> У середньовіччі історію писали переважно ченці — освічені люди, які мали доступ до письма в епоху, коли грамотність була рідкістю.

**Problem:** Competent but slightly dry opening for a new section. Could create more visual.

**Rewrite:**
> Уявіть скрипторій монастиря XII століття: єдина свічка, пергамент, чернець Нестор схиляється над текстом. Він пише «Повість минулих літ» — і через дев'ятсот років ми все ще читаємо його слова. Хто ці люди, що фіксували минуле?

**Status:** ⏳ Optional enhancement (current version acceptable)

### Weak Moment 2: MINOR_ENERGY_DROP

**Location:** Lines 163-172 (Академічні історики section)
**Original:** Technical description of academic methodology without vivid example.

**Problem:** After the medieval drama, academic section feels somewhat flat.

**Rewrite suggestion:** Add a brief anecdote about Grushevsky's exile or the "scandal" his thesis caused in Russian academic circles.

**Status:** ⏳ Optional enhancement

---

## Linguistic Accuracy Issues

**None found.** All historiographical terminology is accurate:
- "історіографія" correctly defined as study of historical writing
- "первинне/вторинне джерело" distinction accurate
- "наратив" vs "факт" distinction clear
- Grushevsky's thesis accurately presented
- No factual errors in dates or attributions

---

## Strengths

1. **Exceptional hook and framing** — Information war context creates immediate stakes for modern learners
2. **Three-version Pereiaslav example** — Brilliant pedagogical device that immediately demonstrates the module's core concept
3. **Practical 5-question method** — Gives learners an actionable tool they can use immediately
4. **Integrated decolonization perspective** — Not preachy, woven naturally into historiographical analysis
5. **Strong Ukrainian language quality** — Literary-level prose, appropriate for C1-HIST seminar
6. **Excellent activities** — Critical analysis tasks with comprehensive model answers allow self-study

---

## Issues

### Minor (Polish Only)

1. **Section 3 opening** — Could be more vivid (see Weak Moment 1)
2. **Academic historians section** — Slightly less engaging than surrounding content
3. **Summary section** — At 219 words, slightly under the 364-word target per plan (but content is complete)

### None Blocking

---

## Recommendation

✅ **PASS** — This is a strong opening module for the C1-HIST track. The lecture quality is high, the narrative arc is complete, and the practical application is immediate. The 5-question method is an excellent pedagogical tool that learners will use throughout the track. Minor polish opportunities exist but do not affect the overall quality.

---

## Action Items

1. **Consider adding vivid opening to Section 3** (Літописці) — ⏳ OPTIONAL
2. **Consider adding Grushevsky anecdote in Section 3** — ⏳ OPTIONAL
3. **Summary section slightly under word target** — ℹ️ NO ACTION NEEDED (content complete)
