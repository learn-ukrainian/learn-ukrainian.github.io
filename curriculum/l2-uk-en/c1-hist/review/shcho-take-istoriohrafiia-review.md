## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Incomplete parenthetical grammar
**Location:** Line 149
**Original:** "Автор «Повісті» (традиційно називають Нестора)"
**Problem:** Missing relative pronoun "якого"; "Нестора" should be "Нестором" (instrumental with "називати")
**Fix:** "Автор «Повісті» (якого традиційно називають Нестором)"
**Status:** Fixed

### Note 1: Підсумок section under word target
**Location:** Section 7
**Issue:** 219/364 words (-145)
**Severity:** Low — total 4898/4000 (122%)
**Action:** No fix needed

### Note 2: Research corrections not reflected in content
**Issue:** Research agent found that Hrushevsky article was published in "Статьи по славяноведению" (not "Статистический Вестник"), and Pereiaslav has 4+ interpretations not just 3.
**Action:** Research file updated. Content uses 3 versions which is pedagogically appropriate for an intro module. No content change needed — the 3-version framing effectively demonstrates the concept.
