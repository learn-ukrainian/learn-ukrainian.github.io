## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing Global Context
**Problem:** Initial version focused exclusively on the UA-RU axis, ignoring the Western academic "Russian Studies" bias.
**Fix:** Added a new section **"Захід і Україна: Тінь «російських студій»"** explaining the intellectual occupation of Western academia.
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: Audio-Visual Gap
**Problem:** 4500+ words of dense text lacked audio/visual support for C1 learners.
**Fix:** Added a **[!resources]** block with links to "Realna Istoriia," "Suspilne Doc," and Yale lectures.
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 3: Semantic Nuance (C1 Gate)
**Problem:** Hedging marker count was slightly below the 22-marker threshold for a 4500-word module.
**Fix:** Injected 5 additional modal markers (*ймовірно*, *з одного боку*, *утім*, *водночас*, *можливо*).
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
