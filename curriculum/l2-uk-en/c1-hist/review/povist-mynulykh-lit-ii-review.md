## Issues/Critique

**Review Method:** Self-correction during drafting.

1.  **Resolved:** Transliteration errors (`(Trickster)`, `(leitmotifs)`) were flagged and removed.
2.  **Resolved:** Forbidden activity (`match-up`) was removed.
3.  **Resolved:** Schema violation in `reading` activity fixed by splitting into Reading/Analysis.
4.  **Resolved:** Outline compliance Achieved by aligning metadata with markdown headers.

**Remaining/Minor points:**

- The text is virtually dense (4600+ words). Students may need to take breaks.
- No audio placeholders yet (not required for text audit).

## "Would I Stay?" Test

**Pass/Fail:** Pass (5/5).
**Narrative Arc:** Strong. Starts with "Is it true?", moves through specific legends, ends with "Future-building text".
**Emotional Peak:** The analysis of "Olga's Revenge" as a ritual inversion is a "Wow" moment.

## Summary

The module is a comprehensive, deep dive into the "Povist' mynulykh lit", covering textology, key legends (Olga, Varangians, Faith), and ideological purpose. It meets all C1 Seminar criteria: richness, immersion, and engagement.

## Verification

Checked against all constraints:

- Word count > 4500 (Passed)
- Activities schema (Passed)
- Transliteration (Clean)
- Outline compliance (Aligned)

## Verdict

**APPROVE**
