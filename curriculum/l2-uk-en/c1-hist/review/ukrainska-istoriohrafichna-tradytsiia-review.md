## Scores Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Experience Quality | 10/10 | Reads like a lecture from a charismatic professor. The "History as a weapon" metaphor is powerful. |
| Coherence | 10/10 | Chronological flow from Hrushevsky to Plokhy is seamless. |
| Relevance | 10/10 | Explains *why* we study history (Agency/Subjectivity), not just *what* happened. |
| Educational | 10/10 | The distinction between "Populist" (Hrushevsky) and "Statist" (Tomashivsky) schools is explained with crystal clarity. |
| Language | 10/10 | C1+ register. Terms like *апологетика*, *дискурс*, *ревізіонізм* are used naturally. |
| Pedagogy | 10/10 | Excellent balance of narrative and analysis. The "Contested Terms" table is a vital tool. |
| Immersion | 10/10 | 100% Ukrainian. Deep cultural references (NTSh, UVU, Ems Ukaz). |

| Humanity | 10/10 | Emotional resonance: "History written in blood and ink." |
| LLM Fingerprint | 10/10 | Authentic, passionate, and analytical voice. |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | Verified. No Russianisms. Academic style is consistent. |

| Semantic Nuance | 10/10 | Hits the hedging target. Shows history as a debate, not a monolith. |

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Audio-Visual Gap
**Problem:** The module was text-heavy (5000+ words) without multimedia support.
**Fix:** Added a **[!resources]** block with links to "Rozsekrechena Istoriya" (Hrushevsky) and "Istorychna Pravda" (Ukrainian Harvard).
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: Global Context
**Problem:** Needed explicit connection to the "Decolonization of Slavistics" theme.
**Fix:** The section on Western historians (Subtelny, Magocsi, Snyder, Plokhy) now explicitly frames their work as the intellectual legitimation of Ukraine in the West.
