## Scores Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Experience Quality | 10/10 | monumental depth. The transition from "Warrior" (Galician) to "Philosopher" (Volynian) is handled with cinematic precision. The module feels like a university seminar. |
| Coherence | 10/10 | Excellent structural flow. The argument builds layer by layer: style -> politics -> worldview. |
| Relevance | 10/10 | The "Magna Carta" comparison in the summary bridges the 13th and 21st centuries perfectly. |
| Educational | 10/10 | Deep philological analysis (soundscape, metaphors, numerology) provides real seminar value. The explanation of "providentialism" is accessible yet rigorous. |
| Language | 10/10 | Rich, academic Ukrainian. Terms like "секуляризація", "провіденціалізм", "топос" used organically. No Russianisms found. |
| Pedagogy | 9/10 | Strong use of "Myth Busters" and primary source analysis. The "Deep Dive" sections add significant value. |
| Immersion | 10/10 | 100% Ukrainian context. No Russian lens. The detail on the library (36 books) grounds the "philosopher" claim. |
| Activities | 10/10 | The essay prompt is rigorous. The "True/False" items test understanding of bias, not just facts. |
| Richness | 10/10 | The battle soundscape description ("тріск списів") and the visual imagery ("блиск зброї") are fantastic. |
| Humanity | 10/10 | The psychological portrait of Volodymyr's illness is moving and dignified. |
| LLM Fingerprint | 9/10 | Distinct academic voice. Minimal generic connectors. |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | Flawless. |
| Propaganda Filter | 10/10 | Explicitly deconstructs the "statelessness" myth. |
| Semantic Nuance | 10/10 | Great distinction between "dynastic" and "territorial" patriotism. |
