## Scores Breakdown

| Dimension           | Score | Notes                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Experience Quality  | 10/10 | The module opens with a powerful hook (Orwell) and maintains high intellectual engagement throughout. The "Battlefield" metaphor is sustained effectively. |
| Coherence           | 10/10 | Logical progression from theory (Halbwachs/Nora) to practice (Wars/Legislation) to future challenges. Transitions are smooth.                              |
| Relevance           | 10/10 | Perfectly aligns with the C1 goal of analyzing complex socio-political constructs. Direct hit on the "Memory Politics" topic.                              |
| Educational         | 10/10 | Explains complex concepts (postmemory, canon vs archive) with clear, relatable examples (Family stories vs Textbooks).                                     |
| Language            | 10/10 | High academic register. Terms like "сакралізація", "легітимація", "демаркування" used correctly. Natural Ukrainian phrasing.                               |
| Pedagogy            | 10/10 | Strong mix of theory and case studies. Analytical approach encourages critical thinking rather than rote memorization.                                     |
| Immersion           | 10/10 | 100% Ukrainian context. Even theoretical parts are grounded in Ukrainian realities (Bykivnia, Babyn Yar).                                                  |
| Activities          | 10/10 | activity file contains 6 well-structured tasks, including a deep "Fact vs Interpretation" analysis (12 items) and C1-level essay prompts.                  |
| Richness            | 10/10 | Excellent density of cultural references (Kurbas, Stus, Zabuzhko) and specific laws/dates. Callouts provided nice breaks.                                  |
| Humanity            | 10/10 | The tone is serious but empathetic ("це болісний шлях", "жива травма"). Recognizes the complexity of reconciliation.                                       |
| LLM Fingerprint     | 9/10  | Content feels curated and specific, avoiding generic "It is important to note" structures.                                                                 |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | Fact-checked: Leninfall stats (~2500/1300) are correct. Decommunization laws (2015) correctly identified.                                                  |
| Propaganda Filter   | 10/10 | Strong decolonized framing. "Great Patriotic War" myth is dismantled. "Banderivtsi" trope is analyzed as a weapon.                                         |
| Semantic Nuance     | 9/10  | Good use of hedging ("можливо", "з одного боку"). The analysis of "Competition of Victims" shows high nuance.                                              |

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Unjustified Anglicism

**Location:** Section 4 (Wars of Memory), paragraph on cartographic aggression.
**Original:** Це маніпуляція масштабу "cherry-picking" (вибіркове використання фактів)...
**Problem:** Using the raw English term "cherry-picking" in a C1 module is unnecessary when a precise Ukrainian equivalent exists. It lowers the register slightly.
**Fix:** Replace with "вибіркового добору фактів".

## Recommendation

✅ PASS — This is a flagship module for the C1 History track. It tackles a sophisticated topic with the required depth, theoretical grounding, and patriotic yet critical stance. The expansion of the "Tools" and "Legislation" sections has resolved the previous length issues and added significant value (Media/Cinema, Rehabilitation Law). The content is ready for production.
