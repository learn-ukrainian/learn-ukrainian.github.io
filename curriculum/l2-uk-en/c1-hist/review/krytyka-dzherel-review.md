## Scores/Assessment

| Metric              | Score | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :------------------ | :---- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Academic Depth**  | 10/10 | The module delves deep into historiographical theory (Ranke, Collingwood, White), paleography, and digital forensics. It avoids superficiality.                                                  |
| **Historiography**  | 10/10 | Excellent coverage of the "Kyivan Synopsis" paradox, James Mace's methodology, and the impact of the 1964 library fire. Strong use of specific historians (Hrushevsky, Antonovych, Zaliznyak).   |
| **Decolonization**  | 10/10 | The module explicitly frames source criticism as a tool for decolonization (e.g., debunking "Veles Book", analyzing imperial archives). The concept of "Archive Revolution" is well articulated. |
| **Engagement**      | 9/10  | The "Deconstruction of a Fake" and "Sultan Letter" case studies are highly engaging practical exercises. The "Professor Persona" is strong.                                                      |
| **Legibility**      | 9/10  | The text is dense but structured well with clear headers and callouts. Transitions are logical.                                                                                                  |
| **Immersion**       | 10/10 | Use of specific Ukrainian terminology ("інтуляція", "промульгація") and refusal to use Russian transliteration enhances immersion.                                                               |
| **Vocabulary**      | 8/10  | Rich vocabulary used (hermeneutics, heuristics, paleography), though the count might be slightly below the ambitious target of 25 _new_ terms explicitly listed in metadata.                     |
| **Overall Quality** | 10/10 | A flagship C1 module that meets the "University Lecture" standard perfectly. It challenges the student intellectually.                                                                           |

## Issues/Critique

1.  **Vocabulary Volume:** While the _text_ is rich, the metadata vocabulary list might need expansion to fully capture the depth of terms used (e.g., "сфрагістика", "дипломатика" could be added if not present).
2.  **Visual Descriptions:** The description of the Scythian Pectoral is vivid, but ideally, it would be accompanied by an actual image (technology limitation). The text compensates well.
3.  **Complexity:** The section on "Kyivan Synopsis" might be challenging for students without prior theological background, though the explanation is clear.

## Summary/Verification

The module has been rigorously audited and expanded.

- **Word Count:** >4500 words (Passes 4000 target).
- **Structure:** All outlined sections are present and expanded.
- **Transliteration:** All Latin script has been removed or replaced with Ukrainian equivalents.
- **Focus:** The central theme of "Source Criticism as Intellectual Self-Defense" is consistently maintained.

## Recommendation/Verdict

**PASS**. This module is ready for production. It sets a high bar for the C1 History track. It successfully integrates theory with practice and provides a strong decolonial narrative.
