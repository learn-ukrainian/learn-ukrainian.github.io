## Scores Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Experience Quality | 10/10 | The module turns dry legal history into a detective story. The "Ink and Paper" section adds tangible reality to the abstract concepts. |
| Coherence | 10/10 | Excellent logical flow from "what is a charter" to detailed diplomatics, specific examples, and finally the cultural impact (birch bark). |
| Relevance | 10/10 | Crucial for understanding the legal continuity of Ukrainian statehood. The quote "Документ — це застигла воля влади, яка пережила саму владу" perfectly captures the module's thesis. |
| Educational | 10/10 | Deep dive into diplomatics terms (sphragistics, paleography). The distinction that a charter "є перформативним актом" is a sophisticated academic insight. |
| Language | 10/10 | High-register academic Ukrainian. Terms like "секуляризацію права" are used correctly in the context of changing sanctions. |
| Pedagogy | 9/10 | Good balance of theory and primary source analysis. The comparison with chronicles is very effective. |
| Immersion | 10/10 | 100% Ukrainian context. Strong focus on local examples (Zvenyhorod birch bark, Lviv privileges). |
| Activities | 9/10 | The "Find the Forgery" activity is a brilliant application of the theoretical knowledge. |
| Richness | 10/10 | The details about "gall ink", "watermarks", and the specific contents of the Lviv Jewish privilege make the text dense and valuable. |
| Humanity | 10/10 | The section on "Birch Bark" humanizes history, showing the voices of women and children (Onfim). |
| LLM Fingerprint | 9/10 | Distinct academic voice. |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | Flawless. |
| Propaganda Filter | 10/10 | Explicitly counters the "Russian world" narrative by showing the distinctiveness of Ruthenian chancellery language. |
| Semantic Nuance | 9/10 | Good use of hedging when discussing the authenticity of Leo's charters. |
