## 1. General Overview

- **Title**: Києво-Печерський патерик (The Kyiv-Pechersk Patericon).
- **Genre**: Hagiography (агіографія), Patericon (патерик) - collection of lives of fathers/monks.
- **Date**: Compiled in early 13th century (1215-1230s). Basis: Correspondence between Simon and Polycarp.

## 2. Text History & Authorship

- **Primary Authors**:
  1.  **Simon** (Симон): Bishop of Vladimir-Suzdal (d. 1226). Wrote 9 stories + letter to Polycarp. Role: Mentor, rebuking Polycarp's vanity.
  2.  **Polycarp** (Полікарп): Monk of KP Lavra (d. 1182?). Wrote 11 stories + letter to Akindin. Role: Ambitious monk seeking bishopric, chastised by Simon. His stories are more vivid, folkloric.
  3.  **Nestor the Chronicler**: Wrote "Life of Theodosius" (integral part of later redactions).
- **Redactions**:
  - **Arsenian (1406)**: Oldest surviving copy. Commissioned by Bishop Arseniy of Tver (originally from Kyiv).
  - **Cassian (1460, 1462)**: Cassian (Kasiyan) rearranged the text chronologically/thematically. Most influential redaction.
  - **Printed editions**: 1635 (Sylvester Kosov, Polish), 1661 (Inokentiy Gizel, Church Slavonic - first printed in Kyiv).

## 3. Structure & Key Narratives

- **Structure**: Not linear history, but collection of "Slovo" (Words/Tales).
- **Themes**:
  - **Asceticism vs World**: Struggle with demons (besoborstvo), fasting, seclusion.
  - **Obedience**: Monastic discipline vs pride (Polycarp's arc).

  - **Moses the Hungarian**: Chastity vs Polish lust.

## 4. Historical Value (Source Criticism)

- **Political**:
  - Critical of princes (Svyatoslav II).
  - Monk's moral authority > Prince's power.
  - "Kyiv-centric" patriotism even in later redactions.
- **Social/Economic**:
  - Monastery as landowner.
  - Trade relations (salt, variety of goods).
  - Social origins of monks (boyars, merchants, commoners).
  - Famines and social unrest.
- **Daily Life**:
  - Food, clothing, cells, liturgy.
  - Medical practices (Agapitus vs secular medicine).
  - Crafts (icon painting, construction).

## 5. Life of Theodosius (Fragment Focus)

- **Author**: Nestor.
- **Childhood Narrative**:
  - Born in Vasylkiv, moved to Kursk.
  - **Topos**: "Old child" (старець дитя) - serious, avoided games, loved church.
  - **Conflict with Mother**:
    - Mother: Strong, "masculine" in body and voice. Wanted him to be a boyar/official.
    - Conflict: She beat him, chained him, hid his clothes to stop him from going to church/baking prosphora.
    - Resolution: He escaped to Kyiv to Anthony.
  - **Significance**:
    - Clash of values: Worldly success (Mother) vs Spiritual calling (Theodosius).
    - Psychological depth: Mother's love depicted as possessive and violent.

## 7. Decolonization Angles

- **Russian Appropriation**: Russia claims KPP as "Russian" literature. Need to emphasize:
  - Written in Kyiv.
  - Language features (Old Ukrainian redaction).
  - Simon and Polycarp were thoroughly "Kyivan" in mindset, even if Simon was bishop in Suzdal (he wished to be buried in Kyiv).
- **Myth Busting**: The "Norman" influence is minimal; focus on local Byzantine-Slavic synthesis.
- **Language**: Stress the continuity of Ukrainian words in the text (redaction dependent).
