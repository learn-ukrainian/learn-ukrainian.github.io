# Lesson Content

## warm-up

### Why Learn Cyrillic?

Ukrainian uses the Cyrillic alphabet - 33 letters total. Good news: many look familiar! This module covers 18 letters you can learn quickly.

The key insight: some letters LOOK like English but make DIFFERENT sounds. We call these "False Friends" - they'll trick you if you're not careful!

> 🔍 **Myth Buster: "Cyrillic is Russian"**
>
> Many people think Cyrillic = Russian. **Wrong!** The Cyrillic alphabet was created in the **9th century in Bulgaria** by disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius. It spread throughout the Slavic world - Russia adopted it centuries later. Today, Cyrillic is used by dozens of languages including Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Mongolian, and many others. Russian doesn't own it!

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian Cyrillic has **unique letters** that don't exist in Russian:
> - **Ї** (yi) - only Ukrainian has this!
> - **Є** (ye) - Ukrainian form
> - **Ґ** (hard g) - restored after independence
>
> When you see these letters, you know it's Ukrainian, not Russian!

## presentation

### Group 1: True Friends (7 letters)

These letters look AND sound like their Latin equivalents:

| Letter | Sound | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| А а | A (as in "father") | мАмА |
| Е е | E (as in "bet") | мЕтро |
| І і | I (as in "machine") | таксІ |
| О о | O (as in "hot") | фОтО |
| К к | K | Кафе |
| М м | M | Мама |
| Т т | T | Тато |

Trust these! They work exactly as you'd expect.

> 📜 **History Bite: The Greek Connection**
>
> Both the Latin alphabet (which English uses) and Cyrillic come from the **Greek alphabet**. That's why letters like A, E, K, M, O, and T look the same - they share Greek ancestors! When you see these "True Friends," you're seeing evidence of how alphabets evolved from ancient Greece to modern times.

### Group 2: False Friends (6 letters)

DANGER! These look Latin but sound completely different:

| Letter | Looks like | Actually sounds like |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| В в | B | V (as in "van") |
| Н н | H | N (as in "no") |
| Р р | P | R (rolled, as in Spanish) |
| С с | C | S (as in "sun") |
| У у | Y | U (as in "flute") |
| Х х | X | KH (as in German "Bach") |

Memorize these! They cause the most confusion for beginners.

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Remember the False Friends**
>
> Each letter looks like one thing but sounds like another:
> - **В** looks like B → sounds like **V** (as in Violin)
> - **Н** looks like H → sounds like **N** (as in Noon)
> - **Р** looks like P → sounds like **R** (rolled, like Spanish)
> - **С** looks like C → sounds like **S** (always soft)
> - **У** looks like Y → sounds like **U** (as in flUte)
> - **Х** looks like X → sounds like **KH** (German "Bach")
>
> Practice these daily until they become automatic!

> 🎯 **Fun Fact: Why the Confusion?**
>
> The "False Friends" exist because Cyrillic and Latin alphabets evolved separately from Greek. The Greek letter **Ρ** (rho) became **R** in Latin but **Р** in Cyrillic - same origin, different evolution! Similarly, Greek **Ν** (nu) became **N** in Latin but looks like **Н** in Cyrillic.

### Group 3: New But Easy (6 letters)

These don't exist in Latin but are straightforward:

| Letter | Sound | Memory tip |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Б б | B | Belly with a belt |
| Д д | D | Like a house |
| З з | Z | Like the number 3 |
| Л л | L | Like a tent |
| П п | P | Like a doorway/portal |
| Ф ф | F | Like a person with arms out |

> 🔗 **Language Link: B and V**
>
> Notice that Ukrainian has **two** letters for B-sounds: **Б** (true B) and **В** (V sound). English only has one! This is why some Ukrainian words borrowed into English seem to swap B and V. For example, the name "Volodymyr" (Володимир) is sometimes written "Vladimir" because Russian В sounds like V to English ears.

## practice

### Reading Strategy

When you see a Cyrillic word:
1. Go letter by letter
2. Watch for False Friends (В=V, Н=N, Р=R, С=S, У=U, Х=KH)
3. Sound it out slowly
4. Many words are cognates - they'll sound familiar!

### Try These Words

Sound out each word. Most are international words you'll recognize:

БАНК → B-A-N-K → bank
ПАРК → P-A-R-K → park
МЕТРО → M-E-T-R-O → metro
КАФЕ → K-A-F-E → café

> 🌍 **Real World: Cognates Everywhere**
>
> Ukrainian (like all languages) borrows international words. When you visit Ukraine, you'll see signs you can read immediately:
> - **БАНК** (bank)
> - **РЕСТОРАН** (restaurant)
> - **ГОТЕЛЬ** (hotel)
> - **АПТЕКА** (pharmacy - from Greek "apotheke"!)
>
> About 10-15% of everyday Ukrainian words are recognizable cognates. You already know more Ukrainian than you think!

## production

### Reading Challenge

Read these words without looking at transliteration:

1. МАМА
2. ТАТО
3. СТУДЕНТ
4. ФУТБОЛ
5. МУЗИКА

### False Friend Drill

Remember: П = P, Р = R, В = V, Н = N, С = S, Х = KH

Read these tricky words:
- СУПЕРМАРКЕТ (supermarket)
- РЕСТОРАН (restaurant)
- ПАСПОРТ (passport)

> 🎭 **Culture Corner: Names in Cyrillic**
>
> Ukrainian names follow Cyrillic spelling, which sometimes surprises English speakers:
> - **Харків** (Kharkiv) - the Х makes a "kh" sound
> - **Володимир** (Volodymyr) - В is V, not B
> - **Степан** (Stepan) - С is S, not "St"
>
> When you see Ukrainian names transliterated to English, you're seeing someone's attempt to represent Cyrillic sounds in Latin letters!
