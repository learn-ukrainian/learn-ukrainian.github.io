# Lesson Content

## warm-up

### Building Your Aspect Vocabulary

You know the basics: imperfective (process) vs perfective (completed). Now let's expand your verb pair collection!

**Quick review:**
- Imperfective: читати, писати, робити (process)
- Perfective: прочитати, написати, зробити (completed)

Today we'll learn more pairs and discover how prefixes change meaning.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian has about 20 common prefixes that create perfective verbs. Each prefix often adds a shade of meaning: при- (arrival), ви- (out/completion), за- (beginning), до- (completion/to). Learning these prefixes unlocks hundreds of verb pairs!

### More Common Aspect Pairs

**Daily action verbs:**

| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| відкривати | відкрити | to open |
| закривати | закрити | to close |
| починати | почати | to begin |
| кінчати | закінчити | to finish |
| брати | взяти | to take |
| класти | покласти | to put |
| вмикати | увімкнути | to turn on |
| вимикати | вимкнути | to turn off |

**Examples:**
- Я **відкриваю** вікно щоранку. (I open the window every morning - habit)
- Я **відкрив** вікно. (I opened the window - completed)
- Він **починає** роботу о дев'ятій. (He starts work at 9 - routine)
- Він **почав** нову книгу. (He started a new book - single action)

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: -ати/-ити Pattern**
>
> Many imperfective verbs end in -ати (відкривати, закривати, починати)
> Their perfective often ends in -ити or -ти (відкрити, закрити, почати)

### Communication Verbs

| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| говорити | сказати | to speak/say |
| питати | запитати | to ask |
| відповідати | відповісти | to answer |
| пояснювати | пояснити | to explain |
| розповідати | розповісти | to tell (a story) |
| запрошувати | запросити | to invite |
| дякувати | подякувати | to thank |

**Examples:**
- Вона **говорить** по телефону. (She's talking on the phone - process)
- Вона **сказала** "так." (She said "yes" - once)
- Я **питаю** його щодня. (I ask him every day - repeated)
- Я **запитав** його про роботу. (I asked him about work - once)

> 🎭 **Culture Corner: Asking vs Telling**
>
> Note the difference:
> - питати/запитати = to ask (a question)
> - просити/попросити = to ask (a favor, request)
> - розповідати/розповісти = to tell (a story, information)
> - казати/сказати = to tell/say (words)

### Motion Verbs: A Special Category

Motion verbs have their own aspect system:

**Going on foot:**
| Type | Imperfective | Perfective |
|------|--------------|------------|
| One direction | йти | піти |
| Round trip/habitual | ходити | — |

**Going by transport:**
| Type | Imperfective | Perfective |
|------|--------------|------------|
| One direction | їхати | поїхати |
| Round trip/habitual | їздити | — |

> 📝 **Note: No Perfective Forms**
>
> The multidirectional verbs (ходити, їздити) have **no perfective forms** because they describe repeated or non-specific motion. For completed single journeys, use prefixed forms of the unidirectional verbs:
> - ходити (habitual) → піти (completed single trip)
> - їздити (habitual) → поїхати (completed single trip)

**Examples:**
- Я **йду** на роботу. (I'm going to work - now, one direction)
- Я **ходжу** на роботу щодня. (I go to work daily - habitual)
- Вчора він **пішов** додому. (Yesterday he went home - completed)

- Вона **їде** до Львова. (She's going to Lviv - now, by transport)
- Вона **їздить** до Львова щомісяця. (She goes to Lviv monthly)
- Вона **поїхала** вчора. (She left yesterday - completed)

> 📜 **History Bite: Determinate vs Indeterminate**
>
> Slavic motion verbs originally had two stems: "determinate" (one direction, йти) and "indeterminate" (various directions, ходити). This ancient distinction survives in Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, and other Slavic languages. Most other Indo-European languages lost this feature!

### Prefix Meanings

Prefixes add meaning AND make verbs perfective:

**при- (arrival, addition):**
| Base | With при- | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|
| йти | прийти | to arrive (on foot) |
| їхати | приїхати | to arrive (by transport) |
| нести | принести | to bring |
| готувати | приготувати | to prepare |

**ви- (out, completion):**
| Base | With ви- | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| йти | вийти | to go out |
| їхати | виїхати | to drive out |
| пити | випити | to drink (up) |
| вчити | вивчити | to learn (completely) |

**за- (beginning, behind):**
| Base | With за- | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| співати | заспівати | to start singing |
| плакати | заплакати | to start crying |
| бігти | забігти | to run behind |

**до- (completion, reaching):**
| Base | With до- | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| читати | дочитати | to finish reading |
| їсти | доїсти | to finish eating |
| йти | дійти | to reach (on foot) |

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Prefix Stacking**
>
> You can even combine prefixes: при + ви + йти = привийти (to come out). But don't worry about this now - focus on basic prefixes first!

### Aspect Pairs with Different Stems

Some common verbs have completely different stems:

| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| говорити | сказати | to speak/say |
| брати | взяти | to take |
| класти | покласти | to put |
| шукати | знайти | to search/find |
| бачити | побачити | to see |
| чути | почути | to hear |

**Examples:**
- Я **шукаю** ключі. (I'm looking for the keys - process)
- Я **знайшов** ключі! (I found the keys! - result)
- Ти **бачиш** це? (Do you see this? - state)
- Ти **побачив** мене вчора? (Did you see me yesterday? - event)

### Asking Questions with Aspect

**Imperfective questions (about activity/process):**
- Що ти **робиш**? - What are you doing?
- Що ти **робив** учора? - What were you doing yesterday?
- Чи ти **читав** цю книгу? - Have you read this book? (experience)

**Perfective questions (about result/completion):**
- Що ти **зробив**? - What did you accomplish?
- Чи ти **прочитав** книгу? - Did you finish the book?
- Чи ти **знайшов** ключі? - Did you find the keys?

> 💡 **Key Insight**
>
> "Що ти робив?" = What were you up to? (general)
> "Що ти зробив?" = What did you get done? (results)

### Aspect in Commands (Imperative)

**Imperfective commands (general/polite):**
- **Читай**! - Read! (in general)
- **Сідай**! - Sit down! (invitation)
- **Говоріть** повільніше. - Speak more slowly.

**Perfective commands (specific/urgent):**
- **Прочитай** це! - Read this! (now, this thing)
- **Сядь**! - Sit! (do it now)
- **Скажіть** мені. - Tell me. (once)

**Negative commands usually imperfective:**
- **Не читай** це! - Don't read this!
- **Не говори** нікому! - Don't tell anyone!

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Negative Commands**
>
> Negative commands almost always use imperfective: "Не роби!" not "Не зроби!" This is because you're telling someone not to engage in the action at all.
