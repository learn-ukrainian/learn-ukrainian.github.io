# Lesson Content

## Warm-up

### Your voice matters

Until now, you've been learning to describe things — what exists, what happened, where to go. But at B1 level, you need to be able to say **what you think**.

Is learning languages difficult? What's the best season? Is it better to live in a city or a village?

There's no "right" answer to these questions. There's only your **думка** (opinion). Today you'll learn to express it — clearly, politely, persuasively.

> 💡 **Did you know?**
>
> In Ukrainian culture, a **justified** opinion is highly valued. A simple "I think so" usually isn't enough — an explanation with "because..." is expected. This differs from some cultures where simply stating your position is sufficient. When a Ukrainian asks "чому?" (why?) after your opinion — it's not a challenge, but an invitation to a deeper conversation!

## Presentation

### Expressing opinions

Ukrainian has many ways to express opinions, ranging from casual to formal:

**Direct expressions:**

| Ukrainian | English | Register |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Я думаю, що... | I think that... | neutral |
| Я вважаю, що... | I consider/believe that... | neutral-formal |
| Я гадаю, що... | I think/suppose that... | neutral |
| На мою думку, ... | In my opinion, ... | neutral |
| На мій погляд, ... | In my view, ... | formal |
| З моєї точки зору, ... | From my point of view, ... | formal |
| Мені здається, що... | It seems to me that... | softer |
| Як на мене, ... | As for me, ... | informal |

**Examples:**

- **Я думаю**, що це гарна ідея. — I think it's a good idea.
- **Я вважаю**, що він має рацію. — I believe he's right.
- **На мою думку**, це найкраще рішення. — In my opinion, this is the best solution.
- **Мені здається**, що ми помиляємося. — It seems to me we're wrong.
- **Як на мене**, це занадто дорого. — As for me, it's too expensive.

> 🔍 **Myth vs Fact**
>
> ❌ **Myth:** "Думати and вважати are the same."
>
> ✅ **Fact:** There's a subtle difference! **Думати** is the general, neutral option. **Вважати** is slightly stronger, implying a considered position. "Я думаю, буде дощ" (spontaneous) vs "Я вважаю, що освіта важлива" (considered position). In formal contexts (work, presentations), вважати sounds more professional.

### Expressing certainty

When you're confident about something, use these expressions:

**High certainty:**

| Ukrainian | English |
|-----------|---------|
| Я впевнений/а, що... | I'm sure that... |
| Я переконаний/а, що... | I'm convinced that... |
| Без сумніву, ... | Without a doubt, ... |
| Безперечно, ... | Undoubtedly, ... |
| Очевидно, що... | Obviously, ... |
| Звісно, що... | Of course, ... |

**Examples:**

- **Я впевнений**, що це правда. — I'm sure this is true.
- **Без сумніву**, він найкращий кандидат. — Without a doubt, he's the best candidate.
- **Очевидно**, що потрібні зміни. — Obviously, changes are needed.

> 💡 **Did you know?**
>
> The word **впевнений** comes from "певний" (certain), which shares a root with "віра" (faith). To be впевнений literally means "to have faith in something." Interestingly, the English "sure" is also related to Latin "securus" (without worry) — certainty as the absence of doubt!

### Expressing uncertainty (Hedging)

When you're less sure, use hedging expressions to soften your statements:

**Lower certainty:**

| Ukrainian | English |
|-----------|---------|
| Можливо, ... | Perhaps, ... |
| Напевно, ... | Probably, ... |
| Мабуть, ... | Probably, maybe... |
| Здається, ... | It seems... |
| Ймовірно, ... | Probably, likely... |
| Не впевнений/а, але... | Not sure, but... |
| Важко сказати, але... | Hard to say, but... |

**Examples:**

- **Можливо**, це правда. — Perhaps this is true.
- **Мабуть**, він запізниться. — He'll probably be late.
- **Не впевнений**, але здається, що так. — Not sure, but it seems so.

### Justifying your opinion

To support your opinion with reasons, use these conjunctions:

**Causal conjunctions:**

| Ukrainian | English |
|-----------|---------|
| тому що | because |
| оскільки | since, as |
| через те, що | because of the fact that |
| завдяки тому, що | thanks to the fact that |
| адже | for, since, because |
| бо | because (informal) |

**Examples:**

- Я так думаю, **тому що** це логічно. — I think so because it's logical.
- Вона права, **оскільки** має досвід. — She's right since she has experience.
- Це важливо, **адже** впливає на всіх. — This is important because it affects everyone.

> 💡 **Did you know?**
>
> The conjunction **адже** is a favorite in journalism and formal speech. It comes from "а" + "ж" + "є" and carries a nuance of "because it's just so" — as if you're appealing to a commonly known fact. "Адже всі знають, що..." ("After all, everyone knows that...") is a rhetorical device that makes your opinion more persuasive.

### Comparing viewpoints

Use these expressions to present different perspectives:

| Ukrainian | English |
|-----------|---------|
| З одного боку, ... з іншого боку, ... | On one hand, ... on the other hand, ... |
| На відміну від... | Unlike... |
| Порівняно з... | Compared to... |
| Проте / Однак | However |
| Незважаючи на те, що... | Despite the fact that... |

**Examples:**

- **З одного боку**, це дорого. **З іншого боку**, це якісно. — On one hand, it's expensive. On the other hand, it's quality.
- **На відміну від** інших, він завжди приходить вчасно. — Unlike others, he always comes on time.
- Це добре. **Проте** є недоліки. — This is good. However, there are drawbacks.

### Strengthening your argument

Use these expressions to emphasize key points:

| Ukrainian | English |
|-----------|---------|
| Головне, що... | The main thing is that... |
| Найважливіше, що... | The most important thing is that... |
| Перш за все, ... | First of all, ... |
| До того ж, ... | Moreover, ... |
| Крім того, ... | Besides, ... |
| Особливо... | Especially... |

**Examples:**

- **Головне**, що всі здорові. — The main thing is that everyone's healthy.
- **Перш за все**, це безпечно. — First of all, it's safe.
- **До того ж**, це ще й дешево. — Moreover, it's also cheap.

### Summarizing

Use these to wrap up your argument:

| Ukrainian | English |
|-----------|---------|
| Отже, ... | So, therefore, ... |
| Загалом, ... | In general, ... |
| Підсумовуючи, ... | Summarizing, ... |
| Одним словом, ... | In a word, ... |
| В цілому, ... | On the whole, ... |

**Examples:**

- **Отже**, ми вирішили погодитися. — So, we decided to agree.
- **Загалом**, я задоволений. — In general, I'm satisfied.
- **Підсумовуючи**, це був успіх. — Summarizing, it was a success.
