# Lesson Content

## warm-up

### Why Gender Matters

In Ukrainian, every single noun has a gender: **Masculine** (чоловічий рід), **Feminine** (жіночий рід), or **Neuter** (середній рід).

But knowing the gender isn't enough. You need to know **how the word changes**.
In English, words barely change (cat → cats). In Ukrainian, words change their endings constantly to show their role in the sentence (Cases).

To predict these changes, we group nouns into **4 Families** called **Declensions** (Відміни).
Think of them as "teams" that follow the same rules.

> 🔍 **Deep Theory: The System**
>
> Many courses teach "endings" (if it ends in -a, it's feminine). That works for A1.
> But to master Ukrainian (B1+), you need the **Declension System**.
> - **Group I:** The "-A/-YA" Team
> - **Group II:** The "Consonant & O/E" Team
> - **Group III:** The "Soft Feminine" Team
> - **Group IV:** The "Baby Animal" Team
>
> Learn the Team, and you'll know exactly how to change the word later!

## presentation

### Personal Pronouns (Subject)

Before we analyze nouns, we need the words to replace them!

| English | Ukrainian | Pronunciation |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **I** | **Я** | /ya/ |
| **You** (informal) | **Ти** | /tɪ/ |
| **He** | **Він** | /vin/ |
| **She** | **Вона** | /vɔˈnɑ/ |
| **It** | **Воно** | /vɔˈnɔ/ |
| **We** | **Ми** | /mɪ/ |
| **You** (formal/plural) | **Ви** | /vɪ/ |
| **They** | **Вони** | /vɔˈnɪ/ |

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Ти vs Ви**
>
> - **Ти** is for friends, family, children, and pets.
> - **Ви** is for strangers, elders, bosses, and groups of people (plural).
> When in doubt, use **Ви** to be polite!

### Group I: The "-A/-YA" Team (First Declension)

**Members:** Mostly **Feminine**, some **Masculine**.
**Identifier:** Ends in **-а** or **-я**.

| Word | Gender | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| мам**а** | Feminine | mom |
| кних**а** | Feminine | book |
| земл**я** | Feminine | earth |
| тат**о** → (Wait!) | Masculine | dad |

*Note on "Тато":* Wait, `тато` ends in -o? Actually, `тато` acts like a Group II noun in singular but has mixed behaviors.
Actually, let's look at standard Group I Masculines: **суддя** (judge), **Микола** (Mykola - name).
Most common Group I words are Feminine.

**Rule:** If it ends in **-а** or **-я**, it's usually **Group I**.

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Natural Gender Overrides**
>
> Words like **тато** (dad) refer to men, so they are **Masculine** gender.
> However, structurally, most textbooks put -a/-ya nouns here.
> *Correction:* `тато` ends in -o, so it looks like Group II, but strictly it declines like Group I in some dialects? No, `тато` is usually Group II (hard) in singular. Let's stick to clear examples.
> **Clear Group I Masculine:** суддя (judge), староста (elder).

### Group II: The "Main" Team (Second Declension)

This is the biggest group.
**Members:** **Masculine** (consonant) and **Neuter** (-o/-e).

**Identifier:**
1. **Masculine:** Ends in a **Consonant** (hard or soft) or **-й**.
2. **Neuter:** Ends in **-о**, **-е**, or **-я** (non-babies).

| Word | Gender | Ending |
|------|--------|--------|
| стіл | Masculine | Consonant (L) |
| музей | Masculine | -й |
| вікн**о** | Neuter | -о |
| мор**е** | Neuter | -е |
| весілл**я** | Neuter | -я (abstract) |

**Rule:**
- Consonant ending? → **Group II Masculine**.
- -O/-E ending? → **Group II Neuter**.

### Group III: The "Soft Feminine" Team (Third Declension)

**Members:** Exclusively **Feminine**.
**Identifier:** Ends in **-ь** (soft sign) or sibilant (sh/ch) + soft sign.

| Word | Gender | Ending |
|------|--------|--------|
| ніч | Feminine | -ч (implicitly soft context) |
| любов | Feminine | -в (unique exception) |
| радіст**ь** | Feminine | -ь |

**Distinguishing from Group II Masculine:**
- Group II Masculine: ден**ь** (day), вчител**ь** (teacher).
- Group III Feminine: ніч (night), тінь (shadow).
*How to tell?* You often have to memorize the gender of -ь words.
- **Hint:** Abstract nouns ending in **-ість** are ALWAYS Group III Feminine (радість - joy, якість - quality).

### Group IV: The "Baby" Team (Fourth Declension)

**Members:** **Neuter**.
**Identifier:** Ends in **-а/-я** but signifies a **young animal/being**.
**Secret Test:** When you change it, does a **-т-** appear?
- курч**а** (chick) → курча**т**а (chicks)
- ім'**я** (name) → імена (names) - *Wait, this is a special -en- suffix group, traditionally distinct but related.*

Let's stick to the core Group IV: **Baby Animals**.
- **теля** (calf)
- **кошеня** (kitten)
- **дівча** (little girl - neuter!)

**Rule:** Baby animal ending in -a/-ya? → **Group IV Neuter**.

> 🎯 **Summary Table: The 4 Declensions**
>
> | Group | Gender | Endings | Examples |
> |-------|--------|---------|----------|
> | **I** | Fem (mostly) | -а, -я | мама, сім'я |
> | **II** | Masc / Neut | Consonant, -о, -е | стіл, вікно |
> | **III** | Fem | -ь (some), -ість | ніч, радість |
> | **IV** | Neut | -а/-я (babies) | теля, курча |

## practice

### The Sorter

Categorize these nouns into Declension Groups:

1. **Книга** (book)
   - Ends in -а. Not a baby.
   > [!answer] **Group I** (Feminine)

2. **Стіл** (table)
   - Ends in consonant.
   > [!answer] **Group II** (Masculine)

3. **Вікно** (window)
   - Ends in -о.
   > [!answer] **Group II** (Neuter)

4. **Радість** (joy)
   - Ends in -ість.
   > [!answer] **Group III** (Feminine)

5. **Кошеня** (kitten)
   - Baby animal in -я.
   > [!answer] **Group IV** (Neuter)

### Gender Prediction

Now that you know the group, the gender is easy!

- Group I (book) → Feminine
- Group II Consonant (table) → Masculine
- Group II Vowel (window) → Neuter
- Group III (joy) → Feminine
- Group IV (kitten) → Neuter

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: The "Soft Sign" Danger**
>
> The hardest part is distinguishing **Group II Masculine** (-ь) from **Group III Feminine** (-ь).
> - **Masculine:** день (day), біль (pain), король (king)
> - **Feminine:** ніч (night), сіль (salt), осінь (autumn)
>
> Memorize these common ones!

## production

### Analyze New Words

Look at these words and determine: **Group** and **Gender**.

1. **Україна**

2. **Паспорт**
   - Ends in Consonant. Group II. Gender: Masculine.
3. **Сонце**
   - Ends in -е. Group II. Gender: Neuter.
4. **Любов**

### Exceptions Note

- **Тато** (dad): Ends in -о (Group II structure), acts Masculine.
- **Дядько** (uncle): Ends in -о (Group II structure), acts Masculine.
- **Ім'я** (name): Ends in -я, but is Neuter (Ancient type).

   - [ ] Declension Group II (Masculine)
   - [ ] Declension Group III (Soft Feminine)
   - [ ] Declension Group IV (Baby Animals)
   > Group I = the "-а/-я team" - mostly feminine nouns

2. The noun "стіл" (table) ends in a consonant. What is its gender?
   - [x] Masculine
   - [ ] Feminine
   - [ ] Neuter
   - [ ] Can't determine
   > Consonant ending → Group II Masculine

3. Nouns ending in **-о** or **-е** are typically:
   - [ ] Masculine
   - [ ] Feminine
   - [x] Neuter (Group II)
   - [ ] Group IV
   > -о/-е endings = Group II Neuter (вікно, море)

4. How do you know "ніч" (night) is Feminine, not Masculine?
   - [ ] It ends in a vowel
   - [ ] It ends in a consonant, so it's masculine
   - [x] It belongs to Group III (soft feminine) - must memorize
   - [ ] All time words are feminine
   > -ь/-ч nouns can be M or F - "ніч" is Group III Feminine (exception!)

5. Words ending in **-ість** (like "радість" - joy) are always:
   - [ ] Masculine
   - [x] Feminine, Group III
   - [ ] Neuter
   - [ ] Group IV
   > The -ість ending = 100% Group III Feminine (abstract nouns)

6. The word "теля" (calf) ends in -я but is Neuter. Why?
   - [ ] All -я words are neuter
   - [x] It's a baby animal (Group IV)

   - [x] Воно (it)
   - [ ] Вони (they)

   - [ ] It's Group II
   - [ ] It's an irregular noun
   > Biological gender overrides grammatical rules for people

9. To predict how a noun changes in sentences (cases), you need to know:
   - [ ] Its English translation
   - [ ] Its stress position
   - [x] Its Declension Group
   - [ ] Its first letter
   > Declension Group = the "team" that determines all ending changes

    - [x] день (m) / ніч (f) - both end in soft consonant
    - [ ] вікно / море (both neuter)

    > День (day) is Masc Group II, ніч (night) is Fem Group III - same ending, different groups!

## true-false: Grammar Rules

> Determine if each statement about Ukrainian grammar is true or false.

- [x] Nouns ending in -а or -я are usually Feminine (Group I).
   > Correct! The "-а/-я team" is mostly feminine.

- [ ] All nouns ending in a consonant are Feminine.

   > Correct! Group IV = baby animals = always Neuter.

- [ ] "День" (day) and "ніч" (night) belong to the same Declension group.
   > Incorrect. День = Group II Masculine, ніч = Group III Feminine.

- [x] "Ти" is informal (friends/family), "Ви" is formal (strangers/elders).
   > Correct! When in doubt, use Ви to be polite.

- [x] Knowing a noun's Declension Group helps predict all its case endings.
   > Correct! That's why we learn "teams" not just individual endings.

- [ ] Words like "тато" (dad) are Feminine because they end in -о.
   > Incorrect. Natural gender overrides: тато refers to a male → Masculine.

- [x] Group II contains both Masculine (consonant) and Neuter (-о/-е) nouns.
   > Correct! It's the biggest "mixed" group.

# Declension Reference

## Why memorize groups?

When we start changing words (cases), each group has its own pattern.

| If you are in... | Accusative change? |
|------------------|-------------------|
| **Group I** | Yes (-у/-ю) |
| **Group II** | No (if inanimate) |
| **Group III** | No |
| **Group IV** | No |

Knowing the group now saves you headaches later!
