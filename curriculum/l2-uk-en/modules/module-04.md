# Lesson Content

## warm-up

### The Missing "Is"

One of the biggest surprises for English speakers learning Ukrainian: **there is no "is" in the present tense!**

In English, you say:
- "This **is** a book."
- "He **is** a student."
- "I **am** Ukrainian."

In Ukrainian, you simply say:
- "Це книга." (This — book.)
- "Він студент." (He — student.)
- "Я українець." (I — Ukrainian.)

The verb "to be" just **doesn't exist** in present tense Ukrainian! This is called "zero copula."

> 🔍 **Myth Buster: "It's Broken Grammar"**
>
> When English speakers first see "Це книга" (literally "This book"), they think something is missing. But Ukrainian isn't broken - it's just different! Many languages work this way:
> - **Russian:** Это книга (This book)
> - **Arabic:** هذا كتاب (This book)
> - **Hebrew:** זה ספר (This book)
> - **Hungarian:** Ez könyv (This book)
>
> English is actually the unusual one for requiring "is" everywhere!

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian **does** have a word for "is" - it's **є** (ye). But it's only used for:
> - Emphasis: "Я є українець!" (I AM Ukrainian! - emphatic)
> - Existence: "Є проблема" (There is a problem)
> - Formal/bureaucratic language
>
> In everyday speech, you'll almost never hear it in simple "X is Y" sentences.

## presentation

### Це = This Is

The word **Це** (tse) means "this" or "this is":

| Ukrainian | Literal | English |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Це книга. | This — book. | This is a book. |
| Це мама. | This — mom. | This is (my) mom. |
| Це Україна. | This — Ukraine. | This is Ukraine. |
| Це смачно! | This — delicious! | This is delicious! |

**Note:** "Це" doesn't change for gender or number. It's always just "Це"!

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Це vs. This/That**
>
> "Це" covers both "this" and "that" in casual speech. When you need to be specific:
> - **Це** = this (close) - most common
> - **То** = that (far) - less common
>
> For beginners, just use "Це" for everything - Ukrainians do this constantly!

> 🔗 **Language Link: Articles Disappear Too**
>
> Notice something else missing? Ukrainian has **no articles** (a, an, the)!
> - "Це книга" = "This is a book" OR "This is the book"
> - Context tells you which meaning applies
>
> This is common in Slavic languages. Russian, Polish, Czech - none have articles!

### Personal Pronouns

Here are all the personal pronouns you need:

| Person | Ukrainian | Transliteration | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| I | я | ya | Always lowercase unless starting sentence |
| you (informal) | ти | ty | Use with friends, family, children |
| he | він | vin | Matches masculine nouns |
| she | вона | vona | Matches feminine nouns |
| it | воно | vono | Matches neuter nouns |
| we | ми | my | |
| you (formal/plural) | ви | vy | Polite "you" OR plural "you all" |
| they | вони | vony | All genders |

> 📜 **History Bite: The Ви/ти Split**
>
> Like French (vous/tu) and German (Sie/du), Ukrainian has formal and informal "you":
> - **ти** = informal, intimate, for friends/family
> - **Ви** = formal, respectful, for strangers/elders
>
> This distinction came to Slavic languages from Western European court culture in the 17th-18th centuries. It's not ancient - Old Ukrainian just had "ты" for everyone!

> 🎭 **Culture Corner: When to Use Ви**
>
> Use **Ви** (formal you) with:
> - Strangers, until they say "давай на ти" (let's use ти)
> - Older people (especially those 15+ years older)
> - Bosses and authority figures
> - Official/business situations
>
> But! Modern Ukraine is becoming more casual. Young people often skip straight to ти with peers. When in doubt, start with Ви - they'll tell you if it's too formal!

### Making Sentences

Without "is," sentence structure is simple:

**[Subject] + [What they are]**

| Subject | What They Are | Full Sentence | English |
|---------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Я | студент | Я студент. | I am a student. |
| Ти | вчитель? | Ти вчитель? | Are you a teacher? |
| Він | українець. | Він українець. | He is Ukrainian. |
| Вона | лікарка. | Вона лікарка. | She is a doctor. |
| Ми | друзі. | Ми друзі. | We are friends. |
| Вони | туристи. | Вони туристи. | They are tourists. |

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> To ask "Is this...?" you just add a question mark and raise your intonation:
> - **Це книга.** (This is a book.) ← statement
> - **Це книга?** (Is this a book?) ← question
>
> No word order change needed! Just change your tone of voice.

> 🎯 **Fun Fact: Nationality Words**
>
> Ukrainian nationality words change by gender:
> - **українець** (Ukrainian man) / **українка** (Ukrainian woman)
> - **американець** (American man) / **американка** (American woman)
> - **англієць** (English man) / **англійка** (English woman)
>
> You must use the correct form: "Я українка" (I'm Ukrainian - said by a woman).

## practice

### Building Sentences

Practice combining subjects with descriptions:

**With Це:**
- Це + мій друг = Це мій друг. (This is my friend.)
- Це + ваша книга? = Це ваша книга? (Is this your book?)
- Це + добре = Це добре. (This is good.)

**With pronouns:**
- Я + з України = Я з України. (I'm from Ukraine.)
- Вона + тут = Вона тут. (She is here.)
- Вони + студенти = Вони студенти. (They are students.)

### Question and Answer Patterns

**Pattern 1: Хто це? (Who is this?)**
- Хто це? - Це мій брат. (Who is this? - This is my brother.)
- Хто вона? - Вона моя сестра. (Who is she? - She is my sister.)

**Pattern 2: Що це? (What is this?)**
- Що це? - Це книга. (What is this? - This is a book.)
- Що це? - Це яблуко. (What is this? - This is an apple.)

> 🌍 **Real World: First Conversations**
>
> Here's a typical introduction:
>
> A: Привіт! Я Марія. А ти?
> (Hi! I'm Maria. And you?)
>
> B: Привіт! Я Іван. Ти студентка?
> (Hi! I'm Ivan. Are you a student?)
>
> A: Так, я студентка. А ти?
> (Yes, I'm a student. And you?)
>
> B: Я вчитель.
> (I'm a teacher.)
>
> Notice: no "am," no "are" - just subject + description!

## production

### Introduction Practice

Form sentences about yourself:
1. Я _______ . (your name)
2. Я з _______ . (your country)
3. Я _______ . (your profession or "студент/студентка")

### Point and Identify

Use "Це" to identify things around you:
- Це стіл. (This is a table.)
- Це книга. (This is a book.)
- Це вікно. (This is a window.)

### Make It a Question

Turn these statements into questions (just add ?):
- Це твоя книга. → Це твоя книга?
- Він студент. → Він студент?
- Вони українці. → Вони українці?

> ⚡ **Pro Tip: Emphasis with "Це"**
>
> You can add "Це" before pronouns for emphasis:
> - "Він студент." (He's a student.) - neutral
> - "Це він студент!" (THIS is the student!) - pointing him out
>
> This is like saying "THIS is the guy" in English.
