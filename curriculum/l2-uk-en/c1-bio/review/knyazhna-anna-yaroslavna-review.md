## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Vocabulary IPA Errors
**Location:** `vocabulary/knyazhna-anna-yaroslavna.yaml`
**Original:** Multiple IPA transcriptions used incorrect symbols (e.g., `/.../` slashes instead of `[...]`, English-style stress).
**Problem:** Non-standard IPA for Ukrainian.
**Fix:** Corrected all 25 IPA entries to standard format (e.g., `knʲɐʒˈnɑ`, `kɔrɔˈlɛʋɐ`).
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: Anachronistic Terminology
**Location:** `knyazhna-anna-yaroslavna.md`
**Original:** "амбасадорка", "агентність", "суб'єктність" in historical context without qualification.
**Problem:** While conceptually correct, these are modern terms.
**Fix:** Retained them as part of the *interpretive* framework (Introduction/Legacy) but ensured historical narrative uses period-appropriate language. The modern terms are justified by the "decolonization" focus of the module.
**Status:** ✅ Accepted (Intentional)
