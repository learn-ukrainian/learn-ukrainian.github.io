|---------|-------|-------|
| HOOK | 2/2 | Strong opening - "між зрадою та героїзмом" |
| TENSION | 2/2 | Peter I's betrayal, narrowing autonomy |

| CLIMAX | 2/2 | Baturyn massacre, Poltava |

### A+ Seminar Checklist: 7/8
- ✅ Vivid opening
- ✅ Primary sources woven in (Mazepa's Duma, Manifesto)
- ✅ Clear narrative thread
- ✅ Decolonization integrated (not preachy)
- ✅ Emotional peaks (Baturyn, exile)
- ✅ Modern relevance (corvette, 2018 anathema lifting)
- ✅ Memorable closing
- ⚠️ Call to action slightly generic

## Strengths

1. **Exceptional narrative voice** - Reads like a passionate historian's lecture, not a textbook
2. **Decolonization masterclass** - The "зрада" myth is dismantled with historical precision
3. **Cultural-political integration** - Patronage as state strategy brilliantly explained
4. **Primary sources** - Mazepa's Duma and Manifesto add authentic historical voice
5. **Modern resonance** - Corvette connection brings 300-year story to present

## Minor Suggestions (Not Required)

1. The "Потрібно більше практики?" section could include a discussion question
2. Could add a timeline visualization for key dates

## Recommendation

**✅ PASS** — This is an exemplary C1-BIO module demonstrating the Research-First Workflow in action. The 4275 words of rich content, native-quality Ukrainian (after 2 fixes), and compelling seminar-style narrative make this a model for other biography modules. Gemini produced excellent work with proper research preparation.
