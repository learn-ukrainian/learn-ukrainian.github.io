- Calques: [CLEAN]
- Grammar scope: [CLEAN]
- Activity errors: [reading-02 factual error]
- Beginner safety: 5/5

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Factual Error (Pope Name)
- **Location**: Activity `reading-02`, field `text` (approx line 61 in YAML)
- **Original**: "...посол від Папи **Інокентія III** з короною."
- **Problem**: Pope Innocent III died in 1216. The coronation in 1253 was authorized by **Pope Innocent IV**. The main content file correctly identifies him as "Інокентієм IV".
- **Fix**: Change "Інокентія III" to "Інокентія IV".

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| - | - | - | - |

(No language issues found in the content text.)

"Would I Continue?" Test: 5/5
- Overwhelmed? [No]
- Instructions clear? [Yes]
- Quick wins? [Yes]
- Ukrainian scary? [No (Appropriate for level)]
- Come back tomorrow? [Yes]

Emotional beats: 5 found
- Welcome: "Чому це важливо?" (Hook)
- Curiosity: "Король чи Князь?" (History bite)
- Encouragement: "Потрібно більше практики?"
- Depth: Myth-buster about Galician separatism.

## Strengths
- **Decolonization**: Excellent contrast with Alexander Nevsky and debunking of Soviet/Russian myths about "useless" coronation.
- **Narrative**: The biography is written as a compelling story, not just a list of dates.
- **Vocabulary**: Rich use of historical terms (`темник`, `баскак`, `ярлик`, `унія`).

## Fix Plan to Reach 10/10

### Activities: 9/10 → 10/10

**What to fix:**
1. File `curriculum/l2-uk-en/c1-bio/activities/danylo-halytskyi.yaml`: Find `id: reading-02`. In the `text` field, change "Папи Інокентія III" to "Папи Інокентія IV".

### Projected Overall After Fixes

```
10/10
```

## Verdict

The module is exceptional in quality, narrative depth, and linguistic richness. It meets all C1 requirements and provides a strong decolonial perspective. The only issue is a minor factual error (wrong Pope number) in one activity text, which is easily fixed.
