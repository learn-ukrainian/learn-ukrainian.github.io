## Auto-Fail Checklist Results

- Russianisms: [CLEAN]
- Calques: [CLEAN]
- Grammar scope: [CLEAN]
- Activity errors: [CLEAN]
- Beginner safety: 5/5

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Linguistic Accuracy (IPA)
- **Location**: Vocabulary YAML / Item `регентка`
- **Original**: `ipa: "[rɛˈɦɛntkɑ]"`
- **Problem**: Stress is placed on the second syllable (`ˈɦɛn`). In standard Ukrainian, `рЕгент` and `рЕгентка` usually retain stress on the first syllable.
- **Fix**: Change to `ipa: "[ˈrɛɦɛntkɑ]"`

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| Vocab | `[rɛˈɦɛntkɑ]` | `[ˈrɛɦɛntkɑ]` | Linguistic Accuracy (Stress) |

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test: 5/5
- Overwhelmed? [Pass] (Content is long but broken into digestible sections)
- Instructions clear? [Pass]
- Quick wins? [Pass] (True/False activity provides quick validation)
- Ukrainian scary? [Pass] (Appropriately challenging for C1)
- Come back tomorrow? [Pass]

Emotional beats: 4 found
- Welcome: Intro sets a high heroic tone.
- Curiosity: "Таємниця походження" section.
- Quick wins: T/F activity.
- Encouragement: Implicit in the inspiring tone of the legacy section.

## Strengths
- **Narrative Power**: The text reads like a high-quality historical essay, not a dry textbook. Phrases like "архітекторка державної волі" and "тріумф інтелекту над хаосом" are excellent.
- **Decolonization Focus**: The module explicitly addresses and debunks myths about "wild Rus", positioning Ukraine as a subject of history.
- **Structural Analysis**: The comparison table between Ihor and Olha is a fantastic pedagogical tool for C1 learners.

## Fix Plan to Reach 9/10

*Module exceeds 9.0 overall, but the minor IPA fix is recommended for perfection.*

### Linguistic Accuracy: 9/10 → 10/10

**What to fix:**
1. Vocabulary YAML: Change `ipa` for `регентка` from `"[rɛˈɦɛntkɑ]"` to `"[ˈrɛɦɛntkɑ]"`.

## Verification Summary

- Content lines read: ~300
- Activity items checked: 5 activities (approx 15 items)
- Ukrainian sentences verified: ~200
- IPA transcriptions checked: 25
- Issues found: 1 (Minor IPA stress)
- Naturalness score recommendation: 10/10

## Verdict

**PASS**

This is an exemplary C1 module that perfectly embodies the "Theory-First, Content-Driven" philosophy. The depth of analysis, richness of language, and patriotic yet academic tone are exactly what is required for the C1-BIO track. The single IPA stress issue is trivial and does not block approval.
