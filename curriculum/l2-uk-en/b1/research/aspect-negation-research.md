# Research: Вид у запереченні (Aspect in Negation)

**Module:** B1 M10
**Level:** B1 (Intermediate)
**Topic:** Aspect usage in negative sentences

## 1. Grammar: State Standard 2024 Reference

According to the **State Standard of Ukrainian as a Foreign Language (2024)**, proficiency level B1 requires mastery of verbal aspect nuances in negative contexts. Specifically:

> **Section: Morphology. The Verb. Category of Aspect.**
> "The student distinguishes between the meanings of imperfective and perfective aspects in negative sentences:
> *   **Imperfective (Недоконаний вид):** Used for the negation of the action itself (general negation), absence of action in the past, or prohibition (imperative). Example: *«Я не читав цієї книги»* (I haven't read this book - stating a fact).
> *   **Perfective (Доконаний вид):** Used to express the failure to achieve a result, often with *«ще»* (not yet), or a warning against an accidental action. Example: *«Я ще не прочитав цієї книги»* (I haven't finished reading this book yet)."

## 2. Vocabulary Frequency

For this topic, vocabulary is structural rather than thematic. The focus is on markers that trigger specific aspects.

### High Frequency (A1-A2 Review, Essential for B1)
*   **не** (not) + Imperfective (Default negation)
*   **ніколи** (never) + Imperfective (General negation)
*   **ні** (no/neither)
*   **заборонено** (forbidden)

### Key Collocations & Triggers (B1 Target)
*   **ще не** (not yet) + **Perfective** (High Frequency trigger)
    *   *ще не зробив* (haven't done it yet)
    *   *ще не прийшов* (hasn't arrived yet)
*   **не треба** (don't need to) + **Imperfective**
    *   *не треба говорити* (no need to speak)
*   **не можна** (not allowed) + **Imperfective**
*   **дивись не...** (watch out, don't...) + **Perfective** (Warning)
    *   *дивись не впади* (watch out, don't fall)
*   **випадково не...** (accidentally didn't...) + **Perfective**

## 3. Cultural Hook

### The "Superstitious Prohibition" (Warning vs. Command)
Ukrainian culture often distinguishes clearly between "Don't do this (it's forbidden)" and "Don't do this (accidental danger)."
*   **Fact:** In daily life, parents often use the **Perfective** imperative with *«не»* to warn children about accidents, often starting with *«гляди»* or *«дивись»* (watch out).
    *   *«Не впади!»* (Don't fall!) - implies accidental result.
    *   *«Не падай!»* (Don't fall!) - sounds like the child is falling on purpose repeatedly.
*   **Proverb:** *«Не кажи "гоп", поки не перескочиш»* (Don't say "hop" until you've jumped). This illustrates the aspect logic: *Не кажи* (Imperfective - general prohibition) vs. *не перескочиш* (Perfective - result).

## 4. Pedagogical Notes

### Key Differences from English
*   **The "I didn't" Ambiguity:** In English, "I didn't write the letter" is ambiguous. In Ukrainian, you must choose:
    *   *Я не писав листа* (Imperfective: I didn't engage in the activity of writing it).
    *   *Я не написав листа* (Perfective: I failed to complete it).
*   **The "Not Yet" Rule:** English learners often default to imperfective with "not yet". Ukrainian strictly prefers **Perfective** with *«ще не»* because the result is expected.

### Common Learner Errors
1.  **Overusing Perfective in Negation:** Learners often translate "I didn't buy bread" as *«Я не купив хліба»* (failed to buy), whereas the neutral statement of fact *«Я не купував хліба»* (didn't do the shopping) is often more appropriate for general context.
2.  **"Stop doing" errors:** Using Perfective for "Stop doing X". *«Не роби цього»* (Imperfective) is correct for stopping/forbidding.

### Teaching Sequence
1.  **Review:** Affirmative aspect pairs (read vs. finish reading).
2.  **The Golden Rule:** Negation usually flips the preference back to **Imperfective** (General Fact).
3.  **The Exception:** Teach *«ще не»* + **Perfective** as a rigid formula.
4.  **The Nuance:** Warnings (*не забудь* - don't forget) vs. Prohibitions (*не забувай* - don't be a forgetful person).

## 5. Scope Boundaries

### IN Scope (B1 Level)
*   **Past Tense:** Distinction between "didn't do" (Imp) and "didn't manage to do/haven't done yet" (Perf).
*   **Imperative Mood:** Prohibition (Imp) vs. Warning (Perf).
*   **Future Tense:** "I won't do it" (refusal - Imp) vs. "I won't get it done" (inability - Perf).
*   **Infinitive Constructions:** *не треба / не можна* + Imperfective.

### OUT of Scope (Save for B2/C1)
*   **Abstract/Stylistic Nuances:** Subtle usage in poetry or ironic contexts.
*   **Double Negation Logic:** Complex philosophical debates on negation.
*   **Oblique Moods:** Subjunctive with negation (unless basic conditionals).
*   **Complex Participle Negation:** *непрочитаний* vs *не прочитаний* (spelling rules are B2).
