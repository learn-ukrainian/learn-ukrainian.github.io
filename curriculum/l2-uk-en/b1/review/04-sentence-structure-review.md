## Sections 1-7: Standard Scoring Criteria

### 1. Coherence (5/5)

**Excellent logical organization:**

- Clear progression from motivation to terminology to practice
- Terminology introduced systematically: sentence parts -> clause types -> punctuation
- Tables used consistently for term presentation
- Each section builds on previous knowledge

**Flow markers:**

- Smooth transitions between sections
- "---" separators organize content appropriately
- Subsections logically grouped

**Evidence:**
> "Understanding how sentence parts relate is key to parsing complex Ukrainian sentences. The pidmet and prysudok form the core - everything else orbits around them."

### 2. Relevance (5/5)

**Perfect alignment with module objectives:**

- Title "Struktura rechennia" directly matches content
- All terminology relates to sentence structure analysis
- Examples use the terminology being taught
- Practice exercises test exactly what was taught

**Vocabulary matches topic:**
All 25 vocabulary items are syntactic terminology (pidmet, prysudok, dodatok, etc.)

### 3. Educational Value (5/5)

**Excellent for metalanguage acquisition:**

- Clear bilingual tables for each term category
- Etymology notes create memory hooks (e.g., "Skladnosuriadne comes from suriadnyi - coordinate")
- Real-world context shows where these terms are used
- Progressive examples from simple to complex sentences
- 6 mini-dialogues demonstrate terminology in authentic contexts

**Inductive discovery elements:**
- Tables presented before detailed explanations
- Pattern recognition exercises before rules

### 4. Language Quality (5/5)

**Ukrainian:**

**Scaffolding:** Excellent bilingual tables with Ukrainian term + English equivalent + examples
