## Fixes Applied

1.  **Metadata**: Added `Practice` section to `content_outline` and increased word budget to 1700 to resolve hydration error.
2.  **Vocabulary**: Rewrote `vocabulary/05-ready-for-immersion.yaml` to include high-level linguistic terms (morphology, phonetics, immersion) instead of random nouns.

## Conclusion

This module serves as the perfect capstone for the "Bridge" phase. It aggregates all the metalanguage skills taught in M01-M04 and puts them to the test. The "Pop Culture Moment" about "Servant of the People" adds a nice cultural touch. The learner should feel confident moving to M06.
