## 1. Module Overview

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Template** | `b1-grammar-module-template.md` | ✅ Compliant |
| **Word Count** | ~2800 words | ✅ Meets requirements (Target 2000+) |
| **Vocabulary** | 25 items | ✅ Matches frontmatter (Unreal conditional terms) |
| **Activities** | YAML | ✅ Found `32-conditionals-unreal-yakby.yaml` |
| **Overall Score** | **5/5** | Outstanding coverage of Unreal Conditionals. |

## 2. Quantitative Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | 1) Concept (Real vs Unreal), 2) Structure (*Yakby* + Past + *b*), 3) Types (Present vs Past logic). |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Critical for "Hypothetical Analysis" (Politics, History, Regret). |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | Explains the "Particle *b/by*" morphology perfectly (After Vowel vs Consonant). |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Distinguishes between "Hypothetical Dream" and "Regret about Past" using the SAME grammar (Context rule). |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | "Roleplay Games" (Witcher 3, Stalker) analogy is a brilliant hook for this grammar point. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Cultural references to "Nechuy-Levytsky" and "Franko" anchor the grammar in literature. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | YAML file present. Inline activities removed (Scenario A fixed). |
| **Richness** | 5/5 | "Ostroh Academy" historical note adds depth. |

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Morphological Clarity**: The rule for *b* (after vowel) vs *by* (after consonant) is often missed in textbooks but crucial for flow.
2.  **Logic Simplification**: Explicitly stating "Ukrainian doesn't distinguish Second/Third Conditional grammatically" relieves a huge cognitive burden from English speakers.
3.  **Cultural Resonance**: The "If I had wings" folk song example connects grammar to the soul of the language.

### Issues
*   **Fixed**: Duplicate activities were present in the Markdown file (Scenario A). They have been removed to prioritize the YAML single source of truth.

### Specific Content Checks

*   **Grammar**: Correct.
*   **Vocabulary**: 25 terms related to hypothesis/imagination.
*   **Formatting**: Clean.

## 4. Final Recommendation

**✅ PASS**

No further changes required.

### Action Items
-   [x] Remove inline activities from markdown (Fixed).
