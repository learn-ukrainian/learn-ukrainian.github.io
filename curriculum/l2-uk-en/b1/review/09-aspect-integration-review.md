## Overall Score: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommendation:** Excellent. This module tackles one of the most confusing aspects for learners (Three Future Forms?!) and simplifies it beautifully: "Process has two styles, Result has one."

## Scores Breakdown

| Criterion | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | 3-way comparison is handled very cleanly. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Future tense is essential. Stylistic difference (Conversation vs News) is high-value for B1. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | The "History Bite" explains *why* the synthetic form exists (from archaic "to have"), which demystifies it completely. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Clear distinction between *буду читати* and *читатиму*. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | Addressing the "Budu + Perfective" error (e.g., *буду прочитаю*) directly in the "Common Mistakes" section is vital. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Fortune Telling (Ворожіння) is a great cultural context for Future Tense. |
| **Activity Quality** | 5/5 | 12 activities. The "Select" activity questions stylistic nuance well. |
| **Word Salad** | ✅ NO | High density. |
| **Red Flags** | ✅ NONE | Clean module. |

## Strengths

### 1. **Linguistic History**
The explanation of the Synthetic Future (*читатиму*) as originating from *читати* + *йняти/мати* (to have to read) is brilliant. It turns a "weird ending to memorize" into a "cool historical fact."

### 2. **Stylistic Awareness**
Most courses just say "These forms are equal." This module correctly points out that *буду робити* is conversational standard, while *робитиму* is journalistic/formal. This prevents students from sounding like a newspaper in a café.

### 3. **Error Prevention**
The "Common Mistakes" section targets the specific error English speakers make: combining *will* (budu) with the Perfective (*budu prochytyyu*). This is preventative teaching at its best.

## Analysis by Section

### The Test (Introduction)
**Score: 5/5**. Presents the three forms side-by-side immediately.

### Explanation (Forms)
**Score: 5/5**. Detailed tables for all three. The warning "Perfective Future looks like Present Tense" is a crucial note.

### Comparison
**Score: 5/5**. The "Process vs Result" table clarifies when to use which.

### Dialogues
**Score: 5/5**. 6 dialogues showing a wide range of registers: casual chat between friends vs academic discussion with a professor.

## Issues Found
*None.*

---

## Pedagogical Analysis
- **Scaffolding:** Logical flow: Forms -> Meanings -> Styles.
- **Cognitive Load:** Moderate. The three forms are a lot to take in, but the structure handles it well.

---

## Vocabulary Analysis
**Count:** 25 terms.
**Quality:** Future time markers (*zgodom, skoro, maibutnie*).

---

## Activity Critique
**Volume:** 12 activities.
**Variety:** Quiz, Match-up, Fill-in, True-False, Group Sort, Unjumble, Error Correction, Cloze, Mark Words, Select, Dialogue Reorder, Translate.
**Quality:** The "Translate" activity specifically forces the learner to choose between *will read* (process) and *will finish reading* (result).

## Final Assessment
**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Recommendation:** Proceed. No changes needed.
