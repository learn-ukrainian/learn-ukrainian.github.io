## 1. Module Overview

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Template** | `b1-grammar-module-template.md` | ✅ Compliant |
| **Word Count** | ~2900 words | ✅ Meets requirements (Target 2000+) |
| **Vocabulary** | 25 items | ✅ Matches frontmatter (Logic connectors) |
| **Activities** | YAML | ✅ Found `33-conditionals-mixed-complex.activities.yaml` |
| **Overall Score** | **5/5** | Excellent breakdown of a very prominent B2/C1 concept simplified for B1. |

## 2. Quantitative Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | 1) Mixed Type 1 (Past->Present), 2) Mixed Type 2 (Present Trait->Past Event), 3) Chained conditions. Logic is perfect. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Essential for "Regret about Character" (If I were braver...) vs "Regret about Actions" (If I had done X...). |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | The visual breakdown of "Condition Time" vs "Consequence Time" is the only way to teach this. Well done. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Uses logic connectors *inakshe* (otherwise), *u takomu razi* (in that case) very naturally. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | "Chain of Consequences" (If A -> B, and if B -> C) is a great logical drill. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Cultural notes on Odessa humor and Kyiv proverbs fit the complexity theme. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | YAML file present. Inline activities removed (Scenario A fixed). |
| **Richness** | 5/5 | Philosophy of "Counterfactual Thinking" (what if internet wasn't invented) is engaging. |

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Logical Rigor**: The matrix of [Past/Present] x [Past/Present] is handled systematically.
2.  **Connector Variety**: Going beyond just *yakby*, introducing *inakshe* (otherwise) and *u takomu razi* (in that case) bridges the gap to B2 fluency.
3.  **Real-Life Complexity**: The "Career Regret" dialogue is exactly what adult learners need to express.

### Issues
*   **Fixed**: Duplicate activities were present in the Markdown file (Scenario A). They have been removed.
*   **Minor Note**: YAML filename is `33-conditionals-mixed-complex.activities.yaml` (includes `.activities`), which is slightly non-standard but functional. No action needed now.

### Specific Content Checks

*   **Grammar**: Correct.
*   **Vocabulary**: 25 terms.
*   **Formatting**: Clean.

## 4. Final Recommendation

**✅ PASS**

No further changes required.

### Action Items
-   [x] Remove inline activities from markdown (Fixed).
