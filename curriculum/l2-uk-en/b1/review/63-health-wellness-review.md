## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Modern Perspective**: It doesn't just stick to "I have a headache". It covers *mentalne zdorovia* and *terapiia*, reflecting modern discourse in Ukraine (especially post-2022).
2.  **Cultural Intelligence**: "Sanatoriums" as a concept of *profilaktyka* rather than just "hospital" is well explained.
3.  **Pragmatic Competence**: The note about Ukrainians using dimunitives or understatements ("trokhy bolyt") to avoid complaining is a brilliant insight for advanced learners.

### Issues
*   **Missing IPA**: The vocabulary table (Lines 360-397) lacks the IPA column.

### Specific Content Checks

*   **Grammar**: Correct.
*   **Vocabulary**: 35 terms.
*   **Formatting**: Clean.

## 4. Final Recommendation

**✅ PASS** (with minor note)

Excellent content. The focus on mental health makes this module particularly valuable and current.

### Action Items
*   [ ] (Future) Add IPA column to vocabulary table.
