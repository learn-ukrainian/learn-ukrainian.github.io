# Content Quality Review: Module 10 - Вид у запереченні

**Level:** B1
**Module:** 10
**Title:** Вид у запереченні
**Reviewed:** 2025-12-27
**Status:** ✅ PASS

---

## Overall Score: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommendation:** Outstanding. This module takes a topic that is usually taught as "Negation = Imperfective" (simplistic) and correctly teaches the "Expectation" rule (*ще не* + Perf) and "Warning" rule (*не* + Perf Imperative). This prevents learners from sounding like robots who never intend to finish anything.

## Scores Breakdown

| Criterion | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Logic: General Rule -> Exception 1 (Expectation) -> Exception 2 (Warning). |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Knowing how to say "I haven't done it *yet*" (vs "I didn't do it") is crucial conversationally. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | Excellent breakdown of *Не читай* (advice) vs *Не прочитай* (warning). |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Clear examples distinguishing *не робив* (fact) vs *ще не зробив* (plan). |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | TTT approach works well here to expose the "Why did he use Perfective with Ne?" gap. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Dialogues feel real (Restaurant: "Don't order the borsch today" - Specific Warning). |
| **Activity Quality** | 5/5 | 12 activities. Error correction specifically targets the *не прочитав* (without *ще*) error. |
| **Word Salad** | ✅ NO | High density. |
| **Red Flags** | ✅ NONE | Clean module. |

## Strengths

### 1. **The "Yet" Factor**
The distinction between *Я не читав* (I didn't read) and *Я ще не прочитав* (I haven't read *yet*) is the single most important takeaway. This module hammers it home beautifully.

### 2. **Imperative Nuance**
Teaching *Не забувай* (General advice) vs *Не забудь* (One-time urgency) is often left for B2 or C1. Including it here empowers learners to give real, urgent instructions.

### 3. **Contextual Logic**
The "Algorithm for Aspect Selection" section (Check context -> Apply rule -> Check logic) gives learners a mental flowchart effectively.

## Analysis by Section

### The Test (Introduction)
**Score: 5/5**. Contrasts "didn't do" vs "haven't done yet" vs "don't do!".

### Explanation (Exceptions)
**Score: 5/5**. The "Warning" category is explained very clearly with examples like *Не впусти телефон* (Don't drop the phone - obviously an accident/one-time event).

### Dialogues
**Score: 5/5**. 6 dialogues. The "Doctor" dialogue uses *Не забувайте* (general) and *Не забуду* (specific promise) in the same exchange perfectly.

## Issues Found
*None.*

---

## Pedagogical Analysis
- **Scaffolding:** Builds from the simple "Negation = Imp" rule to the nuanced exceptions.
- **Cognitive Load:** Moderate. The distinction is subtle but well-explained.

---

## Vocabulary Analysis
**Count:** 25 terms.
**Quality:** Negation spectrum (*nikoly, nide, nikhto*) plus phrases (*shche ne, vzhe ne*).

---

## Activity Critique
**Volume:** 12 activities.
**Variety:** Quiz, Match-up, Fill-in, True-False, Group Sort, Unjumble, Error Correction, Cloze, Mark Words, Dialogue Reorder, Select, Translate.
**Quality:** The "Match-up" activity links the Ukrainian form directly to the English nuance ("general negation" vs "but will").

## Final Assessment
**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Recommendation:** Proceed. No changes needed.
