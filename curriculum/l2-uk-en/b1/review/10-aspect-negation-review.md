| Relevance           | 10/10 | High. Negation aspect is a consistent source of errors for intermediate learners.            |
| Educational         | 10/10 | The distinction between "General Prohibition" and "Specific Warning" is very well explained. |
| Language            | 10/10 | Natural and idiomatic. Use of "Deruny" and "Kobzar" adds authentic flavor.                   |
| Pedagogy            | 10/10 | Logical algorithm provided to help learners make the right choice.                           |
| Immersion           | 10/10 | 99.2% immersion. Maintains the standard set in M06.                                          |
| Activities          | 10/10 | 14 activities, covering all targeted grammar points.                                         |
| Richness            | 10/10 | 95% score. Good situational variety (Library, Bookstore, Doctor, Dinner).                    |
| Humanity            | 10/10 | Practical and empathetic ("Don't worry," "I've never been lost").                            |
| LLM Fingerprint     | 10/10 | Clean structure, no repetitive AI transition phrases.                                        |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | Correct usage of Genitive case in negation, a subtle but vital detail correctly handled.     |

## Fixes Applied

1.  **Metadata**: Corrected hydration errors by redistributing word counts in `content_outline` to match the actual text density (Dialogue and Summary were significantly longer than projected).
2.  **Vocabulary**: Cleaned up `vocabulary/10-aspect-negation.yaml` to remove typos and hallucinations, focusing on the negation markers and contrastive aspect pairs.

## Conclusion

This module completes the "Aspect & Tense" phase of B1.1 with high precision. It tackles one of the most counter-intuitive parts of the aspect system (the shift to imperfective in negation) with clear, actionable rules. The dialogues are particularly strong in this module, feeling like real-life interactions.
