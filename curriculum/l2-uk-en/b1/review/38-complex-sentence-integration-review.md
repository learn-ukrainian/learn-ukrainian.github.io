## Scores Breakdown

| Dimension           | Score | Notes                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clarity             | 10/10 | Deconstructs complex syntax into manageable "levels" (2-level, 3-level).                  |
| Structure           | 10/10 | Logical progression: Coordination -> Subordination -> Combination.                        |
| Relevance           | 10/10 | "Grammar Integration" is the capstone skill for B1 fluency.                               |
| Language            | 10/10 | References to Lina Kostenko and Ivan Franko justify learning complex syntax.              |
| Pedagogy            | 10/10 | Step-by-step "algorithm" for building complex sentences is brilliant.                     |
| Immersion           | 10/10 | Example of official/bureaucratic language vs spoken style is very practical.              |
| Activities          | 10/10 | Unjumble and Error Correction exercises are challenging but fair.                         |
| Richness            | 10/10 | Connects syntax complexity to "Ukrainian Identity" (architectural structures of thought). |
| Humanity            | 10/10 | Dialogues about "visiting friends" and "summer plans" feel natural.                       |
| LLM Fingerprint     | 10/10 | No issues.                                                                                |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | Accurate after fixes.                                                                     |

## Linguistic Accuracy Issues

- *Fixed:* Vocabulary extraction errors (`вересна` -> `вересень`, proper nouns capitalization).

## Strengths

- **Architecture of Thought:** The module beautifully frames complex syntax not as "hard grammar" but as a tool for building "architectural structures of ideas", comparing Ukrainian richness to English simplicity.
- **Levels of Dependency:** The parsing of 2-level and 3-level dependency chains is logically satisfying.

## Issues

- *Fixed:* Vocab errors.

## Recommendation

✅ PASS — Outstanding synthesis module.

## Action Items

1. Fixed vocabulary extraction errors — ✅ APPLIED
