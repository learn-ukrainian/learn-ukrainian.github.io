## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **IT/Business Focus**: Addressing the huge IT sector ("deploy", "standup") makes this module immediately monetizable/valuable.
2.  **Cultural Insight**: Explaining that "What were you doing?" (IPF) sounds like an accusation of wasting time, whereas "What did you manage to do?" (PF) is the correct professional question.
3.  **Framework**: The Monday-Friday timeline makes the abstract aspect concepts concrete.

### Issues
*   **Duplicate/Placeholder Header**: The file contains:
    ```markdown
    # Вправи
    <!-- Activities loaded from 13-work-week-aspect-in-action.activities.yaml -->
    ```
    This triggers the **Scenario A** flag.

### Specific Content Checks

*   **Grammar**: No issues.
*   **Vocabulary**: "дедлайн", "звіт" correctly included.

## 4. Final Recommendation

**✅ PASS (with Safe Fixes)**

Content is perfect. Remove placeholder section.

### Action Items
1. **Remove Inline Placeholder:** Delete `# Вправи` and the comment block. [SAFE]
