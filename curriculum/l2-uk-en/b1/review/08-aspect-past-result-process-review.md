## Overall Score: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Strengths

### 1. **Cultural DNA (Toloka & Nestor)**
Connecting grammar to *Toloka* (communal work process vs result) and *Nestor regarding History* (chronicling process vs specific events) is genius. This makes the grammar memorable and emotionally resonant.

### 2. **Nuance Handling**
The section on "Duration" is critical. Many learners think "time phrase = Imperfective." This module clarifies:
- *Я писав годину* (Imp - Process)
- *Я написав за годину* (Perf - Result)
This is a common B1 pitfall, effectively addressed.

### 3. **Proverbs**
"Зробив діло — гуляй сміло" (Done the deed, walk boldly) is the perfect mnemonic for the Perfective aspect.

## Analysis by Section

### The Test (Introduction)
**Score: 5/5**. Comparing a "Productive Day" (Perf) to a "Busy Day" (Imp) immediately clarifies the concept.

### Explanation (Markers)
**Score: 5/5**. Clear distinction between *нарешті* (finally/result) and *поки* (while/process).

### Special Cases
**Score: 5/5**. The "Already" (*вже*) distinction is subtle but vital. "I already read it" (Imp - fact) vs "I have already read it" (Perf - result).

### Dialogues
**Score: 5/5**. 6 dialogues covering Work, Study, and Moving contexts. Natural usage of aspect switching.

## Issues Found
*None.*

---

## Pedagogical Analysis
- **Scaffolding:** Moves from the binary concept to the "Duration" trap, which is the hardest part.
- **Cognitive Load:** High, but supported by excellent tables and diagrams.

---

## Vocabulary Analysis
**Count:** 35 terms.
**Quality:** Focuses on "meta-vocabulary" like *result, process, duration, completion, achievement*. This empowers learners to think regarding the grammar itself.

---

## Activity Critique
**Volume:** 12 activities.
**Variety:** Quiz, Match-up, Fill-in, True-False, Group Sort, Unjumble, Error Correction, Cloze, Mark Words, Select, Dialogue Reorder, Translate.
**Quality:** The "Translate" activity specifically targets the English "was doing" vs "did" ambiguity, forcing a choice based on aspect.

## Final Assessment
**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Recommendation:** Proceed. No changes needed.
