## Fixes Applied

1.  **Vocabulary**: Rewrote `vocabulary/03-reading-grammar-rules.yaml` to remove hallucinated entries (e.g., "оки", "да'") and replace them with the actual instruction verbs and analytical terms taught in the module.

## Conclusion

This module is a powerhouse for learner autonomy. By teaching the "language of instructions" and "grammar patterns," it unlocks the entire universe of native Ukrainian resources. The inclusion of register (colloquial vs literary) and analytical terms (context, marker) elevates it beyond simple vocabulary lists.
