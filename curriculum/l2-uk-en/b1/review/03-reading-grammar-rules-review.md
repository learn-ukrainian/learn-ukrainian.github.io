**Checklist:**
- [x] Word count: 2365 words (requirement: 1200+)
- [x] Vocabulary: 40 items in YAML (requirement: 25-45)
- [x] Terminology coverage: All target terms introduced with Ukrainian + English
- [x] Usage examples: Each term shown in context
- [x] Bilingual scaffolding: Tables with Ukrainian terms + English translations
- [x] Activities: 15 activities (requirement: 10-12)
- [x] Engagement boxes: 11 boxes (requirement: 4-5)

5. **Clear bridge function** - Module explicitly prepares learners for M06+ full immersion

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Fixed Issues

1. **mark-the-words activity missing `correct_words` array** - FIXED
   - Added proper `correct_words` array with 7 terms
   - Removed inline `[marked]` syntax from passage

2. **ASCII double quotes throughout module** - FIXED
   - Replaced all `"..."` with Ukrainian angular quotes

3. **Empty "Need More Practice?" section** - FIXED
