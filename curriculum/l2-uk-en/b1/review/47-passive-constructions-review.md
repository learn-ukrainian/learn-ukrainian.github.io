## Linguistic Accuracy Issues

- None.

## Strengths

- **Stylistic Awareness:** The module explicitly warns against overusing passive voice ("канцелярит"), promoting active constructions as the Ukrainian standard. This is crucial for avoiding Russian-style passive-heavy bureaucratese.
- **Contextual Fit:** Using news headlines to demonstrate where passive voice *is* appropriate (e.g., "bridge closed", "law adopted") is excellent pedagogy.

## Issues

- None.

## Recommendation

✅ PASS — Strong module.

## Action Items

1. None.
