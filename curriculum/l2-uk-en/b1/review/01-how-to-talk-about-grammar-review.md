## Strengths

1. **Etymology connections**: Links Ukrainian terms to their roots (дієслово = "діє + слово", іменник from "ім'я") - excellent for retention

2. **Authentic mnemonic**: "На Різдво Дід Загубив Орішки Між Ковбасками" is a genuine Ukrainian school tradition, not fabricated

3. **Case questions table**: Comprehensive reference with all 7 cases, their questions, and examples in one clear table

4. **Mini-dialogues**: Natural classroom and study situations that model how terminology is used in real conversations

5. **Pattern recognition section**: Shows learners how to decode Ukrainian grammar explanations with guided examples

6. **Strong motivational framing**: The "Why This Module Matters" box clearly explains practical value

## Exemplary Passages

### Etymology Explanation (line 73)
> "Notice how each Ukrainian term describes what the word category does. The іменник comes from "ім'я" — it names things. The прикметник comes from "прикмета" — it describes characteristics."

**Why it works:** Natural English with purposeful Ukrainian insertion; etymology aids retention.

### Practical Application (line 98)
> "When a Ukrainian grammar book tells you to put a noun in the родовий відмінок, you need to know exactly which ending patterns to apply."

**Why it works:** Explains the "why" - connects abstract terminology to practical use case.

### Cultural Authenticity (line 238)
> "Є мнемоніка: 'На Різдво Дід Загубив Орішки Між Ковбасками.'"

**Why it works:** Genuine Ukrainian school tradition, not fabricated content.
