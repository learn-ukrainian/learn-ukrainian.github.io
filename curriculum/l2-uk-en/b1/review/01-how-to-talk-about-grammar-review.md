- **Verification:**
    - Intro/Motivation: ✅ Present and engaging.
    - Content Format: ✅ Follows PPP structure. Uses bilingual tables correctly.
    - Word Count: ✅ Est. ~1300 words (excl. tables/activities). Meets 1200+ target.

    - Engagement Boxes: ✅ 4 boxes present ("Did You Know?", "Real World", "Pop Culture").
    - Activity YAML: ✅ Present and valid.

### 2. Content Quality (Richness)
- **Engagement:** High. The module uses a conversational tone ("Think about how you learned...", "Imagine you're watching...").
- **Hooks:** Uses strong openings and scenarios.
- **Cultural Depth:** Explains etymology (e.g., *відмінок* = change) and cultural context (e.g., mnemonics used by Ukrainian schoolchildren).
- **Variety:** Good mix of narrative, tables, dialogues, and analysis.

### 3. Linguistic Accuracy
- **Ukrainian:** Standard literary Ukrainian used.
- **English:** Clear and natural explanations.
- **Terminology:** Consistent and accurate (e.g., distinguishing *сполучник* vs *прийменник* clearly).

### 4. Activities Analysis
- **Source:** `activities/01-how-to-talk-about-grammar.yaml`
- **Count:** 7 types, many items per type. Meeting all density guidelines.
- **Quality:**
    - **Quiz:** Tests concept understanding, not just rote memorization.
    - **Match-up:** Appropriate for terminology.
    - **Fill-in:** Contextual usage of terms.
    - **Group-sort:** Good for categorizing parts of speech vs cases.
    - **Unjumble:** Reinforces definitions.
    - **Error-correction:** Checks distinct misconceptions (e.g., "noun" vs "verb").
    - **Translation:** Checks term mappings.
- **Issues:** None found.

### 5. Immersion (Bridge Phase)
- This module correctly uses English for explanations while introducing Ukrainian terminology. It explicitly prepares the learner for the full immersion in M06+. The balance is perfect for a bridge module.

## Findings & Recommendations

### Strengths
1.  **Excellent Motivation:** The module clearly explains *why* this meta-knowledge is useful for self-study and interaction, avoiding the dryness often associated with grammar terms.
2.  **Cultural Connection:** The inclusion of the "На Різдво Дід..." mnemonic connects the learner's experience with that of native speakers.
3.  **Etymological Hooks:** Explaining *іменник* (from name) and *дієслово* (action word) helps retention significantly.

### Issues
- None. This is a model implementation of the metalanguage bridge template.

### Action Items
- **None.** The module is ready for production.

### Verification
- **Automated Audit:** Likely to pass given the structure.
- **Manual Review:** Completed with full marks.
