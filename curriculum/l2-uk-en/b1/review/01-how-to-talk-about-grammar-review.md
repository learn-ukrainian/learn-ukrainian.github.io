## Strengths

### 1. **Explicit Etymologies**
Explaining the literal meaning of terms (e.g., *іменник* from *ім'я*, *прикметник* from *прикмета*) is a fantastic mnemonic device that transforms abstract terms into logical labels.
> "The іменник comes from "ім'я" — it names things."

### 2. **Practical Mnemonics**
Usage of the culturally authentic mnemonic "На Різдво Дід Загубив Орішки Між Ковбасками" is brilliant. It connects the learner to the shared experience of Ukrainian students.

### 3. **High Activity Volume & Variety**
The YAML file contains 16 distinct activities testing the concepts from multiple angles (identification, matching, definition, ordering). This ensures deep retention of the terminology.

## Analysis by Section

### Presentation (Parts of Speech)
**Score: 5/5**. Clear table, excellent differentiation between content and function words. The "Real World" box about forum discussions validates the learning goal.

### The Seven Cases
**Score: 5/5**. Good tracing of one noun (*сестра*) through all cases. This demonstrates the "why" of cases before asking students to memorize the names.

### Basic Sentence Terms
**Score: 5/5**. Good explanation of *рід, число, особа* with examples showing how they trigger agreements.

### Dialogues
**Score: 5/5**. Meta-dialogues talking *about* grammar using the new terms are very effective for modeling actual usage.
