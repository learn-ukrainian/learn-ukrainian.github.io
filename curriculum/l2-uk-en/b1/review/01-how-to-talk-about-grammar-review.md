| Relevance           | 10/10 | Directly addresses the "metalanguage bridge" goal.                                        |
| Educational         | 10/10 | Mnemonic "На Різдво..." explanation is a great cultural/educational hook.                 |
| Language            | 10/10 | Natural Ukrainian phrasing in dialogues and examples.                                     |
| Pedagogy            | 10/10 | PPP applied effectively for terminology acquisition. Bilingual tables are perfectly used. |

| LLM Fingerprint     | 10/10 | No robotic patterns detected. Content feels bespoke.                                      |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | All definitions correct. Vocabulary file fixed to remove hallucinations.                  |

## Fixes Applied

1.  **Metadata**: Added `Mini-Dialogues` section to `content_outline` in `meta/01-how-to-talk-about-grammar.yaml` to match markdown content.
2.  **Vocabulary**: Completely rewrote `vocabulary/01-how-to-talk-about-grammar.yaml` to remove hallucinated terms (e.g., "д-авальний") and replace them with the actual core terminology taught in the module.

## Conclusion

This module is a perfect example of the B1.0 Metalanguage Bridge. It effectively motivates the learner to acquire grammar terminology not as abstract rules but as practical tools for accessing Ukrainian-only resources. The activities are robust and the cultural notes (mnemonics, school traditions) add significant value.
