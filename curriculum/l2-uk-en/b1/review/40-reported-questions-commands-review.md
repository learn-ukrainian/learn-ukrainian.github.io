## Scores Breakdown

| Dimension           | Score | Notes                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clarity             | 10/10 | Excellent algorithms for forming indirect questions (*чи*) and commands (*щоб* + past). |
| Structure           | 10/10 | Logical separation of Yes/No questions, Wh-questions, and Commands.                     |
| Relevance           | 10/10 | Crucial for "telling stories" about interactions.                                       |
| Language            | 10/10 | Good distinction between *питати* (neutral) and *допитуватися* (insistent).             |
| Pedagogy            | 10/10 | Emphasizes the "Past Tense Rule" for *щоб* commands — a classic stumbling block.        |
| Immersion           | 10/10 | References to "Kyiv journalists" and "Lviv lawyers" contextualize the grammar.          |
| Activities          | 10/10 | High density, good drilling of *чи* and *щоб*.                                          |
| Richness            | 10/10 | *Дерибасівська* example adds local flavor to the concept of "dropped conjunctions".     |
| Humanity            | 10/10 | Dialogues about "job interviews" and "doctor's advice" are very relevant.               |
| LLM Fingerprint     | 10/10 | No issues.                                                                              |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | Accurate after fixes.                                                                   |

## Linguistic Accuracy Issues

- *Fixed:* Vocabulary extraction errors (`Дерибасівська` capitalization, `пересказ` removed, `формулювання` gender).

## Strengths

- **The "Sob" Rule:** The explanation that *щоб* always triggers the past tense in commands (*сказав, щоб ми прийшли*) is presented clearly as an "immutable rule", which is excellent for learners.
- **Word Order:** Explicitly pointing out that indirect questions usually have direct word order is a very helpful tip.

## Issues

- *Fixed:* Vocab errors.

## Recommendation

✅ PASS — Excellent grammar module.

## Action Items

1. Fixed vocabulary extraction errors — ✅ APPLIED
