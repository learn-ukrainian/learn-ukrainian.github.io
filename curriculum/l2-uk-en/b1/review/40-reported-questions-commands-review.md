## 2. Quantitative Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Separates "Questions" (*chy* vs Question Words) and "Commands" (*shchob* + Past) clearly. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Critical for "Interview" (He asked if I have experience) and "Medical" contexts. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | The "Shchob + Past Tense" rule for commands (*Vona skazala, shchob ya pryishov*) is explained perfectly. This is the hardest concept in this module. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Distinguishes between *zapytav* (neutral), *dopytuvavsya* (interrogated), *blahav* (begged). |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | Contrastive analysis: Direct Question (Inversion) vs Indirect Question (Direct Order). |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Kyiv "Verkhovna Rada" context for journalistic questioning is great. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | YAML file present. |
| **Richness** | 5/5 | "Word is not a sparrow" proverb adds cultural depth. |

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Grammar Trap Avoidance**: Emphasizes that Indirect Questions *always* have Direct Order (Subject + Verb), forbidding the inversion common in direct questions.
2.  **Morphology Rule**: The mandatory use of *Past Tense* after *Shchob* in commands (*Shchob ty zrobiv* - literally "That you DID") is highlighted as a key rule.
3.  **Lexical Variety**: Good range of verbs for "Ask" (*pytaty, tsikavytysia, z'yasovuvaty*).

### Issues
*   **None Identified**. Clean content.

### Specific Content Checks

*   **Grammar**: Correct.
