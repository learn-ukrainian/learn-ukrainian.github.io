## 2. Quantitative Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Justification |

| **Coherence** | 5/5 | 1) Explicit comparison of styles (Table: Official vs Colloquial). 2) Scenarios cover all B1.4 grammar topics (Passive, Fractions, Diminutives). |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Teaches "Code-Switching" - vital for modern Ukrainian business/IT culture. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | The "Translation" exercises (Official -> Colloquial and vice versa) are high-value cognitive tasks. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Demonstrates sophisticated usage (*vstanovleno*, *prognozuietsia*) alongside authentic family talk (*synochku*). |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | Does not just teach "rules", but *appropriateness* of rules. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Mentions "IT specialists code-switching" and "News style" (1+1 vs Parliament). |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | YAML file present. No inline activities (Scenario C). |
| **Richness** | 5/5 | The "Grandma Chat" is deeply culturally resonant. |

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Register Awareness**: Most courses ignore this. Here, it is the central theme. Learners see *why* they learned the Passive Voice (for reports) and Diminutives (for intimacy).
2.  **Synthesis**: Seamlessly weaves Numerals/Fractions into the Official Report and Questions/Diminutives into the Family Chat.
3.  **Visuals**: The side-by-side text comparison is very effective.

### Issues
