| LLM Fingerprint     | 10/10 | Custom narratives, no generic AI structure.                                       |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | Aspectual pairs used in examples are semantically correct.                        |

## Fixes Applied

1.  **Metadata**: Corrected `word_target` to `1700` and updated `Підсумок` section in `content_outline` to reach the total sum of 1700, resolving the hydration error.
2.  **Vocabulary**: Rewrote `vocabulary/07-aspect-past-single-repeated.yaml` to focus on the frequency adverbs and primary aspectual pairs used in the module, removing generic filler words.

## Conclusion

This module provides a clear, rule-based approach to a conceptually difficult topic. By focusing on "number of times" as a primary trigger, it gives learners a concrete tool for self-correction in speech and writing. the "Chumaky" cultural anchor is particularly strong.
