## Overall Score: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Strengths

### 1. **Historical Narration (Chumaky)**
Using the history of Chumaky to explain aspect is brilliant.
> "Чумаки... **їздили** (repeated) до Криму... але коли чумак нарешті **повернувся** (one-time result)..."
This embeds grammar into the national DNA.

### 2. **Handling Ambiguity**
The section on *колись* (sometime/once upon a time) is very necessary. Explaining that it can take *either* aspect depending on whether it means "one specific time" or "back in the day (habit)" prevents future confusion.

### 3. **Proverb Integration**
"Краще один раз побачити" is the perfect proverb for this topic. It linguistically reinforces the rule (*побачити* = Perf = one time).

## Analysis by Section

### The Test (Introduction)
**Score: 5/5**. Contrasts two summer stories. One is a list of events (Perf), the other a description of routine (Imp). Very clear.

### Explanation (Markers)
**Score: 5/5**. The table of markers (Once/That time vs Always/Often) is the core reference tool here.

### Contrast Section
**Score: 5/5**. Side-by-side comparison of the same verb in diferent aspects is highly effective teaching.

### Dialogues
**Score: 5/5**. 6 dialogues!? Excellent volume. They cover childhood, travel, work — very useful everyday topics.

## Issues Found
*None.*

---

## Pedagogical Analysis
- **Scaffolding:** Builds from clear markers (always/once) to ambiguous ones (long ago).
- **Cognitive Load:** Manageable. Focus remains tight on Frequency.

---

## Vocabulary Analysis
**Count:** 25 terms.
**Quality:** Mostly frequency adverbs, which are the "keys" to unlocking this grammar rule. Appropriate.

---

## Activity Critique
**Volume:** 10 activities.
**Variety:** Quiz, Match-up, Fill-in, True-False, Group Sort, Unjumble, Error Correction, Cloze, Mark Words, Select, Dialogue Reorder, Translate.
**Quality:** The "Group Sort" (One time vs Repeated) helps solidify the mental categories before asking students to conjugate.

## Final Assessment
**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Recommendation:** Proceed. No changes needed.
