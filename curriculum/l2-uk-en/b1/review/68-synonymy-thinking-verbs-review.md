| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Moving beyond just "dumaty" is crucial for B1 learners to sound educated. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | The nuance explanation (*hadaty* for guessing, *vvazhaty* for believing) is world-class. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Good warnings against Russianisms (*dumaty za*). |
| **Pedagogy** | 4/5 | **Note:** Dictionary table lacks IPA column. Also, ~5 words in table appear for the first time there (not in body). |

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Usage Guides**: The "Situation 1/2/3" guide (Lines 176-200) is incredibly practical. It gives learners a decision tree for which verb to use.
2.  **Common Mistakes**: Explicit warning against *dumaty za* (Russian interference) is very helpful.
3.  **Intellectual Depth**: Using quotes from philosophers to teach "thinking verbs" elevates the module from a word list to a cultural lesson.

### Issues
*   **Missing IPA**: The vocabulary table (Lines 353-380) lacks IPA.
*   **Late Introduction**: Some words (*sumnivatysia, zdogaduvatysia, pomichaty*) appear in the final table but are not explicitly taught in the "Groups" sections.

### Specific Content Checks

*   **Grammar**: Correct.
*   **Vocabulary**: 25 terms in table, 20 in frontmatter. Acceptable.
*   **Formatting**: Clean.

## 4. Final Recommendation

**✅ PASS** (with minor notes)

High-value content for improving learner eloquence.

### Action Items
*   [ ] (Future) Add missing words from table to body sections.
*   [ ] (Future) Add IPA to table.
