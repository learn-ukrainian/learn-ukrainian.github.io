| ------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Coherence           | 10/10 | Logical staging of the three forms. Uses "Observe" boxes to guide discovery.                         |
| Relevance           | 10/10 | Crucial for B1. Covers the unique "-тиму" form which is often missed in basic materials.             |
| Educational         | 10/10 | The distinction between conversational (буду) and formal (-тиму) is clear and practical.             |
| Language            | 10/10 | High-quality Ukrainian. The "History Bite" about the origin of "-тиму" is excellent.                 |
| Pedagogy            | 10/10 | TTT approach is well-integrated with "Intuition check" at the start.                                 |
| Immersion           | 10/10 | 98.6% immersion. Complex grammar explained entirely in Ukrainian.                                    |

| Humanity            | 10/10 | "Myth Buster" box about the legitimacy of the "-тиму" form is a powerful decolonization touch.       |
| LLM Fingerprint     | 10/10 | Authentic structure. No generic "Let's explore" intros.                                              |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | Accurate conjugation tables and aspectual usage across all three forms.                              |

## Fixes Applied

1.  **Metadata**: Synchronized `content_outline` word counts and headers with the actual markdown structure.
2.  **Vocabulary**: Cleaned up `vocabulary/09-aspect-future.yaml` to focus on linguistic markers and future-oriented verbs, removing hallucinated filler nouns.

## Conclusion

This module successfully demystifies the Ukrainian future tense system. By presenting the three forms as "choices for different contexts" rather than "rules to fear," it empowers the learner. The historical and cultural context provided for the synthetic form is a standout feature.
