## Linguistic Accuracy Issues

- None.

## Strengths

- **Narrative Theory:** The module moves beyond sentence-level grammar to paragraph-level "texture" (foreground vs background), which is exactly what B1 learners need.
- **Rhythm Awareness:** Explicitly teaching the "speed" of PF vs "slowness" of IPF helps develop intuition.
- **Conjunction Triggers:** The table mapping specific conjunctions (поки -> НДВ, як тільки -> ДВ) provides concrete anchors for learners.

## Issues

- *Fixed:* Vocabulary extraction errors (`місяців` -> `місяць`, `налив` -> `налити`, `несподіване` -> `несподіваний`).

## Recommendation

✅ PASS — Excellent capstone to the aspect block.

## Action Items

1. Fixed vocabulary extraction errors — ✅ APPLIED
