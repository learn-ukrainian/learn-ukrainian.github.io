## 1. Module Overview

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Template** | `b1-grammar-module-template.md` | ✅ Compliant |
| **Word Count** | >2500 words | ✅ Meets requirements |
| **Vocabulary** | 25 items | ✅ Matches frontmatter |
| **Activities** | DUPLICATE | ⚠️ **Scenario A** (Placeholder `# Вправи` found) |
| **Overall Score** | **5/5** | Excellent integration of advanced concepts. |

## 2. Quantitative Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Explains "temporal connectors" (while, after, as soon as) with perfect clarity. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Narrative aspect switching is the hardest part of Slavic languages; this nails it. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | Algorithm for aspect choice (flowchart style) is very helpful. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Clear examples. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | TTT. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | "Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors" reference (module 12) was good, here we have action vs contemplation scene breakdown. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | YAML valid. |
| **Richness** | 5/5 | "Strategie 1: Chain of PF for Action" is great advice. |

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Narrative Strategy**: Explicitly teaching "Strategy 1: Chain of PF for Action" vs "Strategy 2: Background IPF + Event PF" gives learners a toolkit, not just rules.
2.  **Connector Logic**: The table of connectors (while -> IPF, after -> PF) is a great cheat sheet.
3.  **Real World**: News example ("firefighters were extinguishing (IPF) -> extinguished (PF)") shows media literacy relevance.

### Issues
*   **Duplicate/Placeholder Header**: The file contains:
    ```markdown
    # Вправи
    <!-- Activities loaded from 14-aspect-integration-practice.activities.yaml -->
    ```
    This triggers the **Scenario A** flag.

### Specific Content Checks

*   **Grammar**: No issues.
*   **Vocabulary**: "нарешті", "зрештою" covered.

## 4. Final Recommendation

**✅ PASS (with Safe Fixes)**

Content is perfect. Remove placeholder section.

### Action Items
1. **Remove Inline Placeholder:** Delete `# Вправи` and the comment block. [SAFE]
