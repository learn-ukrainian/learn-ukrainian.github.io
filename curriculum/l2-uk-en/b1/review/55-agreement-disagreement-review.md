## Linguistic Accuracy Issues

- None.

## Strengths

- **Cultural Safety:** The module emphasizes that direct disagreement (`Я не згодна`) can be too harsh, teaching "Yes, but..." structures (`Я розумію вашу думку, але...`) which are vital for Ukrainian politeness strategies.
- **Scenario:** The Talk Show context allows for dramatic, exaggerated opinions which are perfect for practicing agreement/disagreement.

## Issues

- None.

## Recommendation

✅ PASS — Excellent pragmatic competence module.

## Action Items

1. None.
