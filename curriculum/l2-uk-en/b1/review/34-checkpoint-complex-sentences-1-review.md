## 2. Quantitative Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Segments the 3 major skills (Relative, Purpose, Conditional) logically. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Checkpoint format is crucial for consolidating complex grammar before moving on. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | "Integration Challenge" (Find 2 relative, 2 purpose, etc.) encourages active analysis of text. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Self-Check lists are very specific ("Did I use the correct case for *yakyi*?"). |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | Writing task with constraint (Use 2 of each type) is excellent scaffolding. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Text about traveling to Japan (M30 context) and Lviv (cultural context) connects the themes. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | YAML file present. |
| **Richness** | 5/5 | Note on "Cognitive abilities correlating with subordinate clause usage" is a motivating intellectual nugget. |

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Integration**: The "Integration Challenge" text is dense with target grammar but reads naturally. It proves these structures coexist in real speech.
2.  **Writing Prompt**: The constraints (2 relative, 2 purpose, 2 conditional) force the learner to "synthesize" rather than just fill blanks.
3.  **Vocabulary Review**: The consolidated table of connectors (*yakyi, de, kudy, shchob, yakshcho, yakby*) is a great reference.

### Issues
*   **None Identified**. Clean content.

### Specific Content Checks

*   **Grammar**: Correct.
*   **Vocabulary**: 35 items (Review focus).
*   **Formatting**: Clean.
