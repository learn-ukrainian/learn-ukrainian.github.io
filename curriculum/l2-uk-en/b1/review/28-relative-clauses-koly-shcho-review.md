## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Metalinguistic Clarity**: The distinction between *Shcho*-relative (has antecedent) and *Shcho*-conjunction (no antecedent) is often skipped in textbooks, but vital here.
2.  **Phraseology**: Teaching the chunk "Te, shcho..." as a unit is very effective for learners.
3.  **Literary Context**: Using Shevchenko to teach grammar is the definition of "Richness".

### Issues
