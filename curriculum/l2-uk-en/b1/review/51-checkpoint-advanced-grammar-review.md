## Linguistic Accuracy Issues

- None.

## Strengths

- **Register Contrast:** The module masterfully tests the learner's ability to switch between "official" (participles/passive) and "private" (diminutives) registers, which is the core goal of B1.4.
- **Narrative Practice:** The art exhibition story allows learners to use _all_ the new tools in a single context: reading the _written_ catalogue (passive) and speaking to the _human_ seller (diminutives).

## Issues

- None.

## Recommendation

✅ PASS — Excellent checkpoint.

## Action Items

1. None.
