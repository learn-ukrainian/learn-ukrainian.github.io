## 1. Module Overview

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Template** | `b1-grammar-module-template.md` | ✅ Compliant |
| **Word Count** | ~2800 words | ✅ Meets requirements |
| **Vocabulary** | 25 items | ✅ Matches frontmatter |
| **Activities** | YAML | ✅ Found `30-purpose-shchob-past-form.yaml` |
| **Overall Score** | **5/5** | Excellent handling of Subjunctive/Purpose logic. |

## 2. Quantitative Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Contrasts "Same Subject" (M29) vs "Different Subject" (M30) clearly. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Necessary for polite requests ("I want you to...") and commands. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | Explains *why* we use "past form" (Subjunctive) for non-past events. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Wide range of verbs (demand, ask, advise, forbid). |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | "Subject Agreement" table (Vin -v, Vona -la) is essential for this topic. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | "Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors" quote again — consistent cultural thread. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | YAML file present. |
| **Richness** | 5/5 | Ostroh Academy history bite regarding "demanding students learn Latin" fits perfectly. |

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Logical Flow**: The module explicitly builds on M29. The flow chart (Same Subject? -> Inf; Diff Subject? -> Past) is implied and effectively taught.
2.  **Gamer Context**: The Witcher 3 example ("I want you to find my daughter") resonates well with the target demographic.
3.  **Verb Variety**: It doesn't just stick to "want"; it covers "demand", "advise", "forbid", making it a massive vocabulary booster.

### Issues
*   **None Identified**. Placeholder removed.

### Specific Content Checks

*   **Grammar**: Correct explanation of Ukrainian Subjunctive (Past form used for desire).
*   **Vocabulary**: 25 verb-focused items.
*   **Formatting**: Clean.

## 4. Final Recommendation

**✅ PASS**

No further changes required.

### Action Items
None.
