## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Conceptual Depth**: The explanation of *Embodiment* (we understand abstract concepts through physical motion) is sophisticated and helps learners understand not just *what* to say, but *why* it is said that way.
2.  **Cultural Relevance**: The "History Bite" connecting "Перейти в наступ" (Go on the offensive) to the Executed Renaissance is a brilliant touch of decolonization.
3.  **Practicality**: The list of idioms is highly curated (high-frequency only).

### Issues
*   **None Identified**. The module appears clean. Placeholder activity section is absent (Scenario A resolved).

### Specific Content Checks

*   **Grammar**: Correct.
*   **Vocabulary**: 25 items, well-chosen idioms.
*   **Formatting**: Standard MarkDown headers and callouts used correctly.

## 4. Final Recommendation

**✅ PASS**

No further changes required.

### Action Items
None.
