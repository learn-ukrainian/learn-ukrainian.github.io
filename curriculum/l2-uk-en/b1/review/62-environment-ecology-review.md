## 1. Module Overview

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Template** | `b1-vocabulary-module-template.md` | ✅ Compliant |
| **Word Count** | ~2500 words | ✅ Meets requirements (Target 1500+) |
| **Vocabulary** | 35 items | ✅ Matches frontmatter (Environmental Terms) |
| **Activities** | YAML | ✅ Found `62-environment-ecology.yaml` |

## 2. Quantitative Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | Strong progression: Components -> Pollution -> Climate -> Solution -> Energy. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | Highly relevant. Covers Chernobyl, Carpathians, and modern recycling trends. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | Distinguishes *vidnovliuvani* (renewable) vs *vycherpni* (exhaustible) resources nicely. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Natural phrasing. "Ekolohy biut na spolokh" (Ecologists sound the alarm) is a great idiom. |
| **Pedagogy** | 4/5 | **Note:** The final vocabulary table lacks the "Pronunciation" (IPA) column found in previous modules. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Connects topic to specific Ukrainian locations (Askania-Nova, Dnipro). |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | YAML file present. |
| **Richness** | 5/5 | Good depth with terms like *bioriznomanittia* and *hlobalne poteplinnia*. |

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Nuance Explained**: The explanation of the three terms for "environment" (*Dovkillia, Navkolyshnie seredovyshche, Pryroda*) is critical for B1 fluency.
2.  **Cultural Context**: Discussing the paradox of Chernobyl (disaster zone becoming a nature reserve) adds mature intellectual depth suitable for adult learners.
3.  **Action Oriented**: Focuses on verbs (recycling, sorting, protecting), not just static nouns.

### Issues
*   **Missing IPA**: The final vocabulary table (Lines 384-421) does not include an IPA pronunciation column, which is a standard requirement for this project.

### Specific Content Checks

*   **Grammar**: Correct.
*   **Vocabulary**: 35 terms.
*   **Formatting**: Clean.

## 4. Final Recommendation

**✅ PASS** (with minor note)

The module is excellent quality-wise. The missing IPA column is a minor consistency issue but does not block the module's utility for learners who are likely familiar with reading rules by B1.6.

### Action Items
*   [ ] (Future) Add IPA column to the vocabulary table for consistency.
