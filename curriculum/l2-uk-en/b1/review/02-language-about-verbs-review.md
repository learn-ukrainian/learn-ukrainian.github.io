## Fixes Applied

1.  **Metadata**: Added `Mini-Dialogues` and `Practice Reading Grammar Explanations` to `content_outline` in `meta/02-language-about-verbs.yaml`.
2.  **Vocabulary**: Completely rewrote `vocabulary/02-language-about-verbs.yaml` to remove hallucinated terms and replace them with correct terminology (вид, час, спосіб, etc.).
3.  **Markdown**:
    - Renamed section headers to match English outline (`## Practice Reading Grammar Explanations`, `## Mini-Dialogues`).
    - Removed empty `## Пояснення` header.
    - Expanded `Tense Terms` section with "Tense and Aspect Interaction" subsection to meet word count and add pedagogical value.
    - Expanded `Mini-Dialogues` with "Dialog 5" to meet word count.

## Conclusion

This module successfully bridges the gap between English-concept understanding and Ukrainian-terminology application for verbs. The addition of the "S.T.A.L.K.E.R." reference makes it culturally relevant and memorable. The explanation of why perfective verbs have no present tense is a critical addition that will prevent future errors.
