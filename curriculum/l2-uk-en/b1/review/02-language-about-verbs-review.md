## Scores Breakdown

| Criterion | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | clear separation of Aspect vs Tense, then integration. |
| **Relevance** | 5/5 | "Vid" (Aspect) is the most critical concept to formalize at B1. |
| **Educational** | 5/5 | Great use of "view" etymology for *вид*. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. example is a brilliant cultural hook. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Precise terminology; clear definitions. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | Scaffolding from basic binary choice (perf/imp) to complex formation rules. |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Contextual examples clarify abstract concepts. |
| **Activity Quality** | 5/5 | 12 distinct activity types. "Group Sort" is particularly effective for classifying aspect functions. |
| **Word Salad** | ✅ NO | High density of useful information. |
| **Red Flags** | ✅ NONE | Clean module. |

## Strengths

### 1. **Cultural Connectors (Pop Culture)**
Using the video game S.T.A.L.K.E.R. to explain aspect ("mission complete" vs "ongoing task") is a masterstroke. It makes an abstract linguistic concept concrete and "cool".
> "In Ukrainian game localizations, aspect creates nuance. 'Ти вбив дракона' (perfective) means 'You killed the dragon' — mission complete."

### 2. **Practical Abbreviations**
Explicitly teaching *ДВ* and *НДВ* prepares learners for using real dictionaries and online forums independently. This is true learner empowerment.

### 3. **Concept-Based Definitions**
The module defines terms by their *function* (process vs result) rather than just translation. This prevents the common error of equation aspect directly to English tenses.

## Analysis by Section

### The Two Key Concepts
**Score: 5/5**. Immediate distinction between Time (Tense) and View (Aspect). The "View" analogy is very helpful.

### The Aspect Terms
**Score: 5/5**. The table contrasting functions (Process/Result, Duration/Completion) is excellent reference material.

### Negation Terminology
**Score: 5/5**. Crucial niche topic. Explaining why "ще не" triggers perfective vs "ніколи не" triggers imperfective is high-value content.

### Understanding Aspect Pairs
**Score: 5/5**. Good overview of the three formation methods (prefix, suffix, root change), setting up future modules.

## Issues Found
*None.*

---

## Pedagogical Analysis
- **Scaffolding:** Introduces the *concept* of aspect pairs before diving into the complex morphology in later modules.
- **Cognitive Load:** Heavy conceptual load, but broken down well into "What is it?" -> "What does it do?" -> "What is it called?".

---

## Vocabulary Analysis
**Count:** 34 terms.
**Quality:** Comprehensive list of verb metalanguage. Includes critical terms like *дієвідміна* and *інфінітив*.

---

## Activity Critique
**Volume:** 12 activity types.
**Variety:** Excellent mix of recognition (Quiz, Select) and production (Fill-in, Translate).
**Quality:** The "Group Sort" activity categorizing functions (e.g., "repetition" -> Imperfective) is exactly the kind of deep processing needed for this topic.

## Final Assessment
**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Recommendation:** Proceed. No changes needed.
