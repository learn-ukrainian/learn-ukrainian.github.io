## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Myth Busting**: The section debunking the "Participles are archaic" myth is excellent and aligned with the "Decolonization" skill.
2.  **Subject Agreement**: The warning about "reading the book, it became boring to me" (incorrect Ukrainian/English structure) is vital.
3.  **Reflexive Rule**: Explicitly teaching that *-sia* becomes *-s'* always in participles is a great detail.
