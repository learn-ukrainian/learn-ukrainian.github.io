## 2. Quantitative Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Coherence** | 5/5 | 1) Contrast with M42 (Simultaneous), 2) Concept (Prior Action), 3) Formation (-vshy/-shy), 4) Special forms (pryishovshy). |

| **Educational** | 5/5 | The "Time Line" visualization (--> = --> vs --> -->) is a great pedagogical tool. |
| **Language** | 5/5 | Comparison tables between Imperfective and Perfective are very helpful. |
| **Pedagogy** | 5/5 | Explicitly addressing the "Russian vs Ukrainian" usage frequency (Ukrainian retains these forms more). |
| **Immersion** | 5/5 | Lesya Ukrainka example adds literary weight. |
| **Activities** | 5/5 | YAML file present. No inline activities (Scenario C). |
| **Richness** | 5/5 | Historical note on the archaic nature of these forms preserved in Ukrainian is fascinating. |

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Direct Contrast**: The module starts by immediately contrasting with M42, which is excellent for retention.
2.  **Phonetic Detail**: Explains the *-ovshy* suffix for stems ending in consonants (*pryity -> pryishovshy*), a common stumbling block.
3.  **Style Guide**: Breakdown of how these are used in Legal vs Journalistic vs Artistic styles is very useful for B1+ learners.
