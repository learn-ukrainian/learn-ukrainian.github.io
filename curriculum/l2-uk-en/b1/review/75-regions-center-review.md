## Linguistic Accuracy Issues

- **Vocabulary:** `волити` (to wish/prefer). Archaic/poetic. Standard is `хотіти`, `бажати`. Is this intended for the literary context (Shevchenko)?
  - _Investigation:_ Acceptable in context of 19th-century literature.
- **Vocabulary:** Capitalization issues (`канів`, `черкас`, `гоголь`, `диканька`).
- **Vocabulary:** `Черкас` is listed as singular. Usually referred to as _Черкаси_ (plural name). `Черкас` would be the genitive plural or a singular archaic demonym (a Circassian).
  - _Action:_ Change to `Черкаси`.

## Strengths

- **Language History:** Explains that modern standard Ukrainian is based on the dialects of Poltava/Cherkasy (`Котляревський`), which gives students confidence that they are learning the "central" standard.
- **Cossack Roots:** Connecting "democracy" to the "Sich" reinforces the political vocabulary from M60.

## Issues

- **Vocabulary YAML:** Capitalize proper nouns. `Черкас` -> `Черкаси`.

## Recommendation

✅ PASS — Excellent geography/history module.

## Action Items

1. **Fix Vocab:** Capitalize proper nouns. Fix `Черкаси`.
