## 3. Detailed Analysis

### Strengths
1.  **Gaming Culture**: The specific mention of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. creates an immediate bond with a specific segment of learners (gamers/tech), which is likely a high percentage of the demographics.
2.  **Emotional Granularity**: Moving beyond "sad" to "grief", "sorrow", "despair" is exactly what B1 students need to stop sounding like children.
3.  **Literature Connection**: Mentioning Shevchenko and Lesya Ukrainka cements the cultural weight of these words.

### Issues

### Specific Content Checks

*   **Grammar**: Correct.
*   **Vocabulary**: 35 terms.
*   **Formatting**: Clean.

## 4. Final Recommendation

**✅ PASS** (with minor note)

Outstanding content. The cultural integration is top-tier.

### Action Items
