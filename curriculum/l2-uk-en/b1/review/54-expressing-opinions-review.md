## Linguistic Accuracy Issues

- None.

## Strengths

- **Nuance:** It doesn't just list phrases but categorizes them by *certainty*. Teaching `мені здається` (low certainty) vs `я переконаний` (high certainty) prevents students from sounding incorrectly arrogant or unsure.

## Issues

- None.

## Recommendation

✅ PASS — Excellent communication module.
