# Пасивні дієприкметники минулого часу II

> 🎯 **Чому це важливо**
>
> «Написано», «зроблено», «сказано» — короткі форми використовуються як присудки. «Все сказано» — лаконічно, потужно. Це мова оголошень, висновків і рішучих заяв.

## Діагностика

Read these two versions of the same announcements. What's different?

> **Version A (Full forms):**
> Книга **написана**. Двері **закриті**. Завдання **виконане**.

> **Version B (Short forms):**
> Книгу **написано**. Двері **закрито**. Завдання **виконано**.

**Questions:**
1. What happened to the ending in Version B?
2. What happened to the case of the object (книга → книгу)?
3. Which version sounds more impersonal/official?

> 💡 **Pattern Discovery**
> Short forms ending in **-но/-то** create **impersonal passive constructions**. They don't agree with the noun (no gender/number) — the noun moves to Accusative case, and the verb form is universal.

## Аналіз

### Full vs. Short Passive Forms

| Feature | Full Form (-ний/-тий) | Short Form (-но/-то) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Agreement | Gender, number, case | **No agreement** |
| Subject case | Nominative | **Accusative** |
| Focus | The object | **The action** |
| Style | All contexts | **Formal/official** |

**Compare:**

| Full Form | Short Form |
|-----------|------------|
| Книга **написана** автором. | Книгу **написано** автором. |
| *(The book was written by the author.)* | *(The book was written by the author.)* |
| Двері **закриті**. | Двері **закрито**. |
| *(The doors are closed.)* | *(The doors are closed.)* |

> 🔗 **Language Link: Why Two Forms?**
> 
> English has only one passive: "The book was written."
> 
> Ukrainian has TWO:
> 1. **Full form** (with agreement): focuses on the STATE of the object
> 2. **Short form** (no agreement): focuses on the ACTION that happened
> 
> The short form is more abstract and impersonal — common in news, laws, and official documents.

## Поглиблення

### When to Use Short Forms

| Context | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Official documents** | Законом передбачено... *(The law provides...)* |
| **News reports** | Повідомлено, що... *(It was reported that...)* |
| **Signs and notices** | Вхід заборонено. *(Entry forbidden.)* |
| **Scientific writing** | Доведено, що... *(It has been proven that...)* |
| **Announcements** | Захід скасовано. *(The event has been cancelled.)* |

> 📚 **Historical Note: A Truly Ukrainian Construction**
> 
> The **-но/-то** impersonal passive is a distinctive feature of Ukrainian (and Polish). Russian traditionally lacked this form and often used different constructions. During Russification, Soviet editors sometimes "corrected" Ukrainian texts by replacing natural **-но/-то** forms with Russian-style constructions. Using these forms correctly is part of authentic Ukrainian expression.

---

### Past, Present, and Future

Short forms can combine with **було** and **буде**:

| Tense | Example | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Past (було)** | Це **було вирішено** вчора. | This was decided yesterday. |
| **Present** | Це **вирішено**. | This is decided. |
| **Future (буде)** | Це **буде вирішено** завтра. | This will be decided tomorrow. |

**More examples:**

- Мені **було сказано**, що... *(I was told that...)*
- Йому **буде надіслано** листа. *(He will be sent a letter.)*
- Нам **було дозволено** увійти. *(We were allowed to enter.)*

---

### Agent Expression

The agent (who did the action) uses **Instrumental case** — same as with full forms:

| Short Form | With Agent |
|------------|------------|
| Книгу написано. | Книгу написано **автором**. |
| Рішення прийнято. | Рішення прийнято **урядом**. |
| Закон прийнято. | Закон прийнято **парламентом**. |

---

### Common Phrases and Idioms

Many common Ukrainian expressions use short passive forms:

| Expression | Meaning | Usage |
|------------|---------|-------|
| **Мені сказано** | I was told | Мені сказано чекати. |
| **Як сказано** | As it is said | Як сказано в книзі... |
| **Заборонено** | (It is) forbidden | Заборонено палити. |
| **Дозволено** | (It is) permitted | Вхід дозволено. |
| **Рекомендовано** | (It is) recommended | Рекомендовано лікарем. |
| **Необхідно** | (It is) necessary | Необхідно зробити. |
| **Потрібно** | (It is) needed | Потрібно прийти вчасно. |
| **Важливо** | (It is) important | Важливо пам'ятати. |

> 🎬 **Cinema Corner: Official Announcements**
> 
> In Ukrainian films set in official contexts, you'll hear:
> - *Вас викликано до кабінету директора.* (You have been summoned to the director's office.)
> - *Засідання відкрито.* (The session is open.)
> - *Зустріч скасовано.* (The meeting is cancelled.)

---

### Full vs. Short: Nuance

| Full Form | Short Form | Nuance |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Книга написана. | Книгу написано. | Full = describes book's state; Short = reports the action |
| Двері закриті. | Двері закрито. | Full = doors are in closed state; Short = someone closed them |
| Завдання виконане. | Завдання виконано. | Full = task is complete; Short = task was completed (action focus) |

**In casual speech:** Full forms are more common.
**In formal/official writing:** Short forms dominate.

## Deeper Look: The Passive Voice of Manipulation

Language is power. In the 20th century, the impersonal passive voice was often used to erase history.

### The "No One" Myth
Soviet historiography loved the impersonal construction for tragedies.
- *Голод стався.* (The famine happened.)
- *Помилки було допущено.* (Mistakes were allowed to happen.)
- *Людей було виселено.* (People were deported.)

By using **-но/-то** forms without an agent, the regime acted as if these events were natural disasters, not crimes.
**Modern Ukrainian Strategy:** Reclaim agency!
- *Сталін організував Голодомор.* (Stalin organized the Holodomor.) - **Active.**
- *Росія депортувала людей.* (Russia deported people.) - **Active.**

Use the impersonal form for *laws and rules* (Заборонено), but be careful using it for *history*.

---

## Stylistic Nuance: Bureaucracy vs. Life

### The "Kancelaryt" (Bureaucratese)
Ukrainian has a specific term for overuse of official language: **канцелярит**.
It is characterized by heavy use of verbal nouns and, yes, short passive forms.

**Bad Style (Kancelaryt):**
*Мною було прийнято рішення про здійснення покупки хліба.*
(By me was made a decision about the execution of the purchase of bread.)

**Good Style (Living Language):**
*Я вирішив купити хліб.*
(I decided to buy bread.)

The short form **-но/-то** is perfect for **documents**, but deadly for **conversation**.

---

## Poetry of the Short Form

Despite its official nature, the short form can be poetic because it sounds *eternal*.
Lina Kostenko uses it to sound like a verdict of fate:
> *"Життя іде, і все без коректур. І час летить, не стишує галопу. Давно намислено: митці — це не натур..."*

And in ancient chronicles:
> *"Місто спалено. Людей вбито."*
(The city burnt. People killed.)
The shortness implies a terrible finality.

---

### Literary Corner: Lina Kostenko's Verdict

Lina Kostenko, the distinctive voice of the 60s generation (Shistdesiatnyky), uses short forms to create a sense of absolute, unchangeable truth.

> *"Життя іде, і все без коректур."* (Life goes on, and everything is without corrections.)
> *"Давно намислено: митці — це не натур..."*

Here, **намислено** (it is thought/conceived) sounds like a divine decree. If she said *Я намислила* (I conceived), it would be an opinion. *Намислено* makes it a universal law.

This is the power of the impersonal. It removes the ego and leaves only the Truth.

---

### Mock Document: A Protocol

Let's look at a typical **Протокол** (Minutes of Meeting) structure.

**ПРОТОКОЛ № 5**
зборів студентів
**СЛУХАЛИ:** Іваненка П. про організацію свята.
**ВИСТУПИЛИ:** Петренко О., Сидоренко М.
**УХВАЛИЛИ:**
1. Свято **провести** 20 жовтня. (Infinitive)
2. Відповідальним **призначено** Петренка О. (Short Passive)
3. Кошторис **затверджено**. (Short Passive)

Note: The *decision* (Ухвалили) triggers the short forms. Once recorded, it is set in stone.

## Практика

### Dialogue: News Report

> **Диктор:** Сьогодні парламентом прийнято новий закон.
> *(Today a new law was passed by parliament.)*
> 
> **Кореспондент:** Яким законом передбачено зміни?
> *(What changes are provided for by the law?)*
> 

## Deeper Look: The Executed Renaissance

In the 1920s, Ukrainian literature flourished. Then came the 1930s.
*Багато поетів було заарештовано. Багато книг було знищено.*
(Many poets were arrested. Many books were destroyed.)

We often use the **impersonal passive** (-но/-то) to describe this era because the scale of the tragedy feels like a force of nature. But remember: behind every "знищено" (destroyed) there was an active "знищив" (destroyed).

Who destroyed them? The Soviet regime.
While the passive voice captures the *state* of loss, we must not let it hide the *crime*.

## Detailed Analysis: Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using Short Forms with Gender
❌ *Книгу написана.* (Wrong! Object Accusative + Full Participle is mismatched).
✅ *Книга написана.* (Full: Book (Nom) is written).
✅ *Книгу написано.* (Short: Book (Acc) was written).

### Mistake 2: Forgetting the Agent Case
❌ *Зроблено я.* (Wrong! "I" cannot be the agent in Nominative).
✅ *Зроблено мною.* (Right! Instrumental).

### Mistake 3: Wrong Stress
In short forms, stress often shifts to the first syllable of the ending or stays on the stem.
- *Писати -> напИсано*.
- *Робити -> зрОблено*.

---

## Dialogue Analysis: "The Cancellation"

Read this dialogue again from the perspective of **power dynamics**.
> **Secretary:** *Зустріч скасовано.* (Meeting cancelled).
She doesn't say "The Director cancelled the meeting." She hides the boss behind the grammar. The decision sounds final, unarguable.
This is why bureaucrats love this form. It removes the person from the equation.

---
> 
> **Кореспондент:** Коли буде опубліковано текст закону?
> *(When will the text of the law be published?)*
> 
> **Диктор:** Його буде надруковано вже завтра.
> *(It will be printed tomorrow.)*

---

### Dialogue: At the Office

> **Секретар:** Вибачте, вхід до кабінету заборонено.
> *(Sorry, entry to the office is forbidden.)*
> 
> **Відвідувач:** Чому? Мені було сказано прийти о десятій.
> *(Why? I was told to come at ten.)*
> 
> **Секретар:** Зустріч скасовано. Вас буде сповіщено про нову дату.
> *(The meeting has been cancelled. You will be notified about the new date.)*
> 
> **Відвідувач:** Добре. Коли приблизно?
> *(Okay. Approximately when?)*
> 
> **Секретар:** Це ще не вирішено.
> *(That hasn't been decided yet.)*

---

### Legal Protocol: The Language of Rules

Official "Protocols" (Протоколи) live and die by short forms.

**Common Protocol Phrases:**
- **Слухали:** (Heard) - Active, plural. Who spoke? The group.
- **Виступили:** (Speeches by) - Active, plural.
- **Вирішили:** (Decided) - Active.
- **Ухвалено:** (Resolved/Adopted) - **Short Passive**. This is the final verdict.

Notice the progression. The discussion is active (*We heard, we spoke*), but the decision becomes impersonal (*It is resolved*). Once it is **ухвалено**, it is law.

---

### Signs You Will See

| Sign | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **ВХІД ЗАБОРОНЕНО** | Entry Forbidden |
| **ВІДЧИНЕНО** | Open (Shop/Door) |
| **ЗАЧИНЕНО** | Closed (Shop/Door) |
| **ОБІДНЯ ПЕРЕРВА** | Lunch Break (Implied: Закрито) |
| **ПРИЙОМ ЗАПИСІВ ПРИПИНЕНО** | Admission Stopped |
| **ВЕДЕТЬСЯ ВІДЕОСПОСТЕРЕЖЕННЯ** | Video Surveillance in Progress (Reflexive, not short form, but related impersonal vibe) |

---

### Common Style Mistakes

- **Mistake:** *Мною було зроблено...* (By me was done...)
  - **Right:** *Я зробив...* (I did...)
  - **Reason:** Don't use bureaucratic passive in personal stories unless you want to sound like a robot or a politician trying to hide something.

- **Mistake:** *Двері закриті.* (The doors description)
  - **Right:** *Двері закрито.* (The doors action - on a sign)
  - **Reason:** Use short forms for commands/signs. "Закриті" means they are simply in the closed position. "Закрито" means "We are closed" (business status).

- **Mistake:** *Мене було сказано...* (Accusative)
  - **Right:** *Мені було сказано...* (Dative)
  - **Reason:** Passive construction + Dative = "to me it was said".

> **Proverb:** *Слово не горобець, вилетить — не спіймаєш.* (A word is not a sparrow, if it flies out — you won't catch it).
> Be careful with what is *said* (сказано) and *written* (написано).

> **Reminder:** Short forms are powerful precisely because they are short. Don't clutter them!

# Підсумок

У цьому модулі ви опанували **короткі пасивні форми** (-но/-то) — інструмент офіційного та безособового мовлення, що домінує в українському діловодстві.

**Remember:**
- **Formation:** Full (-ий) → Short (-о): написаний → написано
- **No agreement:** Short forms never change
- **Object case:** Moves to Accusative (Книгу написано)
- **Tense:** Add було or буде
- **Common contexts:** News, laws, signs, announcements

Together with full forms (M39), you now have the complete passive participle system!
