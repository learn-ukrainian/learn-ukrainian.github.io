# Вид дієслова — Повна система

> 🎯 **Чому це важливо**
>
> Вид дієслова — це найважливіша граматична категорія в українській мові. Носії мови одразу помічають неправильний вибір виду. Оволодіння цією системою — це те, що відрізняє "підручникову українську" від природного мовлення. Ваша здатність спілкуватися як носій починається тут.

## Diagnostic

Уявіть: ви в кав'ярні у Львові. Офіціант питає вашого друга:

— Що ви **робили** вчора ввечері?
— Я **читав** книгу. Дуже цікава!
— А ви її **прочитали**?
— Так, **прочитав**! До третьої ночі.

Why did the friend use **читав** first but then switch to **прочитав**? Both translate as "read" in English, but they express fundamentally different ideas. This is **вид** (aspect) — and at B1, you're ready to master it completely.

> [!observe] Подивіться на ці пари речень:
> - Він **писав** листа годину. (процес, тривалість)
> - Він **написав** листа. (завершена дія, результат)
> - Вона **готувала** вечерю. (процес)
> - Вона **приготувала** вечерю. (завершена дія)
>
> Яку закономірність ви бачите? Чим відрізняються форми дієслів?

Before we dive into the theory, let's test your intuitions. Read these situations and choose which verb feels right:

**Ситуація 1:** Your colleague asks what you did yesterday evening.
- Я вчора ввечері ___ (читав / прочитав) книгу.

**Ситуація 2:** Your boss asks if the report is ready.
- Так, я вже ___ (писав / написав) звіт.

**Ситуація 3:** You want to explain that you spent your childhood doing something regularly.
- У дитинстві я часто ___ (малював / намалював) картини.

Don't worry if you're unsure — by the end of this module, these choices will feel natural.

## Analysis

### Два світи української дієслівної системи

Ukrainian verbs exist in pairs. Almost every action can be expressed two ways — one emphasizing the **process**, the other emphasizing the **result**:

| Недоконаний вид | Доконаний вид | Значення |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|---------|
| читати | прочитати | read |
| писати | написати | write |
| робити | зробити | do/make |
| говорити | сказати | speak/say |
| дивитися | подивитися | watch/look |
| вчити | вивчити | study/learn |

> 🔗 **Why Aspect Exists**
>
> English speakers often ask: "Why does Ukrainian need this?" The answer lies in what Slavic languages consider important about actions.
>
> English focuses on **when** something happened (past, present, future). Ukrainian cares equally about **how** it happened — was it a completed whole with a result, or an ongoing process?
>
> Think of it like photography: **недоконаний is a video** (ongoing, showing duration), while **доконаний is a photograph** (capturing a completed moment with its result).

**How English Handles Aspect Differently**

English doesn't have grammatical aspect in the Ukrainian sense, but it has related concepts. Consider how English distinguishes these situations:

| English | Ukrainian | Aspect | What's happening |
|---------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| I **was reading** — progressive | Я **читав** | Imperfective | Ongoing action |
| I **have read** — perfect | Я **прочитав** | Perfective | Completed with result |
| I **read** every day | Я **читав** щодня | Imperfective | Habitual action |
| I **read** the book | Я **прочитав** книгу | Perfective | Single completed event |

Notice how English uses the same verb form "read" for the last two examples, relying on context (every day vs. the book) to distinguish habitual from single completed actions. Ukrainian encodes this distinction in the verb itself — you physically cannot use прочитав for habitual actions.

**The Fundamental Shift in Thinking**

When English speakers learn Ukrainian aspect, the biggest shift is moving from temporal thinking (when did it happen?) to perspective thinking (how do I view this action?).

Consider "I read the book yesterday":
- If you want to say you spent time reading: Я **читав** книгу вчора. (Process — you engaged in reading)
- If you want to say you finished it: Я **прочитав** книгу вчора. (Result — the book is now read)

Both happened yesterday. The tense is the same. But the aspect — how you conceptualize the action — determines which verb you choose.

### Недоконаний вид — Процес, тривалість, повторюваність

The imperfective aspect views an action from the inside. You're interested in the **process**, the **duration**, or the **repetition** — not the endpoint.

**Коли використовувати недоконаний:**

1. **Тривала дія:** The action stretched over time.
   - Я **читав** цю книгу три тижні. (I was reading this book for three weeks.)
   - Вона **працювала** в офісі весь день. (She was working in the office all day.)
   - Ми **чекали** на автобус годину. (We were waiting for the bus for an hour.)

2. **Повторювана дія:** The action happened multiple times.
   - Він **ходив** у спортзал щодня. (He went to the gym every day.)
   - Вони **дзвонили** мені кожного ранку. (They called me every morning.)
   - Я завжди **снідав** о восьмій. (I always had breakfast at eight.)

3. **Загальне твердження:** You're stating a fact without focusing on any specific instance.
   - Ти коли-небудь **читав** Шевченка? (Have you ever read Shevchenko?)
   - Він ніколи не **курив**. (He never smoked.)
   - У дитинстві я часто **хворів**. (As a child, I was often sick.)

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> The word "недоконаний" literally means "not finished/completed." It comes from "доконати" (to finish/complete). This etymology reveals the core meaning: imperfective verbs present actions that are viewed without reference to their completion.

### Доконаний вид — Результат, одноразовість, завершеність

The perfective aspect views an action from the outside as a completed whole. You're interested in the **result**, the **single occurrence**, or that the action has **boundaries** (beginning and end).

**Коли використовувати доконаний:**

1. **Завершена дія з результатом:** Completed action with result.
   - Я **прочитав** цю книгу. (I read/finished this book.)
   - Вона **написала** листа. (She wrote the letter — it's done.)
   - Він **зробив** домашнє завдання. (He did/completed the homework.)

2. **Одноразова дія:** Single occurrence.
   - Він **увійшов** до кімнати. (He entered the room — once.)
   - Телефон **задзвонив**. (The phone rang.)
   - Вона **посміхнулася**. (She smiled — one specific smile.)

3. **Початок дії:** Beginning of action.
   - Діти **заспівали** пісню. (The children started singing.)
   - Він **заговорив** українською. (He began speaking Ukrainian.)
   - Вітер **засвистів**. (The wind began to whistle.)

4. **Послідовність завершених дій:** Sequence of completed actions.
   - Він **прийшов** додому, **повечеряв** і **ліг** спати.
   - (He came home, had dinner, and went to bed.)
   - Вона **відкрила** двері, **увійшла** і **привіталася**.
   - (She opened the door, came in, and greeted us.)

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: The Witcher**
>
> In the Ukrainian dub of "The Witcher," Geralt says: "Я **вбив** сотні чудовиськ" (I've killed hundreds of monsters). He uses the perfective **вбив** because each kill was a completed action with a result. But when Yennefer says "Я все життя **боролася** за виживання" (I've been fighting for survival all my life), she uses imperfective **боролася** — it was an ongoing struggle, not a single completed event. This example perfectly illustrates how even quantities (hundreds of monsters) don't determine aspect — it's whether you view the action as completed events or ongoing experience.

### Одна пара — два значення

Understanding aspect pairs is crucial because the same real-world event can be described with either aspect depending on what you want to communicate. This is fundamentally different from English, where you'd use the same verb form regardless of your communicative intent.

**Why This Matters for Communication**

When you say "I read a book" in English, your listener doesn't know if you finished it or just spent time reading. You'd need to add words: "I finished reading" or "I was reading." Ukrainian encodes this distinction in the verb itself, making it impossible to be vague. Every time you speak, you commit to either the process view or the result view.

This creates both challenges and opportunities for English speakers learning Ukrainian:
- **Challenge**: You must decide your communicative intent before speaking, which requires conscious thought.
- **Opportunity**: You can convey nuance that English simply cannot express as elegantly or concisely.

Let's see how the same situation can be expressed differently depending on what you want to emphasize:

**Scenario: Your friend asks about your evening.**

| You say... | You mean... |
|------------|-------------|
| Я **читав** книгу. | I was reading (spending time reading). |
| Я **прочитав** книгу. | I finished reading the book. |
| Я **писав** есе. | I was working on an essay. |
| Я **написав** есе. | I completed/wrote the essay. |
| Я **вчив** нові слова. | I was studying new words. |
| Я **вивчив** нові слова. | I learned the new words (they're in my head now). |

> 🌍 **Real World: Job Interviews**
>
> In Ukrainian job interviews, interviewers often ask two different questions: «Що ви **робили** на попередній роботі?» (imperfective — what did you do there, what was your ongoing work) and «Що ви **зробили**?» (perfective — what did you accomplish/achieve). The first question asks about your responsibilities; the second asks about your results and achievements.

## Deep Dive

### Складні випадки — коли вибір не очевидний

Some contexts make the choice tricky. Let's examine them.

**Common English Speaker Mistakes**

Before we look at specific cases, here are the most common errors English speakers make with aspect, and why they happen:

1. **Using perfective for ongoing actions**: English "I worked all day" is a completed statement, so learners reach for perfective. But Ukrainian sees "all day" as duration → imperfective: Я працював весь день.

2. **Using imperfective for "have you ever" questions**: English "Have you read this book?" uses perfect tense (completed), but Ukrainian uses imperfective because you're asking about general experience, not a specific completed event: Ти читав цю книгу?

3. **Using perfective for habitual past**: English "I called him every day" is completed in the sense that it happened in the past, but Ukrainian sees "every day" as repetition, which requires imperfective aspect: Я дзвонив йому щодня.

4. **Mixing aspects in sequences**: English narrates events without changing verb forms: "He came, sat down, and worked." Ukrainian requires perfective for the completed sequence actions (came, sat) but imperfective for the ongoing activity (worked): Він прийшов, сів і працював.

The key insight: **English past tense is about time. Ukrainian aspect is about perspective.** Don't let English past tense trick you into always choosing perfective.

#### 1. Запитання про досвід

**The "Have You Ever" Paradox**

This is one of the most confusing cases for English speakers. In English, "Have you read this book?" uses the perfect tense, which typically signals completion. So learners naturally reach for perfective. But this is wrong!

The key insight: when you ask "Have you ever...?" in English, you're not asking about a specific completed event. You're asking about general experience — whether someone has that kind of experience in their background. This is conceptually similar to asking "Is reading this book part of your history?" rather than "Did you complete the reading of this book on a specific occasion?"

Ukrainian handles this with imperfective because:
- You're not asking about a specific completed instance
- You're asking about general experience with the activity
- Any answer about completion would require follow-up questions

When asking about experience, Ukrainian typically uses imperfective:

- Ти **читав** цю книгу? (Have you read this book? — ever)
- Ви **були** в Україні? (Have you been to Ukraine?)
- Він **пробував** борщ? (Has he tried borscht?)

But for specific, bounded questions:

- Ти вже **прочитав** те, що я тобі дав? (Have you read what I gave you yet?)
- Ви **встигли** поїсти? (Did you manage to eat?)

> 🔗 **Decision Framework: Past Tense**
>
> | Question | If YES → | If NO → |
> |----------|----------|---------|
> | Was this a single completed event with a result? | Perfective | Keep checking |
> | Did it happen repeatedly or habitually? | Imperfective | Keep checking |
> | Was it the background for another action? | Imperfective | Keep checking |
> | Was it ongoing at a specific moment? | Imperfective | Perfective |

#### 2. Заперечення

**How Negation Changes the Aspectual Meaning**

Negation in Ukrainian isn't just about making a statement negative — the aspect you choose with negation communicates important nuances about your expectations and knowledge. English handles this through context and additional words; Ukrainian builds it into the verb choice.

Consider the English phrase "I haven't read this book." This is ambiguous:
- Does it mean "I've never read this book" (no experience)?
- Or "I haven't read it yet" (but I plan to/should)?

Ukrainian forces you to choose. Your aspect selection reveals your underlying assumption about whether the reading will or should happen.

Negation interacts with aspect in interesting ways:

**General denial (imperfective):**
- Я не **читав** цієї книги. (I haven't read this book — never.)
- Він не **дзвонив** тобі. (He didn't call you — at all.)

**"Not yet" (perfective with ще):**
- Я ще не **прочитав** цієї книги. (I haven't read this book yet — but I will.)
- Він ще не **подзвонив**. (He hasn't called yet — expecting him to.)

#### 3. Імперативи

Commands use aspect differently based on tone and context. This is one area where Ukrainian aspect creates social meaning that English doesn't grammatically encode.

**Understanding Imperative Aspect**

In English, "Come in!" and "Sit down!" are neutral commands. The tone depends on your voice, not the grammar. Ukrainian builds politeness and urgency directly into the verb form.

**The Rule of Thumb**: Imperfective imperatives are invitations; perfective imperatives are instructions. Using the wrong one can sound rude or oddly formal.

**Polite invitations (imperfective):**
- **Заходьте**, будь ласка! (Come in, please!) — welcoming, open-ended
- **Сідайте**! (Have a seat!) — hospitable, no rush
- **Читай** далі! (Keep reading!) — encouraging continuation

**Specific instructions (perfective):**
- **Прочитай** цю статтю до завтра! (Read this article by tomorrow!) — deadline-focused task
- **Напиши** мені, коли приїдеш! (Write to me when you arrive!) — single expected action
- **Зроби** це негайно! (Do this immediately!) — urgent, result-expected

**Why This Matters**: Imagine inviting someone to sit. "Сядьте!" (perfective) sounds like a command from a police officer — sit down NOW and stay there. "Сідайте!" (imperfective) sounds like a gracious host — please, make yourself comfortable, take your time.

> 🎯 **Fun Fact: Medical Ukrainian**
>
> Ukrainian doctors traditionally use imperfective imperatives to sound gentler: «**Дихайте** глибоко» (Breathe deeply), «**Показуйте** язик» (Show your tongue). Perfective commands would sound too abrupt in a medical context — imagine a doctor barking «**Покажіть**!» instead of the softer «**Показуйте**».

### Діалог: У книгарні в Києві

This dialogue demonstrates aspect in a natural conversation about books. Notice how the speakers switch between aspects based on whether they're discussing ongoing activities, completed readings, or general experiences.

**Key aspect switches to watch for:**
- "шукаю" (imperfective) — ongoing search right now
- "читала" (imperfective) — asking about experience (have you read anything?)
- "прочитала" (perfective) — completed reading with result
- "читала" (imperfective) — how long did you spend reading? (duration)
- "прочитала" (perfective) — finished it in a week (result)

**Оксана:** Привіт! Що ти **шукаєш**?

**Тарас:** Привіт! Я **шукаю** щось про українську історію. Ти щось **читала**?

**Оксана:** Так! Я нещодавно **прочитала** "Ворошиловград" Сергія Жадана. Дуже рекомендую!

**Тарас:** О, я теж **хотів** її **прочитати**. А ти довго її **читала**?

**Оксана:** Ні, **прочитала** за тиждень. Не могла **відірватися**!

**Тарас:** Добре, візьму. А що ти зараз **читаєш**?

**Оксана:** "Доця" Тамари Горіхи Зерня. Ще не **закінчила**, але вже можу сказати — це шедевр.

**Тарас:** Скільки вже **прочитала**?

**Оксана:** Половину. **Почала** вчора і не можу **зупинитися**.

### Діалог: На роботі в Харкові

This workplace dialogue shows how aspect communicates progress and completion in professional contexts. Pay attention to how the boss uses perfective for result-focused questions while the employee uses both aspects to explain the status of their work.

**Key patterns:**
- Boss asking about completion: perfective (написав, перевірив)
- Employee describing ongoing work: imperfective (писав, перевіряв, виправляю)
- Employee promising future completion: perfective (закінчу, надішлю)

**Керівник:** Олексію, ти вже **написав** звіт?

**Олексій:** Я його **писав** усю ніч, але ще не **закінчив**.

**Керівник:** А коли **закінчиш**?

**Олексій:** **Закінчу** до обіду, обіцяю.

**Керівник:** Добре. А ти **перевірив** дані?

**Олексій:** **Перевіряв**, але знайшов кілька помилок. Зараз **виправляю**.

**Керівник:** Коли все **виправиш**, **надішли** мені на пошту.

**Олексій:** Так, **надішлю** одразу, як **закінчу**.

### Діалог: Розмова друзів у Одесі

This friendly conversation illustrates aspect in casual contexts. Notice how asking about past activities often uses imperfective (дзвонила — she was calling all day, not a single completed call), while reporting what you did uses both aspects depending on whether you're describing the activity itself or its completion.

**Марина:** Де ти **була** вчора? Я тобі весь день **дзвонила**.

**Ірина:** Вибач, я **ходила** на виставку. Телефон **залишила** вдома.

**Марина:** Яку виставку?

**Ірина:** Сучасного мистецтва. **Пробула** там п'ять годин!

**Марина:** О, так довго **дивилася**?

**Ірина:** Так! **Подивилася** все, що там було. І навіть **купила** картину!

**Марина:** Правда? **Покажеш**?

**Ірина:** Звісно! **Завезу** її тобі завтра.

### Діалог: У кафе в Карпатах

This dialogue showcases aspect in a tourism context. The tourist asks about the present situation using imperfective, while the local describes past experiences using imperfective for habitual actions and general facts.

**Турист:** Вибачте, я **шукаю** готель "Карпатські зорі". Ви не **знаєте**, де він?

**Місцевий:** Так, **знаю**. Я там **працював** років п'ять тому.

**Турист:** А ви **ходили** туди пішки чи **їздили**?

**Місцевий:** Зазвичай **ходив** пішки, але коли **йшов** дощ — **їздив** автобусом.

**Турист:** А як туди **дістатися**?

**Місцевий:** **Ідіть** прямо до перехрестя, потім **поверніть** наліво. Там **побачите** вивіску.

**Турист:** Дякую! А ви давно тут **живете**?

**Місцевий:** Усе життя тут **живу**. **Народився** тут і **виріс**.

> 📜 **Historical Background**
>
> The Ukrainian aspect system has developed over centuries. Old Ukrainian texts from the Kyivan Rus' period already show clear aspectual distinctions. Some scholars believe that the Slavic aspect system is one of the oldest grammatical features, predating even the separation of individual Slavic languages. This deep historical foundation explains why aspect is so fundamental to how Slavic languages work — it's not an add-on feature but a core organizational principle of the verb system that has been refined over a millennium.

## Practice

### How to Approach Aspect Exercises

When practicing aspect, many learners try to memorize which verb goes with which situation. This doesn't work — there are too many verbs and situations. Instead, develop a mental checklist:

**Step 1: Identify the temporal context**
- Is there a duration marker (годину, весь день, довго)? → Usually imperfective
- Is there a result marker (вже, нарешті, до кінця)? → Usually perfective
- Is there a repetition marker (щодня, завжди, часто)? → Imperfective

**Step 2: Consider the communicative goal**
- Are you describing how time was spent? → Imperfective
- Are you stating what was accomplished? → Perfective
- Are you narrating sequential events? → Perfective
- Are you providing background information? → Imperfective

**Step 3: Check for special contexts**
- General experience questions ("Have you ever...?") → Imperfective
- "Not yet" statements → Perfective with "ще"
- Polite imperatives → Imperfective
- Direct commands → Perfective

With practice, this checklist becomes automatic — but at first, consciously work through it for each sentence.

### Модель: Визначення виду

Read each sentence and identify whether the verb is perfective (доконаний) or imperfective (недоконаний), then explain why.

**Приклад:**
- Він **читав** книгу. → Недоконаний. Тривала дія, процес, без вказівки на завершення.
- Він **прочитав** книгу. → Доконаний. Завершена дія з результатом.

**Вправа:**
1. Вона **писала** листа годину.
2. Вона **написала** листа за годину.
3. Ми часто **гуляли** в парку.
4. Учора ми **погуляли** в парку.
5. Він **вчив** англійську все життя.
6. Він нарешті **вивчив** англійську.

### Модель: Вибір виду

Complete with the correct aspect form based on context:

**Приклад:**
- Що ти ___ (робити/зробити) вчора? → **робив** (asking about general activities)
- Ти вже ___ (робити/зробити) домашню роботу? → **зробив** (asking about completion)

### Reading Practice: Історія одного дня

Before reading the passage below, let's understand what to look for. This passage demonstrates how native speakers mix aspects naturally. Pay attention to:

**Sequence actions** (perfective): When events happen one after another in sequence, Ukrainian uses perfective verbs because each action is completed before the next begins.

**Background/ongoing actions** (imperfective): When describing what was happening at the same time as other events, or what someone was doing over a period of time, Ukrainian uses imperfective.

**Result-focused statements** (perfective with "вже")**: When emphasizing that something is already done, Ukrainian uses perfective to show the completed result.

Now read the passage:

Марія **прокинулася** рано вранці. Вона **встала**, **вмилася** і **пішла** на кухню. Там вона **готувала** сніданок, поки її чоловік ще **спав**. Коли Тарас **прокинувся**, сніданок вже **був готовий**.

— Ти вже **встала**? — **запитав** він.
— Так, я давно не **сплю**, — **відповіла** Марія. — Я вже **приготувала** сніданок і **випила** каву.

Вони **поснідали** разом. Тарас **їв** повільно, бо весь час **читав** новини на телефоні. Марія **прибрала** зі столу і **помила** посуд. Потім вони обоє **пішли** на роботу.

**Analysis of the passage:**

Notice the pattern: The morning sequence uses all perfective verbs (прокинулася, встала, вмилася, пішла) because these are sequential completed actions — she woke up, then got up, then washed, then went to the kitchen. Each step finished before the next began.

But when the narrator zooms into what was happening in the kitchen, we switch to imperfective (готувала, спав) because these were ongoing background actions. Maria was cooking (a process) while her husband was sleeping (ongoing state).

The dialogue uses "вже" with perfective (вже встала, вже приготувала, вже випила) to emphasize completed results — she's already awake, breakfast is already made, coffee is already drunk.

Then Taras "їв повільно" and "читав" — both imperfective because these describe how he was spending his time during breakfast (ongoing activity), not completed events. Finally, the cleanup and departure return to perfective (прибрала, помила, пішли) — completed sequence actions again.

> 🎭 **Фольклорний куточок**
>
> В українських народних казках вид часто сигналізує про магічний момент перетворення. When Kotyhoroshko (Котигорошко) fights the dragon, the narrator switches from imperfective (the ongoing battle) to perfective (the decisive blow): «Вони **билися** три дні і три ночі. Нарешті Котигорошко **вдарив** Змія мечем — і **переміг**!» The aspectual shift marks the turning point of the story.

# Підсумок

**What You've Learned: A Mental Model for Aspect**

Before we summarize in Ukrainian, let's crystallize the English speaker's approach to Ukrainian aspect:

**The Core Question**: Whenever you want to say something in the past (or future), ask yourself: "Am I interested in the activity/process itself, or in the result/completion?"

- **Process/Activity** → Imperfective (недоконаний)
- **Result/Completion** → Perfective (доконаний)

**Quick Decision Guide**:

| Situation | Aspect | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| How someone spent time | Imperfective | Focus on the activity |
| What was accomplished | Perfective | Focus on the result |
| Repeated/habitual action | Imperfective | No single completion point |
| Sequence of events | Perfective | Each event finished |
| Background action | Imperfective | Ongoing while other things happened |
| Single bounded event | Perfective | One complete occurrence |

**The Biggest Mistake to Avoid**:

English speakers often think: "This happened in the past, so it's completed, so I should use perfective." This is wrong!

"I worked all day" happened and is over — but the focus is on how you spent your time (process), so Ukrainian uses imperfective: Я працював весь день.

"I finished the work" happened and is over — and the focus is on the completion (result), so Ukrainian uses perfective: Я закінчив роботу.

Both are past tense. Both are "completed" in the English sense. But only one has a result that matters to the speaker.

**Your Native Language Advantage**:

Here's what many learners don't realize: English already has some aspectual thinking built in. Consider:

- "I was reading" (progressive) vs "I read" (simple) — you already distinguish ongoing from general.
- "I have finished" (perfect) vs "I finished" (simple) — you already distinguish result-relevant from past narrative.

Ukrainian just makes these distinctions obligatory and consistent across all contexts. You're not learning something completely foreign — you're systematizing intuitions you already have.

У цьому модулі ви вивчили:

**Недоконаний вид:**
- Показує процес, тривалість, повторюваність
- Використовується для загальних тверджень і запитань про досвід
- У запереченні означає "ніколи" або "взагалі не"
- В імперативі звучить м'якше, як запрошення

**Доконаний вид:**
- Показує результат, одноразовість, завершеність
- Використовується для послідовності подій
- У запереченні з "ще не" означає "поки що не"
- В імперативі звучить як конкретна інструкція

**Ключова ідея:** Вибір виду залежить не від того, ЩО сталося, а від того, ЯК мовець хоче представити дію — як процес чи як завершений результат.

> 💡 **Порада для практики**
>
> Коли говорите українською, завжди запитуйте себе: "Що важливіше в цьому контексті — сам процес чи результат?" Якщо ви описуєте, як провели час — недоконаний. Якщо ви повідомляєте про досягнення — доконаний. Ця проста перевірка допоможе вам обрати правильний вид у більшості ситуацій.
