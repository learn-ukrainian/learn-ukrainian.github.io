## Introduction - Why Learn Grammar in Ukrainian?

### Виклик вивчення граматики новою мовою

Think about how you learned grammar in school. Someone taught you terms like "noun," "verb," "adjective." Now imagine picking up a Ukrainian grammar book. You open it and see: *"Іменник стоїть у родовому відмінку після прийменника..."*

If you don't know that **іменник** means "noun," **родовий відмінок** means "genitive case," and **прийменник** means "preposition," you're lost. This module solves that problem.

There is a linguistic truth: **«Хто мови не знає, той і граматики не розуміє.»** — "Who doesn't know the language, doesn't understand grammar either." The terms you'll learn here are the keys that unlock every Ukrainian grammar resource.

### Why Ukrainians Learn This Too

Every Ukrainian schoolchild learns these terms in school. When a Ukrainian teacher says "Поставте дієслово в минулому часі," students know they need to put the verb in past tense. These aren't foreign concepts — they're just new words for ideas you already understand.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian grammar terminology comes largely from Church Slavonic and Latin traditions, brought to Kyiv by scholars at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in the 17th century. The word **відмінок** literally means "change" or "variation" — because the word *changes* form depending on its role in the sentence. Think of **дієслово** as "action-word"—it's built from **дія** (action) and **слово** (word). This calque (loan translation) pattern is common: **займенник** (pronoun) means "instead of a name" (за-іменник), mirroring the Latin *pro-nomen*.

### The Psychological Shift

Moving from A2 to B1 is about shifting your mental operating system. At A2, you translated from English to Ukrainian. At B1, you start learning how to think *in* Ukrainian. Learning grammar terms is the first step. When you can say "Це дієслово недоконаного виду" instead of "It's an imperfective verb," you are categorizing the world like a Ukrainian speaker.

This module isn't just a glossary list; it's an initiation into the linguistic logic of the language. You will learn not just the *labels*, but the *concepts* they represent—concepts that sometimes don't even exist in English (like **вид** or **кличний відмінок**). Prepare to see the language from the inside out.

## Parts of Speech (Частини мови)

Українська мова має десять частин мови. На рівні B1 вам потрібно впізнавати всі їх за українськими назвами. Розуміння цих термінів є важливим, тому що відтепер ви будете зустрічати пояснення граматики, написані повністю українською мовою. Носії мови не думають про граматику, використовуючи англійську термінологію — вони використовують власну багату систему термінів, яка розвивалася століттями.

The ten parts of speech divide into two main groups: самостійні частини мови (content words) and службові частини мови (function words). The content words carry independent meaning and can function as sentence elements on their own. The function words exist to connect, modify, and structure sentences — they cannot stand alone as sentence elements.

### Content Words (Самостійні частини мови)

These are the words that carry meaning:

| Термін         | English   | Example                |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| **іменник**    | noun      | книга, стіл, Київ      |
| **дієслово**   | verb      | читати, писати, бігти  |
| **прикметник** | adjective | гарний, великий, синій |
| **прислівник** | adverb    | швидко, добре, тут     |
| **займенник**  | pronoun   | я, ти, він, вона       |
| **числівник**  | numeral   | один, два, перший      |

Let's see these in action. **Оксана читає «Кобзар».** Here, **Оксана** is the іменник (who's reading?), **читає** is the дієслово (what's she doing?), and **«Кобзар»** is the іменник (what is she reading?).

Or consider: **Тарас швидко біжить на метро «Хрещатик».** The word **Тарас** is an іменник, **швидко** is a прислівник telling us how he runs, and **біжить** is the дієслово.

> 🌍 **Real World: Grammar Discussions**
>
> When Ukrainians discuss language on forums or social media, they use these terms freely. You might see: "Тут треба вжити дієслово доконаного виду" (Here you need to use a perfective verb). Without knowing **дієслово** and **вид**, you'd miss the point entirely.

Notice how each Ukrainian term describes what the word category does. The іменник comes from "ім'я" — it names things. The прикметник comes from "прикмета" — it describes characteristics. The прислівник literally means "by the verb" — adverbs typically modify verbs. Understanding these etymologies helps you remember the terms.

#### Як розпізнати частини мови

Even if you don't know a word's meaning, its shape often reveals its grammatical identity (частина мови).

1.  **Іменники:**
    - Often end in **-а/я** (жіночий рід: *мова, пісня*).
    - Often end in a consonant (чоловічий рід: *стіл, дуб*).
    - Often end in **-о/е** (середній рід: *вікно, море*).
    - *Role:* They answer **хто?** (who?) or **що?** (what?).

2.  **Прикметники:**
    - Almost always end in **-ий, -а, -е, -і**.
    - *Examples:* гарн**ий**, гарн**а**, гарн**е**, гарн**і**.
    - *Role:* They answer **який? яка? яке? які?** (what kind?).

3.  **Дієслова:**
    - Infinitives end in **-ти** (*читати, знати*).
    - Present tense forms end in **-ю, -єш, -е, -емо, -ете, -ють** (or similar).
    - Past tense ends in **-в, -ла, -ло, -ли**.
    - *Role:* They answer **що робити? що зробити?** (what to do?).

4.  **Прислівники:**
    - Often end in **-о** (*швидко, мало, добре*).
    - Never change form (no gender, no case, no number).
    - *Role:* They answer **як? де? коли?** (how? where? when?).

This structural intuition is vital. Spotting a word ending in **-ого** should instantly trigger "adjective in genitive case" in your mind, even before you know the root. Similarly, seeing **-ому** suggests "dative or locative." This is how Ukrainians read rapidly—they parse the grammar endings effortlessly.

### Understanding the Big Picture

Grammar isn't just about rules; it's about relationships.

- **Іменник** names the reality.
- **Прикметник** colors the reality.
- **Дієслово** moves the reality.
- **Прислівник** describes the movement.

Combining them creates a sentence: *Гарний студент швидко читає.* (Reality + Color + Movement + Description).

> ⚠️ **Common Learner Confusion**
>
> Beginners often confuse adjectives (прикметники) and adverbs (прислівники) because they share the same root. Learn to see the difference:
>
> - **Це швидкий потяг.** — "швидк**ий**" describes the *noun* потяг → прикметник
> - **Потяг їде швидко.** — "швидк**о**" describes *how* it moves (the *verb*) → прислівник
>
> Same root *швидк-*, but different endings: **-ий** for adjective, **-о** for adverb.
>
> **Simple rule:** Describing a thing (noun)? Use прикметник (-ий/-а/-е). Describing an action (verb)? Use прислівник (-о).

### Function Words (Службові частини мови)

These words don't carry meaning on their own — they connect and modify. Think of them as the glue that holds sentences together. Without прийменники, you couldn't show relationships between objects. Without сполучники, you couldn't connect clauses. These words are essential for constructing complex sentences:

| Термін         | English      | Example         |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| **прийменник** | preposition  | в, на, до, з    |
| **сполучник**  | conjunction  | і, але, бо, що  |
| **частка**     | particle     | не, ні, хай, би |
| **вигук**      | interjection | ой, ах, гей     |

Watch how these work: **Книга лежить на столі.** The word **на** is a прийменник — it connects the book to the table and tells us where. **Я хочу піти, але не маю часу.** Here **але** is a сполучник joining two ideas. **Вона не прийде сьогодні.** The tiny word **не** is a частка — it flips the meaning from "she will come" to "she won't come."

And when you stub your toe? **Ой, як боляче!** That **ой** is a вигук — pure emotion, no grammar required.

### The Master Category

| Термін           | English        | Meaning                        |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **частина мови** | part of speech | The category a word belongs to |

The частка is particularly interesting — it's a small word that adds nuance to sentences. The most common частка is "не", which negates verbs and adjectives. The word "частка" itself means "small part" — these are the smallest functional elements of speech. Other common частки include "хай" for imperatives, "би" for conditionals, and "ні" for emphatic negation.

> 🗣️ **Colloquial Corner: Ukrainian "Yep" and "Nope"**
>
> Beyond standard **так** and **ні**, Ukrainian has expressive alternatives:
>
> | Phrase | Meaning | Usage |
> |--------|---------|-------|
> | **Та** | Yep / Yeah | Casual agreement |
> | **Ага** / **Угу** | Uh-huh / Yep | Informal agreement |
> | **Авжеж** / **Еге ж** | Of course / Sure | Emphatic yes |
> | **Та ні** | Oh no / Not really | Soft disagreement |
> | **Та де!** | No way! / Not at all! | Emotional denial |
> | **Де там!** | Not a chance! | When something's unlikely |
> | **Аж ніяк** | By no means | Categorical denial |
> | **Отож-бо й воно** | That's just it | Ironic negation (very Ukrainian) |
>
> These add color and emotion that plain так/ні can't convey.

## Case Names (Відмінки)

You've been using Ukrainian cases since A1. Now you'll learn their Ukrainian names. Ukrainian is a highly inflected language, meaning that word endings change based on grammatical function. These changes are organized into seven відмінків. When a Ukrainian grammar book tells you to put a noun in the родовий відмінок, you need to know exactly which ending patterns to apply.

Each case has a specific function and a specific set of question words that help you identify it. Memorizing the питання for each case is just as important as memorizing the case names themselves:

| Number | Українська назва | English      | Question          | Example  |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | -------- |
| 1      | **називний**     | nominative   | хто? що?          | книга    |
| 2      | **родовий**      | genitive     | кого? чого?       | книги    |
| 3      | **давальний**    | dative       | кому? чому?       | книзі    |
| 4      | **знахідний**    | accusative   | кого? що?         | книгу    |
| 5      | **орудний**      | instrumental | ким? чим?         | книгою   |
| 6      | **місцевий**     | locative     | на кому? на чому? | на книзі |
| 7      | **кличний**      | vocative     | —                 | книго!   |

Let's trace one noun through all seven cases. Take **сестра** — sister:

**Сестра прийшла.** (називний — who came?)
**Немає сестри.** (родовий — there's no whom?)
**Дав сестрі подарунок.** (давальний — gave to whom?)
**Бачу сестру.** (знахідний — I see whom?)
**Розмовляю з сестрою.** (орудний — talking with whom?)
**На сестрі гарна сукня.** (місцевий — on whom is the dress?)
**Сестро, допоможи!** (кличний — calling out to her)

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> The case names come from their functions:
>
> - **Називний** (from "називати" — to name) is for naming the subject
> - **Родовий** (from "рід" — origin/kind) shows origin or possession
> - **Давальний** (from "давати" — to give) marks the recipient
> - **Знахідний** (from "знаходити" — to find) marks the direct object
> - **Орудний** (from "орудувати" — to use as a tool) marks the instrument
> - **Місцевий** (from "місце" — place) marks location
> - **Кличний** (from "кликати" — to call) is for direct address

### Deep Dive: The Seven Cases Explained

Let's look closer at each case so you can talk about them with precision.

#### 1. Називний відмінок

- **Keyword:** Subject / Підмет
- **Questions:** Хто? Що?
- **Function:** This is the dictionary form. The actor of the sentence.
- **Example:** "**Студент** читає." (Student is the actor).
- **Metalanguage:** "Слово стоїть у називному відмінку." (The word is in the nominative case).

#### 2. Родовий відмінок

- **Keyword:** Possession / Absence / Of
- **Questions:** Кого? Чого?
- **Function:** Shows ownership (*book of Ivan*), lack of something (*no time*), or part of a whole. It is the most frequent case after Nominative.
- **Example:** "Немає **часу**." (No time). "Книга **Андрія**." (Andriy's book).
- **Metalanguage:** "Після прийменника 'без' вживаємо родовий відмінок." (After 'without' we use genitive).

#### 3. Давальний відмінок

- **Keyword:** Recipient / To
- **Questions:** Кому? Чому?
- **Function:** Indicates the person receiving something, or the person experiencing a state (indirect object).
- **Example:** "Я допомагаю **другу**." (Helping [to] friend). "Мені холодно." ([To] me it is cold).
- **Metalanguage:** "Дієслово 'допомагати' вимагає давального відмінка." (The verb 'to help' requires dative).

#### 4. Знахідний відмінок

- **Keyword:** Target / Direct Object
- **Questions:** Кого? Що?
- **Function:** The object that the action happens to.
- **Example:** "Я бачу **дівчину**." (I see the girl). "Я читаю **книгу**." (I read the book).
- **Metalanguage:** "Тут потрібен додаток у знахідному відмінку." (Here an object in accusative is needed).

#### 5. Орудний відмінок

- **Keyword:** Tool / With / As
- **Questions:** Ким? Чим?
- **Function:** How something is done (with a pen), accompaniment (with mom), or identity (working as a doctor).
- **Example:** "Я пишу **ручкою**." (Writing with a pen). "Він працює **лікарем**." (He works as a doctor).
- **Metalanguage:** "Орудний відмінок означає інструмент дії." (Instrumental case signifies the tool of action).

#### 6. Місцевий відмінок

- **Keyword:** Location / About
- **Questions:** На/У кому? На/У чому?
- **Function:** Used *only* with prepositions (на, у, по, при) to show location or the topic of thought/speech.
- **Example:** "Книга на **столі**." (On the table). "Ми говоримо про **політику**." (About politics).
- **Metalanguage:** "Місцевий відмінок завжди вживається з прийменником." (Locative case is always used with a preposition).

#### 7. Кличний відмінок

- **Keyword:** Hey you! / Address
- **Questions:** —
- **Function:** Used to call someone or address them directly. It adds warmth and respect. It is unique to Ukrainian among major Slavic languages (Russian lost it).
- **Example:** "**Мамо**, де ти?" (Mom!). "**Іване**, привіт." (Ivan!). "**Україно**, вставай!" (Ukraine, rise!).
- **Metalanguage:** "При звертанні використовуйте кличний відмінок." (When addressing, use vocative).

## Basic Sentence Terms

Ви вже знаєте частини мови та відмінки — це чудовий прогрес! Тепер додамо ще кілька термінів, які постійно з'являються в граматичних поясненнях.

When you read an explanation like "Дієслово змінюється за особами та числами" (The verb changes according to person and number), you need to know what особа and число mean. These terms appear constantly in grammar textbooks, online resources, and language learning apps.

The concept of рід is fundamental to Ukrainian grammar. Every noun has a gender — чоловічий, жіночий, or середній — and this gender determines how adjectives, pronouns, and past-tense verbs agree with the noun. The term число refers to whether something is однина or множина:

| Термін         | English  | Example                      |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| **слово**      | word     | "книга" — це слово           |
| **речення**    | sentence | Це коротке речення.          |
| **рід**        | gender   | чоловічий, жіночий, середній |
| **число**      | number   | однина, множина              |
| **особа**      | person   | перша, друга, третя          |
| **закінчення** | ending   | -а, -ою, -і                  |

See how these work together: **Новий студент прийшов.** vs. **Нова студентка прийшла.** The adjective **новий/нова** and the past tense verb **прийшов/прийшла** both change based on the рід of the noun.

### Exploring the Categories

#### 1. Рід

Like most European languages, Ukrainian uses grammatical gender. Adjectives, verbs, and pronouns all agree with the noun's gender.

- **Чоловічий рід:** Usually consonant endings (*дім, стіл, брат*).
- **Жіночий рід:** Usually -а/-я endings (*мама, пісня, кава*).
- **Середній рід:** Usually -о/-е endings (*вікно, море, сонце*).

Grammar explanations will often say: *"Прикметник узгоджується з іменником у роді, числі та відмінку."* (The adjective agrees with the noun in gender, number, and case). This phrase describes the core mechanic of the Ukrainian language.

#### 2. Число

Basic concept: one or many?

- **Однина:** *Студент*.
- **Множина:** *Студенти*.

Some nouns exist *only* in plural (pluralia tantum): **двері** (door/doors), **окуляри** (glasses), **гроші** (money). A grammar book might note: *"Іменник 'гроші' вживається тільки у множині."*

#### 3. Особа

This applies mostly to verbs and pronouns.

- **1-ша особа:** Я (однина), Ми (множина). Speaker.
- **2-га особа:** Ти (однина), Ви (множина). Addressee.
- **3-тя особа:** Він/Вона/Воно (однина), Вони (множина). Topic.

Why does this matter? Because conjugation (відмінювання дієслів) depends entirely on person.

- Reading a dictionary: "Verbs of the first conjugation take -ють in the 3rd person plural."
- Translation: Дієслова першої дієвідміни мають закінчення -ють у третій особі множини.
- Example: *Думати* -> \*Вони дума**ють\***.

#### 4. Час

Verbs exist in time.

- **Теперішній час:** *Я читаю.* (Now).
- **Минулий час:** *Я читав.* (Before).
- **Майбутній час:** *Я буду читати.* (Later).

#### 5. Вид

This is the superpower of Slavic verbs. Every action is either a process or a result.

- **Недоконаний вид:** Process, repetition, duration. *Читати* (to be reading).
- **Доконаний вид:** Result, completion, one-time. *Прочитати* (to finish reading).

You will dive deep into **вид** in Module 06, but you need the word now. Why? Because dictionaries list pairs: *читати/прочитати*. They are labeled *недок.* and *док.* knowing these abbreviations is essential for using a dictionary.

And особа? Watch: **Я читаю.** (перша особа — I), **Ти читаєш.** (друга особа — you), **Він читає.** (третя особа — he). The закінчення of the verb tells you who's doing the action.

### Why Grammar Terminology Matters for Self-Study

When you study independently using Ukrainian resources, you'll encounter instructions like "Утворіть форму орудного відмінка" (Form the instrumental case). Without knowing that орудний means instrumental and відмінок means case, you can't complete the exercise. Similarly, online forums where Ukrainians discuss language learning use these terms constantly. If someone writes "Тут потрібен давальний" (Here you need dative), you need to know what давальний means.

Imagine you're watching a grammar video from Kyiv and the teacher says: **«Зверніть увагу на закінчення дієслова в третій особі.»** If you know the terms, you hear: "Pay attention to the verb ending in third person." If you don't, it's just noise.

Or you're reading a forum post from Львів: **«Тут потрібен родовий відмінок, бо це заперечення.»** Now you understand: "Here you need genitive case, because it's a negation."

The good news is that once you learn these twenty-five terms, they unlock an entire world of Ukrainian-language learning resources. Grammar textbooks written for native speakers become accessible. YouTube explanations in Ukrainian make sense. Even the error messages in language learning apps that explain why your answer was wrong — those become comprehensible when you know the terminology.

## Practice Reading Grammar Explanations

### Pattern Recognition

Look at these Ukrainian grammar instructions and identify what they're asking:

1. *"Поставте іменник у родовому відмінку."*
   - Put the **noun** in the **genitive case**.

2. *"Знайдіть усі дієслова в тексті."*
   - Find all the **verbs** in the text.

3. *"Визначте рід цих іменників."*
   - Determine the **gender** of these **nouns**.

4. *"Утворіть прислівник від прикметника."*
   - Form an **adverb** from the **adjective**.

### Reading Ukrainian Grammar

Here's a sample grammar explanation. Can you understand it?

> *Іменник "книга" — жіночого роду. У знахідному відмінку він має форму "книгу". Після прийменника "на" вживається місцевий відмінок: "на книзі".*

**Translation:** The noun "книга" is feminine gender. In the accusative case, it has the form "книгу". After the preposition "на", the locative case is used: "на книзі".

Let's deduce more from this text.

- **Жіночого роду:** We see the ending -ого, typical for adjectives in Genitive. Wait, why Genitive? Because "of feminine gender." It's stating a property.
- **У знахідному відмінку:** Preposition "у" + Locative ending "-у"? No, because "відмінок" is masculine. This is actually Locative? No, wait. "У" can take Locative or Accusative. Here "відмінку" looks like Locative or Dative. Actually, it is Locative (on/in the case).
- **Вживається:** Reflexive verb (ends in -ся). It means "is used" (literally "uses itself"). This passive construction is extremely common in grammar texts.

When reading grammar rules, look for these keywords:

- **Означає** (means/signifies)
- **Вказує на** (points to/indicates)
- **Виражає** (expresses)
- **Вживається з** (is used with)
- **Змінюється за** (changes according to)
- **Має закінчення** (has the ending)

Knowing these six verbs will let you read 90% of rule explanations.

## Mini-Dialogues

### Діалог 1: На уроці

**Вчитель:** Скажіть, будь ласка, яка частина мови слово "швидко"?

**Студент:** Це прислівник.

**Вчитель:** Правильно! А від якого слова воно утворене?

**Студент:** Від прикметника "швидкий".

**Вчитель:** Молодець! А тепер знайдіть усі прислівники в цьому реченні.

---

### Діалог 2: Розмова друзів

**Оксана:** Я не розумію цю вправу. Тут написано "поставте у давальному відмінку".

**Марко:** Давальний — це третій відмінок. Питання "кому? чому?"

**Оксана:** А, зрозуміло! Тобто замість "книга" буде "книзі"?

**Марко:** Так, правильно. Я даю книгу — кому? — Марії. Це як давати подарунок на день народження — завжди давальний відмінок.

---

### Діалог 3: В університеті

**Професор:** Сьогодні ми поговоримо про дієслово.

**Студентка:** А що таке "дієслово"?

**Професор:** Дієслово — це частина мови, яка називає дію. Наприклад: читати, писати, думати.

**Студентка:** Тобто це те, що в англійській називається "verb"?

**Професор:** Саме так. А українське слово буквально означає "слово дії".

---

### Діалог 4: Готування до іспиту

**Ігор:** Ти вивчив усі відмінки?

**Тетяна:** Так, усі сім. Називний, родовий, давальний, знахідний, орудний, місцевий, кличний.

**Ігор:** А як запам'ятати порядок? Я постійно плутаю орудний і місцевий.

**Тетяна:** Є мнемоніка: "На Різдво Дід Загубив Орішки Між Ковбасками."

**Ігор:** О, класна ідея! Перші букви — Н, Р, Д, З, О, М, К!

**Тетяна:** А ще є інша: "Навіщо Робити Домашнє Завдання, Оля Може Купити."

**Ігор:** Ха-ха, це смішно, але менш корисно для іспиту. А знаєш, як запам'ятати питання?

6. **Research notes** (if exists): `# Research: How to Talk About Grammar (Metalinguistic Competence)

**Module:** B1 M01 "Як говорити про граматику"  
**Level:** B1 (Bridge from A2)  
**Topic:** Metalinguistic Terminology & Language Awareness

## 1. Grammar: State Standard 2024 Reference

The **State Standard of Ukrainian as a Foreign Language (2024)** explicitly requires metalinguistic competence at the B1 level, enabling learners to discuss language phenomena, understand instructions, and ask for clarification using appropriate terminology.

> **Section: Linguistic Competence / Grammatical Subsystem**
> The standard mandates that a learner at the B1 level must:
> *   "Understand and use basic grammatical terminology to facilitate the learning process."
> *   "Identify and name parts of speech (*частини мови*) and grammatical categories (*рід, число, відмінок*) in standard texts."
> *   "Monitor their own speech for basic grammatical accuracy (*самоконтроль*)."

*Note:* While A1/A2 focuses on *using* the forms, B1 requires the ability to *name* and *analyze* them (Language Awareness).

## 2. Vocabulary Frequency & Collocations

The vocabulary for this module shifts from "survival" to "academic/instructional" frequency. These terms are high-frequency in a classroom/textbook context but medium-frequency in general daily speech.

### Core Terminology (High Frequency in Context)
| Term (UA) | English | Category | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Слово** | Word | General | High freq. everywhere. |
| **Речення** | Sentence | Syntax | Essential for instructions. |
| **Правило** | Rule | General | Common in "Це правило" (It's a rule). |
| **Помилка** | Mistake | General | Collocation: *робити помилку* (to make a mistake). |
| **Приклад** | Example | General | "Наприклад" (For example) is already known (A1). |

### Grammatical Categories (Instructional Frequency)
| Term (UA) | English | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Іменник** | Noun | High |
| **Дієслово** | Verb | High |

### Common Collocations (A2/B1 Bridge)
*   **Який це відмінок?** (What case is this?)
*   **Правильна відповідь** (Correct answer)
*   **Виправити помилку** (To correct a mistake)
*   **Наведіть приклад** (Give an example)
*   **Частина мови** (Part of speech)

## 3. Cultural Hook

**The "Culture of Speech" (Культура мови):**
In Ukraine, correct grammar and stress are highly valued and often seen as a marker of education and patriotism, especially in the context of switching from Russian to Ukrainian.
*   **Fact:** There is a popular genre of "Express Ukrainian" lessons (e.g., by Oleksandr Avramenko) on TV and social media where grammatical nuances are explained to the general public. Knowing the "names" of cases and parts of speech allows a learner to participate in this shared cultural striving for linguistic perfection (*вдосконалення мови*).
*   **Fact:** Unlike English speakers who rarely discuss "subjunctive mood" in daily life, Ukrainians frequently discuss *наголос* (stress) and *закінчення* (endings) because the highly inflected nature of the language requires constant attention to form.

## 4. Pedagogical Notes

### Differences from English
*   **Conceptual Gap:** English native speakers often do not know what a "direct object" or "dative case" is even in English.
    *   *Teaching Strategy:* Do not assume they know the *concept*. Re-explain the concept briefly when introducing the Ukrainian label (e.g., "Знахідний implies finding or seeing something -> Accusative").
*   **Naming Convention:** English learners usually learn "Case 1, Case 2... Case 7". Ukrainians learn them by name (*Називний, Родовий...*).
    *   *Goal:* Transition the student from "Genitive" to "*Родовий*" to enable full immersion.
*   **"Article" Confusion:** Students often ask for the word for "the/a". We must explain that *артикль* does not exist in Ukrainian structure, though the word exists to describe English grammar.

### Common Learner Errors
*   Confusing **Буква** (Letter) and **Звук** (Sound).
*   Using *слово* when they mean *речення* (sentence).
*   Mixing up case names (e.g., calling Genitive "Possessive").

## 5. Scope Boundaries

**IN SCOPE (Module B1.01):**
*   **Names of Parts of Speech:** Іменник, дієслово, прикметник, займенник, числівник.
*   **Names of 7 Cases:** Називний through Кличний (just the labels and recognition).
*   **Basic Structure:** Слово, речення, літера, звук.
*   **Gender Labels:** Чоловічий, жіночий, середній.
*   **Number Labels:** Однина, множина.

**OUT OF SCOPE (Save for later B1/B2):**
*   **Complex Syntax Terms:** *Підмет* (Subject), *Присудок* (Predicate), *Додаток* (Object) — stick to "noun/verb" for now to avoid overload.
*   **Advanced Morphology:** *Дієприкметник* (Participle), *Дієприслівник* (Gerund) — these are taught later in B1.
*   **Stylistics:** *Сленг, діалектизм* — too early for deep analysis.
*   **Linguistic Theory:** Deep classifications of declension groups (I, II, III, IV) — teach patterns, but don't force memorization of "Second Declension Hard Group" labels yet.

**Do not proceed until you have read every line of the content and every activity item.**

> **ANTI-STALE-REVIEW RULE**: This file may have been fixed since a previous review. You MUST review the CURRENT state of the files, not repeat findings from a prior review. If an issue was cited before but is now fixed, it must NOT appear in your review. Every finding must be verifiable by quoting the actual current content.

## STEP 1: PLAN VERIFICATION

Cross-check content against the plan file:

1. **Outline compliance**: Is every section from `content_outline` present as an H2/H3?
2. **Vocabulary scope**: List every Ukrainian vocabulary word taught in the content. Compare against `vocabulary_hints.required` in the plan. Flag any word NOT in the plan.
3. **Grammar scope**: What grammar does this module teach? What grammar from LATER modules appears in examples or dialogues? (This is scope creep — flag it.)
4. **Objectives**: Are all learning objectives from the plan addressed in the content?

Report findings as:
```
Plan-Content Alignment: [PASS/FAIL]
- Sections: [all present / missing: X, Y]
- Vocabulary: [X/Y from plan used, Z extra words found]
- Grammar scope: [clean / scope creep: specific items]
- Objectives: [all covered / missing: X]
```

---

## STEP 2: DEEP VERIFICATION (Line by Line)

### Ukrainian Sentences
Go through the file section by section. For EACH Ukrainian sentence:
- Is grammar correct? (cases, verb forms, agreement)
- Does it sound natural? (not robotic, not calqued from English)
- Are there Russianisms? (check against list below)
- Is vocabulary appropriate for the level?

### English Sentences
- Is it clear and accessible?
- Warm tutor voice or cold textbook?
- Over-explaining simple things? Under-explaining complex ones?

### IPA Transcriptions (if present)
- Every transcription must be checked for correct stress placement
- Ukrainian stress is unpredictable — verify each one
- Watch for English approximations instead of Ukrainian phonemes

### Activities (EVERY ITEM)

**CRITICAL: Read the actual YAML file line by line.** Do NOT assume what the file contains — read it. If a previous review said "add English cues" but the file already has them, acknowledge the fix is present. Never cite an issue that doesn't exist in the CURRENT file.

Check each activity item individually:
- **quiz**: Grammatically correct? Exactly one correct answer? Options plausible?
- **fill-in**: Sentence correct with answer filled in? Only ONE valid answer given the context/cues? Distractors plausible?
- **match-up**: All pairs correct? No duplicates?
- **true-false**: True statements actually true? False clearly false?
- **unjumble**: Answer forms a correct, natural sentence?
- **group-sort**: Items correctly categorized?
- **anagram**: Solution correct? Hint clear?

Count as you go. You MUST report how many items you checked.

**Verification rule**: For EVERY issue you cite, quote the EXACT line from the file. If you cannot quote it, the issue does not exist.

---

## STEP 3: AUTO-FAIL CHECKLIST

Check EVERY category. Report "[CLEAN]" or list specific findings.

### Russianisms
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| кушать | їсти |
| приймати участь | брати участь |
| самий кращий | найкращий |
| слідуючий | наступний |
| на протязі | протягом |
| любий (any) | будь-який |
| отвічати | відповідати |
| вообще | взагалі |
| получати | отримувати |
| відноситися | ставитися |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Calques
| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| робити сенс | мати сенс |
| брати місце | відбуватися |
| це є | це (usually) |

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with line numbers]

### Grammar Scope Violations
At module 1, students know ONLY modules 1-0. Any grammar from later modules is scope creep.
- Past tense (if not yet taught)
- Cases not yet introduced
- Verb forms not yet taught

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list specific violations with line numbers]

### Activity Errors
- Wrong answer marked as correct
- Multiple valid answers but only one accepted
- Grammatically incorrect sentences
- Duplicate items

**Finding:** [CLEAN] or [list with activity number and item number]

### Beginner Safety ("Would I Continue?" Test)
| Question | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Did I feel overwhelmed? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Were instructions clear? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Did I get quick wins? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Was Ukrainian scary? | [Pass/Fail] |
| Would I come back tomorrow? | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Total** | **X/5** |

Emotional beats found:
- Welcome/orientation: [yes/no, where]
- Curiosity trigger: [yes/no, where]
- Quick wins: [count, where]
- Encouragement: [count, where]
- Progress marker: [yes/no, where]

## STEP 4: SCORE DIMENSIONS

**Score ONLY after completing Steps 1-3.** Each score must link to specific findings.

### Scoring Rules
- **9-10**: Excellent — no issues found in this dimension
- **7-8**: Good — minor issues found
- **5-6**: Needs work — multiple issues
- **<5**: Serious problems — major rewrite needed
- **If you found 3 grammar errors, Language cannot be 9**
- **If scope creep found, Relevance and Pedagogy cannot be 8+**

### Auto-Fail Thresholds
| Dimension | Auto-fail if below |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Experience Quality | <7 |
| Coherence | <7 |
| Relevance | <7 |
| Educational | <7 |
| Language | <8 |
| Pedagogy | <7 |
| Immersion | <6 |
| Activities | <7 |
| Richness | <6 |
| Beginner Safety | <7 |
| LLM Fingerprint | <7 |
| Linguistic Accuracy | <9 |

### Weighted Overall Score
```
Overall = (Experience × 1.5 + Coherence × 1.0 + Relevance × 1.0 + Educational × 1.2 +
          Language × 1.1 + Pedagogy × 1.2 + Immersion × 1.0 + Activities × 1.3 +
          Richness × 0.9 + Beginner_Safety × 1.3 + LLM × 1.0 + Linguistic_Accuracy × 1.5) / 14.0
```

**Quality target: 9.0+ overall AND no dimension below its auto-fail threshold.**
**If the score is below 9.0, you MUST provide a Fix Plan (see output format) with specific actions to reach 9/10.** The fix plan drives the iteration loop — Claude will send fixes to Gemini until the module reaches 9.0+.
