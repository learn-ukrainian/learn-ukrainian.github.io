## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Linguistic Accuracy (Typo in Example)
- **Location**: "Case Names (Відмінки)" Section / Table Row 7
- **Original**: `7 | кличний | vocative | — | книжкою`
- **Problem**: "книжкою" is the Instrumental of the diminutive "книжка". The Vocative of "книга" is "книго!".
- **Fix**: Change "книжкою" to "книго!" in the table row for Vocative.

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| Table | "книжкою" | "книго!" | Grammar (Wrong Case/Example) |

## Verdict

**PASS**

The module is a masterclass in B1 "Bridge" content.

Apart from a single typo in the case table, the linguistic and pedagogical quality is exceptional.
