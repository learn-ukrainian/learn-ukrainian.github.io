# Дієприслівники доконаного виду

> 🎯 **Чому це важливо**
>
> «Прочитавши книгу, він заснув» — дієприслівники доконаного виду показують послідовність: спочатку одне, потім інше. Разом з недоконаними вони дають повну картину.

## Діагностика

Read the following text. Notice that some actions happen BEFORE other actions, not at the same time.

> Прочитавши статтю, Олег закрив ноутбук. Подумавши хвилину, він вирішив зателефонувати другові. Набравши номер, він почекав. Почувши голос друга, він усміхнувся. Поговоривши годину, вони домовилися зустрітися.

**Questions:**
1. What did Oleg do AFTER reading the article?
2. Did he think before or after deciding to call his friend?
3. What happened first: dialing the number or waiting?
4. When did he smile — before or after hearing his friend's voice?

> 💡 **Pattern Discovery**
> Notice the words ending in **-вши** and **-ши**: *прочитавши, подумавши, набравши, почувши, поговоривши*. These are **perfective adverbial participles** — they describe an action that was **completed before** the main verb's action.

## Аналіз

### The Key Difference: BEFORE vs. WHILE

In Module 36, you learned imperfective participles for **simultaneous** actions. Now, perfective participles show **sequence** — one action finished BEFORE another began.

**Compare:**

| Imperfective (simultaneous) | Perfective (sequential) |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Читаючи** книгу, він пив каву. | **Прочитавши** книгу, він заснув. |
| *(While reading, he drank coffee.)* | *(Having read the book, he fell asleep.)* |
| Both actions happen together | Reading finished FIRST, then sleeping |

> 🔗 **Language Link: English Patterns**
> 
> Perfective adverbial participles correspond to English "having + past participle":
> - *Прочитавши* = Having read
> - *Закінчивши* = Having finished
> - *Прийшовши* = Having arrived
> 
> They also translate as "After + -ing" or "Once + clause":
> - *Прочитавши статтю...* = After reading / Once he had read / Having read the article...

---

### Formation Rules

Perfective adverbial participles are formed from the **past tense stem** of perfective verbs:

**Formula:** Past tense stem + **-вши** (after vowel) OR **-ши** (after consonant)

| Perfective Infinitive | Past Tense | Stem | Participle | Meaning |
|----------------------|------------|------|------------|---------|
| прочитати | прочита**в** | прочита- | прочита**вши** | having read |
| написати | написа**в** | написа- | написа**вши** | having written |
| сказати | сказа**в** | сказа- | сказа**вши** | having said |
| зробити | зроби**в** | зроби- | зроби**вши** | having done |
| принести | приніс | приніс- | приніс**ши** | having brought |
| прийти | прийшо**в** | прийшо- | прийшо**вши** | having arrived |

> [!observe] Key Pattern
> - If past tense ends in **vowel + в** (зробив): use **-вши** (зробивши)
> - If past tense ends in **consonant** (приніс): use **-ши** (принісши)

---

### Verbs with Consonant Past Stems

Some verbs have consonant-final past stems, requiring **-ши**:

| Infinitive | Past Tense | Participle | Meaning |
|------------|------------|------------|---------|
| принести | приніс | приніс**ши** | having brought |
| привезти | привіз | привіз**ши** | having delivered |
| допомогти | допоміг | допоміг**ши** | having helped |
| пекти → спекти | спік | спік**ши** | having baked |
| могти → змогти | зміг | зміг**ши** | having been able |

---

### Reflexive Verbs

Reflexive perfective verbs keep **-ся/-сь**:

| Infinitive | Past | Participle | Meaning |
|------------|------|------------|---------|
| одягнутися | одягнувся | одягнувшись | having dressed |
| повернутися | повернувся | повернувшись | having returned |
| познайомитися | познайомився | познайомившись | having met (each other) |
| дізнатися | дізнався | дізнавшись | having found out |

> ⚠️ **Watch the Ending**
> The reflexive suffix is **-сь** after a vowel (познайомившись), but **-ся** after a consonant is also acceptable in some forms.

---

### Subject Agreement (Same Rule)

Just like imperfective participles, perfective participles must share the same subject as the main verb:

| ✅ CORRECT | ❌ INCORRECT |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Прочитавши** книгу, **він** заснув. | ~~Прочитавши книгу, **мені** стало сумно.~~ |
| *(Having read the book, HE fell asleep.)* | *(Having read the book, I got sad.)* |

> 📚 **Historical Note: Valuev Circular of 1863**
> 
> The Valuev Circular declared that "a distinct Ukrainian language never existed, doesn't exist, and cannot exist." Yet here we are, studying the elegant perfective participle — a grammatical structure that Russian borrowed from Church Slavonic, while Ukrainian developed it organically. Your mastery of these forms is living proof that Ukrainian thrives.

---

### Negation

To negate a perfective participle, add **не** directly before it:

| Positive | Negative |
|----------|----------|
| Зрозумівши питання... | **Не** зрозумівши питання... |
| *(Having understood the question...)* | *(Not having understood the question...)* |

**Examples:**
- Не дочекавшись відповіді, вона пішла. *(Not having waited for an answer, she left.)*
- Нічого не сказавши, він вийшов. *(Having said nothing, he left.)*

---

### Word Order

Perfective participle phrases typically come **before** the main clause (since the action happens first), but other positions are possible:

| Position | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Before (common)** | **Закінчивши обід**, вона пішла на роботу. |
| **After** | Вона пішла на роботу, **закінчивши обід**. |
| **Mid-sentence** | Вона, **закінчивши обід**, пішла на роботу. |

> 🎬 **Cinema Corner: Dovzhenko's Technique**
> 
> In Oleksandr Dovzhenko's classic films, perfective participles create a sense of epic time:
> - *Перемігши ворога, козаки повернулися до рідного краю.*
>   *(Having defeated the enemy, the Cossacks returned to their homeland.)*
> 
> This construction compresses entire battles into a single participial phrase, making room for the emotional return home.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

> ⚠️ **Mistake 1: Confusing Imperfective and Perfective**
> 
> | ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct | Meaning |
> |----------|-----------|---------|
> | Читаючи книгу, він заснув. | Прочитавши книгу, він заснув. | He finished the book, THEN fell asleep. |
> | Прочитавши книгу, він пив каву. | Читаючи книгу, він пив каву. | He read and drank at the SAME TIME. |
> 
> - Use **imperfective** for simultaneous actions
> - Use **perfective** for sequential actions (first X, then Y)

> ⚠️ **Mistake 2: Wrong Stem**
> 
> | ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
> |----------|-----------|
> | прийтивши | прийшо**вши** |
> | побачвши | побачи**вши** |
> 
> Always use the **past tense stem**: прийшов → прийшовши, побачив → побачивши.

## Stylistic Nuance: Bookish vs. Spoken

Perfective adverbial participles are the hallmark of **sophisticated Ukrainian**.

### 1. The Register Scale

| Structure | Register | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Clause (Коли...)** | Neutral / Spoken | **Коли я прочитав** книгу, я пішов спати. |
| **And (і)** | Simple / Spoken | Я **прочитав** книгу **і** пішов спати. |
| **Participle (-вши)** | Formal / Literary | **Прочитавши** книгу, я пішов спати. |

**When to use Participles:**
- **Essays & Reports:** Mandatory for concise, flowing text.
- **Formal Speech:** Presentations, debates, official statements.
- **Literature:** Narrative pacing.

**When NOT to use:**
- **Casual Chat:** "Прийшовши додому, я з'їв піцу" sounds a bit like "Having arrived at my domicile, I consumed a pizza." Use "Я прийшов і з'їв" instead.

### 2. The "Backgrounding" Function

Participles allow you to **background** less important information to highlight the **main event**.

- **Sentence:** *Він встав, одягнувся і вийшов.* (Three equal actions).
- **With Participle:** *Вставши і одягнувшись, він вийшов.*
    - **Foreground (Focus):** *Він вийшов.* (He left).
    - **Background (Context):** *Вставши і одягнувшись.* (Getting up and dressing).

Use participles to tell the reader: "This sequence of actions is just the setup; the real story happens in the main verb."

> 🧠 **Writer's Tip:**
> If you have a sentence with 3+ verbs linked by "і", turn the first one or two into participles. It instantly improves style.
> - *Bad:* Він відкрив двері, побачив її і здивувався.
> - *Good:* Відкривши двері і побачивши її, він здивувався.

---

## The Logic of Sequence: "Once" vs. "After"

While we often translate **-вши** as "Having done X", a better mental model might be **"Once X was done..."**.

This captures the **perfective** nature — the action is a completed block that serves as the foundation for the next action.

### The "Bridge" Metaphor
Imagine the participle as a bridge. You must cross (finish) the bridge completely before you can step onto the ground (main verb).
- *Перейшовши міст, ми побачили місто.*
- You cannot see the city *while* crossing (that would be *переходячи*). You must be *finished* crossing.

---

## Comparative Grammar: Participles vs. Adjectives

Do not confuse **Adverbial Participles** (Дієприслівники) with **Adjectival Participles** (Дієприкметники), which we will learn in C1.

| Feature | Adverbial Participle | Adjectival Participle |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Function** | Modifies the **VERB** (Action) | Modifies the **NOUN** (Object) |
| **Question** | When? How? Why? | Which one? What kind? |
| **Gender/Number** | **Invariant** (Never changes) | **Agrees** with noun |
| **Example** | *Прочитавши* (Having read) | *Прочитана* (The read book) |

> 🧩 **Quick Test:**
> - Can you replace it with "Having done X"? → Adverbial Participle (-вши).
> - Can you replace it with "The X-ed object"? → Adjectival Participle (-ний/-тий).

### The "Comma Rule" Rigidity

In English, we often skip commas. In Ukrainian, adverbial participle phrases are **always separated by commas**, no matter where they are.
- **Start:** *Зробивши каву, він сів.*
- **Middle:** *Він, зробивши каву, сів.*
- **End:** *Він сів, зробивши каву.*

There is NO exception for short phrases. Even a single word participle is separated:
- *Він, подумавши, погодився.* (Having thought, he agreed).

This creates a visual "breath" in the sentence, emphasizing the sequential logic.

---

## Cultural Insight: The Language of History

Ukrainian historical texts (Litopys) and folklore rely heavily on these forms to create rhythm.

> "*Подумавши, і погадавши, і шапку на бакир наклавши...*" (Thinking, and guessing, and tipping his cap...)

This rhythm — action, action, action, RESULT — is embedded in the Ukrainian storytelling DNA. It creates a sense of inevitability. The preparatory steps (participles) lead inexorably to the consequence (main verb).

---

## Etymology: The Origins of -вши

The suffix **-вши** is a fossilized form of the past tense active participle from Old East Slavic.
- In ancient times, there was a whole declension: *написавъ, написавша, написавше*.
- Over centuries, these forms lost their gender and case endings when used adverbially.
- The "v" sound (represented by **в**) is the same marker found in the past tense (*він чита**в***).
- The "**ши**" part relates to the ancient locative case ending, suggesting "in the state of having done".

So, **прочитавши** literally carries the ghost of "in the condition of having read".

---

## Semantic Deep Dive: Cause, Condition, or Time?

One of the most powerful features of perfective participles is their ambiguity. A single form can imply three different logical connections depending on context.

### 1. Temporal (When/After)
- *Прийшовши додому, він повечеряв.*
- **Logic:** Time sequence. First X, then Y.
- **Translation:** Having arrived home... / When he arrived home...

### 2. Causal (Because/Since)
- *Втомившись, вона сіла відпочити.*
- **Logic:** Cause and Effect. Why did she sit? Because she was tired.
- **Translation:** Being tired / Since she got tired...

### 3. Conditional (If/Once)
- *Не підготувавшись, ти не здаси екзамен.*
- **Logic:** Condition. If you don't prepare, the result will be failure.
- **Translation:** Unless you prepare / If you haven't prepared...

> 🧠 **Cognitive Shift:**
> Instead of worrying about WHICH one it is, embrace the efficiency. The Ukrainian speaker packs all three nuances into one word (*втомившись*), letting the listener deduce the logic. This makes the language incredibly dense and expressive.

# Підсумок

### Key Takeaways

1. **Perfective adverbial participles** express actions completed BEFORE the main verb action.

2. **Formation:**
   - Vowel past stem + **-вши** (прочитав → прочитавши)
   - Consonant past stem + **-ши** (приніс → принісши)
   - Reflexive: add **-сь/-ся** (повернувшись)

3. **Meaning:** Sequence (then), Cause (because), Condition (once/if).

4. **Key difference from imperfective:**
   - **-ючи/-ачи** = WHILE (simultaneous)
   - **-вши/-ши** = AFTER (sequential)

5. These constructions are especially common in journalistic and literary Ukrainian.

## true-false: Правила
> Decide if each statement is true or false.

1. Perfective adverbial participles express simultaneous actions.
   - [ ] True
   - [x] False
   > False. Perfective participles express SEQUENTIAL actions (first X, then Y).

2. "-вши" is added after vowel-final past stems, "-ши" after consonant-final past stems.
   - [x] True
   - [ ] False
   > True. прочитав → прочитавши; приніс → принісши.

3. "Прочитавши книгу, він заснув" means he fell asleep WHILE reading.
   - [ ] True
   - [x] False
   > False. He finished reading FIRST, then fell asleep.

4. Perfective participles can express cause (because/since).
   - [x] True
   - [ ] False
   > True. E.g., "Втомившись, вона лягла спати" = Having gotten tired (= because she was tired), she went to bed.

5. "Прийшовши" comes from "приходити."
   - [ ] True
   - [x] False
   > False. "Прийшовши" comes from PERFECTIVE "прийти" (прийшов).

6. You can use "не" before a perfective participle.
   - [x] True
   - [ ] False
   > True. E.g., "Не зрозумівши питання..." = Not having understood...

7. Perfective participles are formed from the infinitive stem.
   - [ ] True
   - [x] False
   > False. They're formed from the PAST TENSE stem.

8. "Написати → написавши" is correct.
   - [x] True
   - [ ] False
   > True. написав → написавши.

9. Reflexive perfective participles drop the -ся/-сь suffix.
   - [ ] True
   - [x] False
   > False. They KEEP it: повернувся → повернувшись.

10. "Подумаючи" is a valid perfective participle form.
    - [ ] True
    - [x] False
    > False. "Подумати" is perfective; participle = подумавши. There's no *подумаючи.

11. Perfective participle phrases typically come BEFORE the main clause.
    - [x] True
    - [ ] False
    > True. Since the action happens first, it naturally comes first in the sentence.

12. "Прочитавши" and "читаючи" are interchangeable.
    - [ ] True
    - [x] False
    > False. They have different meanings: "having read" vs. "while reading."

13. "Принісши" is formed from "принести."
    - [x] True
    - [ ] False
    > True. приніс → принісши.

14. The main verb and participle must have the same subject.
    - [x] True
    - [ ] False
    > True. Different subjects create an ungrammatical sentence.

# Підсумок

У цьому модулі ви опанували **доконані дієприслівники** — граматичний інструмент для вираження послідовності завершених дій. Ці форми дозволяють описати те, що сталося ДО головної дії, створюючи елегантні, лаконічні речення.

**Remember:**
- Vowel stem + **-вши** (прочитав → прочитавши)
- Consonant stem + **-ши** (приніс → принісши)
- Reflexive verbs keep **-сь/-ся** (повернувшись)
- Key semantic roles: sequence, cause, condition

**Compare with Module 36:**
- **-ючи/-ачи** (недок.) = WHILE doing (simultaneous)
- **-вши/-ши** (док.) = HAVING DONE (sequential)

In the next module, you'll learn about **active participles** — forms like "читаючий" (the reading one) and when to avoid them in natural Ukrainian speech!
