# LLM Review: Як говорити про граматику (B1 M01)

## 1. Coherence & Flow

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: The module follows a logical progression from "Why learn this?" to Parts of Speech, Cases, and Basic Terms. Transitions are smooth, and the narrative hook (native environment) is strong.

## 2. Relevance & Engagement

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Directly addresses the learner's immediate need (understanding grammar explanations in Ukrainian). The "Real World" box adds practical context.

## 3. Educational Value

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Covers all essential metalanguage required for B1. Explanations are clear and aimed at the right level.

## 4. Language Quality (English)

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: English instruction is clear, professional, and engaging. No awkward phrasings.

## 5. Pedagogy & Scaffolding

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Uses PPP effectively. Concepts are introduced with examples, then practiced. The specific focus on "recognizing patterns" is highly pedagogical.

## 6. Immersion & Naturalness

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Ukrainian examples are natural. Key terms are consistently used in Ukrainian. Dialogues feel authentic for the level.

## 7. Activities

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Diverse activity set (16 activities). Complexity was adjusted to meet B1 standards (8-15 word prompts). Reading comprehension quiz effectively tests the core skill.

## 8. Richness & Depth

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Exceeds word count targets (2000+ words). Includes cultural context (naming cases) and mnemonic devices.

## 9. Humanity & Voice

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Tone is encouraging and explicitly human ("Let's be honest," "You've been using..."). Avoids robotic lecturing.

## 10. LLM Fingerprint

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: No "In conclusion" or "delve". Structure is bespoke to the curriculum template.

## 11. Linguistic Accuracy

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Ukrainian grammar terms are correct. Examples (book declension) are accurate. Euphony rules (у/в) observed.

## Final Verdict

PASS
