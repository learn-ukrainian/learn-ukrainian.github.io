# LLM Review: B1 Module 05 - Готові до занурення

## Summary

**Reviewer:** Gemini Agent 2
**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Version:** 1.0 (Audit Pass)

Module 05 serves as the critical "checkpoint" and "bridge" module transitioning learners from English-scaffolded instruction (M01-M04) to full Ukrainian immersion (M06+). It successfully synthesizes the metalanguage acquired in the previous modules and tests reading comprehension of authentic grammar texts.

## Strengths

1.  **Strategic Function**: Ideally positioned as a "Graduation Ceremony" for the Bridge Phase. The "Presentation" section effectively frames the importance of metalanguage.
2.  **Pedagogical Density**: The module is packed with 25 activities, providing intense drill and practice on key terms (parts of speech, cases, aspect).
3.  **Authentic Tasks**: The "Reading Grammar Text" activity simulates the real-world challenge of reading a Ukrainian textbook, which is directly aligned with the module's "Immersion Readiness" goal.
4.  **Cultural integration**: The inclusion of linguistic history (Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv schools) adds depth and pride to the learning of grammar terms.

## Areas for Improvement

1.  **Brevity**: While dense in activities, the prose sections are concise. This is acceptable for a review checkpoints, but instructors should ensure learners don't rush through the "Presentation" without absorbing the cultural context.
2.  **Writing Practice**: The module relies heavily on quizzes. The removal of the long essay (due to technical constraints) puts more burden on the "Mini-Dialogues" for production practice. Future iterations could re-introduce a structured writing task if density rules allow.

## Verification

- **Audit Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Word Count**: ~1200 words (Targets met)
- **Activity Density**: High (25 activities)
- **Naturalness**: 9/10 (High - Metalanguage focus)

## Conclusion

Module 05 is ready for production. It robustly verifies that learners possess the necessary vocabulary ("вид", "відмінок", "речення") to survive in a Ukrainian-only learning environment starting from Module 06.
