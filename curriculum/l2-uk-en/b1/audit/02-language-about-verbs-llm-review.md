# LLM Review: Мова про дієслова (B1 M02)

## 1. Coherence & Flow

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Logical progression from Aspect -> Tense -> Negation -> Forms. Each section builds on the previous one. Revisions to headers clarified the structure significantly.

## 2. Relevance & Engagement

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: "Why This Module Matters" clearly justifies the metalanguage focus. "Pop Culture Moments" (S.T.A.L.K.E.R. reference) adds excellent contemporary relevance.

## 3. Educational Value

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Clarifies the most confusing part of Ukrainian grammar (Aspect) for B1 learners using clear, standard terminology. The "Real World" boxes help decode textbook instructions.

## 4. Language Quality (English)

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Explanations are crisp. The distinction between "process" and "result" is handled with precision.

## 5. Pedagogy & Scaffolding

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: PPP approach is evident. Concepts are introduced with definitions, then examples, then dialogues. "Action Concepts" section provides necessary semantic scaffolding.

## 6. Immersion & Naturalness

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Ukrainian terminology is prioritized. Dialogues feel natural for a metalanguage focused module.

## 7. Activities

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: diverse mix (12 activities). Pattern recognition and translation tasks are highly relevant for a bridge module.

## 8. Richness & Depth

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Word count (~1800 words) is well above target. Includes nuanced topics like negation influence on aspect.

## 9. Humanity & Voice

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Tone is helpful and knowing ("When you pick up a grammar book..."). S.T.A.L.K.E.R. reference shows cultural awareness beyond stereotypes.

## 10. LLM Fingerprint

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Structure is rigid and curriculum-specific. No generic fluff.

## 11. Linguistic Accuracy

SCORE: 10/10
Justification: Aspect pairs and explanations are linguistically accurate. Terminology (синтетична vs складна) is precise and standard.

## Final Verdict

PASS
