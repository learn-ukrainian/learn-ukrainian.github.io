## Overview

The C1 curriculum is the path to **mastery**. It shifts focus from "learning the language" to "using the language" for high-level academic, professional, and analytical purposes.

**Key Shifts:**
1.  **Specialization Offloaded:** Specific domains (Law, Med, IT) are moved to [SPECIALIZATION-TRACKS.md](../SPECIALIZATION-TRACKS.md). The Core C1 covers *universal* professional skills.
2.  **Analysis First:** Academic and stylistic skills are built *before* tackling complex literature.
3.  **Sociolinguistic Awareness:** Understanding dialects, Surzhyk, and language policy is essential for C1 fluency.
