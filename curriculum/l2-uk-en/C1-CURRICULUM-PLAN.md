## Notes

1. **Literature is now at the END** - Based on teacher feedback, learners need academic and analytical skills BEFORE tackling literary texts.

2. **History foundation in B2** - Modules 211-232 cover Ukrainian history, providing cultural context for literature. Learners understand Holodomor, Executed Renaissance, etc. BEFORE reading the literature.

3. **Розстріляне відродження** (Executed Renaissance) - the generation of Ukrainian writers killed by Stalin in the 1930s. Now has proper historical context from B2.

4. **Dialects** are for recognition/comprehension, not production. Learners should understand speakers from different regions.

5. **Professional fields** - not all learners need all fields. These could be optional/elective tracks in implementation.

6. **Pedagogical sequence**: History (B2) → Academic Skills → Professional Skills → Stylistics → Literature = optimal preparation for literary appreciation
