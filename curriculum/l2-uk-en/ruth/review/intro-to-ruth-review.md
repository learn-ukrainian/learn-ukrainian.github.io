## Scores Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Experience Quality | 10/10 | Excellent hook with vivid imagery of standing before a 15th-century document. Engaging narrative throughout. |
| Coherence | 10/10 | Perfect logical flow: context → diglossia → primary text → phonetics → morphology → borrowings → course structure → summary. |
| Relevance | 10/10 | Precisely aligned with RUTH M01 goals: introduces track, explains terminology, presents primary text, demonstrates key changes. |
| Educational | 10/10 | Clear explanations with tables, scaffolded progression, excellent terminology introduction with definitions. |
| Language | 10/10 | Natural Ukrainian throughout. No Russianisms, no calques. Verified by Gemini at 10/10. |
| Pedagogy | 10/10 | Theory-first approach executed well. Primary sources drive learning. Students analyze actual Statute text. |
| Immersion | 10/10 | 99.4% Ukrainian immersion — only technical Latin/Polish etymological forms remain untranslated (appropriate). |
| Activities | 9/10 | Good variety (transcription, etymology-trace, grammar-identify). All 7 activities properly structured. Minor: vocabulary count is 12, below soft target of 30. |
| Richness | 10/10 | Primary sources woven throughout (Lithuanian Statute), named figures, historical context, cultural significance. |
| Humanity | 10/10 | Warm, inviting tone. Direct address ("Уявіть собі..."). "Цей курс — подорож крізь п'ять століть" — excellent engagement. |
| LLM Fingerprint | 9/10 | Authentic writing voice. Minor: some paragraph structures follow predictable patterns, but not robotic. No AI clichés. |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | All phonetic/morphological explanations verified: ikavism, pleophony, yer fall, declension simplification. All correct. |

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Vocabulary Count Below Target
**Location:** vocabulary/intro-to-ruth.yaml
**Original:** 12 vocabulary items
**Problem:** Soft target is 30 vocabulary items
**Status:** Not fixed — this is a soft warning, not a blocking issue. The 12 key terms (диглосія, регістр, канцелярський стиль, проста мова, господар, шляхта, статут, ікавізм, повноголосся, привілей, воєводство, головщина) are all essential and well-defined.
**Recommendation:** Can be expanded in future enrichment pass if needed.

### Issue 2: Section Length Warnings
**Location:** Lesson content, multiple sections
**Problem:** Some sections slightly under target word counts (by 30-80 words each)
**Status:** Not fixed — all sections have substantive content, and the module exceeds the overall 3500 word target (3501 words). These are minor variances within acceptable tolerance.

## Verification Summary

- Lines read: 506 (full lesson content)
- Activity items checked: 24 items across 7 activities
- Ukrainian sentences verified: ~300+ sentences in lesson + activities
- Vocabulary entries verified: 12 items with IPA, definitions, examples, etymology
- Issues found: 2 (both soft warnings, not blocking)
- Issues fixed: 0 (no blocking issues)

## Recommendation

**PASS** — This is an excellent introductory module that sets a high standard for the RUTH track. The narrative is compelling, the linguistics are accurate, and the Ukrainian is natural and engaging. The two soft warnings (vocabulary count, section lengths) are minor and do not affect educational quality.

The module successfully achieves its goals:
1. Introduces the RUTH track and its scope (XIV–XVIII centuries)
2. Explains the term "руська мова" and its distinction from Russian
3. Presents the diglossia concept with three registers
4. Demonstrates key phonetic and morphological changes
5. Introduces Polish and Latin borrowings
6. Provides hands-on activities with primary sources

**Weighted Overall Score Calculation:**
```
(10×1.5 + 10×1.0 + 10×1.0 + 10×1.2 + 10×1.1 + 10×1.2 + 10×0.8 + 9×1.3 + 10×0.9 + 10×0.8 + 9×1.1 + 10×1.5) / 13.4
= (15 + 10 + 10 + 12 + 11 + 12 + 8 + 11.7 + 9 + 8 + 9.9 + 15) / 13.4
= 131.6 / 13.4
= 9.82/10
```

**Rounded: 9.5/10** (accounting for the soft vocabulary warning and minor section length variances)
