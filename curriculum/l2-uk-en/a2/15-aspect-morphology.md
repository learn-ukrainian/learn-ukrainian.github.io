## Warm-up

**Ласкаво просимо до глибшого вивчення аспектних пар!**

Now that you understand aspect conceptually and can use it in past and future tenses, let's go deeper into HOW aspect pairs are formed. Understanding the patterns will help you predict aspects for new verbs you encounter — a crucial skill for expanding your vocabulary efficiently.

**Why Pattern Recognition Matters:**

When you learn a new verb in Ukrainian, you don't just learn one word — you potentially learn two or more related verbs. If you meet "читати" (to read), you can predict that adding "про-" will give you "прочитати" (to read through/finish). This predictability is a huge advantage for vocabulary building.

However, you need to understand the patterns to make these predictions accurately. Not all prefixes work the same way, and some verb pairs don't follow any pattern at all — they simply use completely different words (called "suppletive pairs").

**The Three Main Formation Patterns:**

1. **Prefixation** — The most common method. Adding prefixes like про-, на-, з-, по-, ви- to an imperfective verb creates its perfective counterpart.

2. **Suffixation** — Some pairs differ by having or removing -ва-/-ува- in the imperfective form (давати → дати).

3. **Suppletive Pairs** — A small number of common verbs use completely different roots for different aspects (говорити → сказати, брати → взяти). These must be memorized as pairs.

## Presentation

## Prefixation: The Most Common Pattern

Most perfective verbs are formed by adding a prefix to the imperfective base. Here are the main patterns:

### Prefix: про- (through, completion)

| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| читати | **про**читати | to read (through) |
| слухати | **про**слухати | to listen (to completion) |
| лежати | **про**лежати | to lie (for a duration) |

**Meaning:** "про-" often suggests going through something completely.

### Prefix: на- (writing/filling)

| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| писати | **на**писати | to write |
| малювати | **на**малювати | to draw/paint |
| вчити | **на**вчити | to teach (to completion) |

**Meaning:** "на-" often relates to creating something on a surface.

### Prefix: з-/с- (completion)

| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| робити | **з**робити | to do/make |
| їсти | **з**'їсти | to eat up |
| ламати | **з**ламати | to break |

**Meaning:** "з-" is a general completion marker.

> 💡 **Spelling Rule**
>
> The prefix "з-" becomes "с-" before voiceless consonants: сказати (not "зказати"), створити (not "зтворити").

### Prefix: по- (beginning or brief action)

| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| бачити | **по**бачити | to see (catch sight of) |
| чути | **по**чути | to hear (catch sound of) |
| любити | **по**любити | to fall in love |

**Meaning:** "по-" can mark the start of a state or a brief action.

### Prefix: ви- (out, mastery)

| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| вчити | **ви**вчити | to learn/master |
| пити | **ви**пити | to drink up |
| ходити | **ви**йти | to go out |

**Meaning:** "ви-" often means "out" or complete mastery.

> 📜 **Pattern Recognition Tip**
>
> When you see a verb with a prefix, it's usually perfective. The underlying stem (without prefix) is usually imperfective. Exception: some prefixed verbs have their own imperfective forms!

## Suffixation Patterns

Some aspect pairs change their suffix, typically involving -ва- or -ува-. This pattern is the reverse of prefixation — here, the imperfective is the "longer" form.

| Imperfective | Perfective | Pattern |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| давати | дати | -ва- removal |
| вставати | встати | -ва- removal |
| відпочивати | відпочити | -ва- removal |
| показувати | показати | -ува- removal |

**The pattern:** Imperfective has -ва- or -ува-; perfective doesn't.

**Why this pattern exists:**
When prefixed perfective verbs need imperfective counterparts, Ukrainian often adds -ва- or -ува- to create the imperfective. This is called "secondary imperfectivization" and is extremely common with prefixed verbs.

For example: показати — perfective → показувати — imperfective.

> [!tip] Easy Recognition
> If a verb ends in -вати or -увати, it's almost always imperfective. Remove the suffix, and you often get the perfective!

## Suppletive Pairs (Different Roots)

Some aspect pairs use completely different words. You must memorize these:

| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| говорити | сказати | to say/speak |
| брати | взяти | to take |
| класти | покласти | to put |
| шукати | знайти | to look for | find |

**Meaning:** These pairs often have slightly different nuances — говорити (process of speaking) vs. сказати (saying something specific). Similarly, шукати means to look for or search, while знайти means specifically to find — the successful completion of searching.

**Learning tip:** Prioritize memorizing these suppletive pairs since they are among the most frequently used verbs in everyday Ukrainian conversation.

## Cultural Insight

## Aspect and Word Formation

Understanding aspect patterns helps you learn vocabulary faster. When you encounter a new verb, ask:

1. **Does it have a prefix?** → Probably perfective
2. **Does it have -ва-/-ува-?** → Probably imperfective
3. **What's the basic meaning?** → Look for the pair!

**Example:** You see "показувати" for the first time.
- Has -ува- suffix → imperfective
- Remove suffix → показ- → perfective: показати

> 🔍 **Prefixes Can Change Meaning!**
>
> Be careful: prefixes don't just perfectivize — they can change meaning entirely:
> - писати (to write) → написати (to write/complete)
> - писати (to write) → переписати (to rewrite)
> - писати (to write) → підписати (to sign)
> Each prefixed verb has its OWN imperfective: переписувати, підписувати.

## Practice

## Practice: Identify the Pattern

For each aspect pair below, identify how the perfective is formed:

1. **читати → прочитати** = про- prefix (completion)
2. **писати → написати** = на- prefix (creating)
3. **давати → дати** = -ва- removal (suffix loss)
4. **бачити → побачити** = по- prefix (moment of seeing)
5. **говорити → сказати** = suppletive (different roots)

**Additional Practice:**

Now try these more challenging pairs. What pattern does each use?

6. **робити → зробити** = ? (Answer: з- prefix)
7. **вчити → вивчити** = ? (Answer: ви- prefix for mastery)
8. **вставати → встати** = ? (Answer: -ва- removal)
9. **показувати → показати** = ? (Answer: -ува- removal)
10. **брати → взяти** = ? (Answer: suppletive — different roots)

**Learning Strategy:**
When you encounter a new verb, follow this decision tree:

1. Does it have a prefix? → Probably perfective. Look for the unprefixed imperfective.
2. Does it have -ва-/-ува-? → Probably imperfective. Remove suffix for perfective.
3. Neither? → Check if it's a suppletive pair (memorize these separately).

# Summary

## What You Learned

This module explored how aspect pairs are formed in Ukrainian — essential knowledge for vocabulary building and accurate verb usage.

**The Big Picture:**
Ukrainian aspect is built into the verb system at a deep level. Understanding how perfective verbs are formed from imperfective ones (or vice versa) gives you the power to predict new vocabulary and recognize related verbs as members of the same "aspect family."

**The Three Formation Patterns:**

| Pattern | Description | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Prefixation** | Add prefix to imperfective | читати → прочитати, писати → написати |
| **Suffixation** | Remove -ва-/-ува- | давати → дати, вставати → встати |
| **Suppletive** | Different roots entirely | говорити → сказати, брати → взяти |

**Key Prefixes and Their Meanings:**

| Prefix | Core meaning | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| про- | through, to completion | прочитати (read through) |
| на- | writing, creating | написати (write out) |
| з-/с- | completion, together | зробити (complete doing) |
| по- | beginning, brief action | побачити (catch sight of) |
| ви- | out, mastery | вивчити (master, learn) |

**Recognition Tips:**
- Prefix on a verb usually indicates perfective aspect
- The suffix -ва- or -ува- usually indicates imperfective aspect
- Same root with different prefixes = related but different verbs with different meanings
- Suppletive pairs are few but very common — prioritize memorizing them

**Important Warning:**
Adding different prefixes to the same root creates different perfective verbs with related but distinct meanings. For example: написати (to write), переписати (to rewrite), підписати (to sign). Each of these has its OWN imperfective form!

> - **про-**: читати → прочитати (закінчити читання)
> - **на-**: писати → написати (закінчити писання)
> - **з-/с-**: робити → зробити (закінчити роботу)
> - **по-**: бачити → побачити (побачити щось нове)
