## Introduction

**Ласкаво просимо до майбутнього часу!**

Welcome to future tense with aspect! You've learned that Ukrainian verbs come in aspect pairs and how to use them in past tense. Now let's learn how aspect works in the future — it's actually even more dramatic here because the two aspects have completely different formations!

In English, we use «will + verb» for almost everything in the future. But Ukrainian speakers make a fundamental choice every time they talk about future actions: are they talking about a process that will happen, or a result that will be achieved? This choice determines not just meaning but the entire grammatical structure of the sentence.

**Why this matters for fluency:**
When you master both future formations, you can express subtle differences in meaning that English cannot easily capture. You can distinguish between:
- «I will be reading tomorrow»
- «I will read/finish this book tomorrow»

Native speakers make this distinction constantly, and learning to do the same will dramatically improve your ability to communicate naturally.

**Key insight:** Ukrainian has TWO different ways to form future tense, depending on the aspect:
- **Imperfective future:** буду + infinitive (will be doing — process focus)
- **Perfective future:** conjugated verb (will do/finish — result focus)

This is a crucial distinction that doesn't exist in English! By the end of this module, you'll be able to make plans, express intentions, and give promises with the appropriate level of commitment.

> 💡 **Пам'ятайте!**
>
> Недоконаний майбутній час (буду + інфінітив) — це процес. Доконаний майбутній час (змінене дієслово) — це результат. Цей вибір змінює значення!

## Presentation

## Practice

Choose the correct future form:

1. **I will read every day.** (habit)
   → Я **буду читати** щодня. (impf.)

2. **I will finish this book tomorrow.**
   → Я **прочитаю** цю книгу завтра. (perf.)

3. **She will be working all week.** (duration)
   → Вона **буде працювати** цілий тиждень. (impf.)

4. **He will write the letter.** (promise)
   → Він **напише** листа. (perf.)

## Two Types of Future

Unlike English, which uses «will + verb» for everything, Ukrainian has completely different future formations based on aspect.

## Imperfective Future: буду + Infinitive

For imperfective verbs, the future is formed with the auxiliary verb **бути** + infinitive:

| Person | Formation | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| я | буду + inf. | буду читати |
| ти | будеш + inf. | будеш читати |
| він/вона | буде + inf. | буде читати |
| ми | будемо + inf. | будемо читати |
| ви | будете + inf. | будете читати |
| вони | будуть + inf. | будуть читати |

**Usage:** Ongoing or repeated future actions
- Я **буду читати** увечері. (I will be reading in the evening.)
- Вона **буде працювати** завтра. (She will be working tomorrow.)

> 💡 **This is Like English Progressive!**
>
> «Буду читати» is similar to «I will be reading» — it emphasizes the process or duration of the future action.

## Perfective Future: Conjugated Verb

For perfective verbs, the future is formed by simply conjugating the verb in its «present tense» form — but because it's perfective, it refers to the future!

| Person | прочитати | написати | зробити |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| я | прочитаю | напишу | зроблю |
| ти | прочитаєш | напишеш | зробиш |
| він/вона | прочитає | напише | зробить |
| ми | прочитаємо | напишемо | зробимо |
| ви | прочитаєте | напишете | зробите |
| вони | прочитають | напишуть | зроблять |

**Usage:** Completed future actions
- Я **прочитаю** цю книгу. (I will read/finish this book.)
- Вона **напише** листа. (She will write the letter.)

> 📜 **Why Perfective «Present» = Future**
>
> Perfective verbs can't have true present tense because they describe completed actions — and you can't complete something that's happening right now! So their «present» conjugation always refers to future completion.

## Comparing the Two Futures

Here's the same verb pair in both future forms:

| Aspect | Future | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Impf. | буду читати | will be reading (process) |
| Perf. | прочитаю | will read/finish (result) |
| Impf. | буду писати | will be writing (process) |
| Perf. | напишу | will write/finish (result) |
| Impf. | буду робити | will be doing (process) |
| Perf. | зроблю | will do/finish (result) |

> [!tip] Simple Rule
> **Making plans about DOING something:** буду + infinitive
> **Promising to COMPLETE something:** perfective form

## Time Expressions with Future Tense

Certain time expressions often appear with specific aspects:

**With Imperfective:**
- цілий день — all day («Я буду працювати цілий день.»)
- весь час — all the time («Он буде весь час говорити.»)
- щодня — every day («Ми будемо читати щодня.»)

**With Perfective:**
- завтра — tomorrow («Я прочитаю завтра.»)
- наступного тижня — next week («Ми приїдемо наступного тижня.»)
- о третій годині — at three o'clock («Я закінчу о третій.»)

Understanding which time expressions go with which aspect will help you sound more natural when talking about future plans.

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> In everyday Ukrainian conversation, people switch between aspects constantly. For example, when making weekend plans: «Завтра я **буду прибирати** (will be cleaning — process), а потім **приготую** вечерю (will cook — result).» Notice how the speaker uses imperfective for the ongoing task and perfective for the completed dish!

## Cultural Insight

## Promises and Intentions

In Ukrainian culture, using perfective future often carries more commitment — it's like promising that you WILL complete the action.

**Weaker commitment (process-focused):**
- Я буду намагатися. (I will be trying.)
- Я буду працювати над цим. (I will be working on this.)

**Stronger commitment (result-focused):**
- Я зроблю це! (I will do it!)
- Я напишу тобі! (I will write to you!)

**Real-life example:**
- «Ти будеш вчити українську?» → «Так, буду.» (Yes, I will be studying — ongoing commitment)
- «Ти вивчиш цей урок?» → «Так, вивчу!» (Yes, I will learn it! — promise to complete)

> 🔍 **Cultural Note**
>
> When making promises, Ukrainians prefer perfective: «Я зроблю» sounds more reliable than «Я буду робити.»

> 📜 **Українська мудрість**
>
> «Обіцяти — не значить одружитися.» Ця приказка нагадує, що обіцянки потрібно виконувати! Тому, коли ви використовуєте доконаний вид («Я зроблю!»), ви берете на себе відповідальність.
