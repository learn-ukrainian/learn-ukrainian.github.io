## Presentation

## Comparing Products

When shopping, you'll constantly compare items. Here are key phrases:

### Basic Comparisons

- Цей **кращий**, але **дорожчий**. (This one is better, but more expensive.)
- Той **дешевший** за цей. (That one is cheaper than this one.)
- Який **найдешевший**? (Which is the cheapest?)
- Мені **більше подобається** червоний. (I like the red one more.)

When using these phrases, remember that adjectives like **кращий** (better) and **дорожчий** (more expensive) must agree in gender and number with the noun you are describing. If you are comparing two feminine items, you would use **краща** and **дорожча**. This grammatical agreement ensures that your sentences sound natural to native speakers.

### Asking About Options

- Що ви **порекомендуєте**? (What do you recommend?)
- Є щось **краще**? (Is there something better?)
- Є щось **дешевше**? (Is there something cheaper?)
- Яка **різниця** між ними? (What's the difference between them?)

Asking for a recommendation (**рекомендація**) is a smart strategy because it shifts the responsibility of choosing onto the expert (the seller). They will often point you toward the most popular or highest quality items currently in stock.

> 💡 **Shopping Tip**
>
> Ukrainians appreciate when you ask for advice! "Що ви порекомендуєте?" is a great way to start a conversation with a shop assistant.

## Negotiation Phrases

In some contexts (markets, small shops), negotiation is possible:

### Asking for Discounts

- Чи можна **дешевше**? (Can it be cheaper?)
- Чи є **знижка**? (Is there a discount?)
- Якщо візьму два, буде **дешевше**? (If I take two, will it be cheaper?)

### Expressing Hesitation

- Це **занадто** дорого. (This is too expensive.)
- Я **подумаю**. (I'll think about it.)
- Можливо, **повернуся**. (Maybe I'll come back.)

In Ukrainian culture, saying "I'll think about it" (**Я подумаю**) is a very common and polite way to leave a negotiation without making a purchase. It allows both parties to save face. If you are at a market and the price is truly too high, don't be afraid to use the word **занадто** (too/excessively) to express your hesitation clearly.

> 📜 **Cultural Note**
>
> Negotiation is common at markets (ринок, базар) but unusual in regular stores and supermarkets. Always be polite when asking for discounts!

## Making Decisions

### Positive Decision

- Я **візьму** цей. (I'll take this one.)
- **Беру**! (I'll take it!)
- Це мені **підходить**. (This suits me.)

### Negative Decision

- Дякую, **не потрібно**. (Thank you, not needed.)
- Я **ще подумаю**. (I'll still think about it.)
- Мені не **підходить**. (It doesn't suit me.)

The verb **підходити** (to suit/to fit) is very versatile in shopping. You can use it to talk about the price, the style, or even the physical fit of a piece of clothing. If something doesn't work for you, simply adding **не** (not) before the verb makes your refusal clear but remaining respectful to the seller.

> [!tip] Polite Refusal
> "Дякую, я подумаю" (Thank you, I'll think about it) is a polite way to decline without directly saying "no."

## Cultural Insight

## Shopping in Ukraine

Ukrainian shopping culture varies by location:

**Supermarkets (супермаркет):**
- Fixed prices, no negotiation
- Self-service
- Common in cities

**Markets (ринок, базар):**
- Fresh produce, clothes, goods
- Negotiation possible
- Cash preferred

**Small shops (магазин, крамниця):**
- Personal service
- May have loyalty discounts
- Good for local products

## Shopping Strategies

### 1. The Art of Polite Negotiation

Negotiation (**торг**) is an art form in Ukrainian markets. It's not just about saving money; it's social interaction. In Ukraine, the process of bargaining is seen as a sign of mutual respect and interest in the product. It's perfectly normal to spend several minutes discussing the merits of a specific item before agreeing on a final price.
- **Start soft:** "Чи це остаточна ціна?" (Is this the final price?)
- **Point out flaws (gently):** "Але тут маленька пляма..." (But there is a small spot here...)
- **Walk away (theatre):** "Добре, я ще пройдуся..." (Okay, I'll walk around a bit more...)

### 2. Genitive Plural: Weighing Your Options

When buying food, you often count or weigh things. This triggers the **Genitive Case** (often Plural).
- **1 кілограм** (Nominative)
- **2, 3, 4 кілограми** (Nominative Plural)
- **5+ кілограмів** (Genitive Plural)

> [!note] Grammar Check
> Technically, "кілограм" has a zero ending in Genitive Plural in some dialects (5 кілограм), but standard literary Ukrainian prefers **кілограмів**.
> - 200 **грамів** (grams)
> - 5 **літрів** (liters)
> - 10 **гривень** (hryvnias)

### 3. Payment Vocabulary

- **Готівка** (Cash) — King of the market.
- **Карта** (Card) — Standard in shops.
- **Решта** (Change) — "У вас є решта з 500?" (Do you have change from 500?)
- **Чек** (Receipt) — "Ваш чек, будь ласка." (Your receipt, please.)

Understanding these payment terms is crucial because while city supermarkets almost always accept contact-less payments, many older bazar sellers still rely exclusively on physical cash transactions.

## Cultural Insight

## The Soul of the "Bazar"

The Ukrainian **базар** (market) is more than a store; it's a community hub.
- **Postiynyy Kliyent (Regular Customer):** The goal is to become a "постійний клієнт". Once a seller knows you, they will pick the best tomatoes for you, hide the freshest meat under the counter for you, and give you discounts without asking.
- **Taste it!** Sellers will often offer: "Спробуйте!" (Taste it!). Refusing can sometimes be seen as rude if you are genuinely interested.
- **Morning Glory:** The best produce is sold by 8-9 AM. If you arrive at noon, you get leftovers.

> 🧠 **Myth: "No Price Tags means Tourist Trap"**
>
> In many Western countries, no price tag is a red flag. In a Ukrainian bazar, it just means the price fluctuates based on supply, time of day, and your negotiation skills! Always ask "По чому?" (How much? - colloquial) or "Скільки коштує?". This transparency in verbal price checks is an expected part of the interaction.

> 🎭 **Roleplay Idea**
>
> Imagine you have 500 hryvnias. You need to buy vegetables for Borscht (potatoes, beets, carrots, cabbage, onion) and meat. Write down a shopping list and "negotiate" with a partner to see if you can fit it all in your budget!

## Shopping for Clothes vs. Food

| Feature | Clothes Shop | Food Market |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Service** | "Can I help you?" leads to fitting room. | "Taste this!" leads to buying. |
| **Space** | Personal space respected. | Crowded, pushy, lively. |
| **Payment** | Card/Phone (NFC). | Cash (mostly), card-to-card transfer. |

> [!tip] "Paket"
> "Пакет потрібен?" (Do you need a bag?) is the most common phrase you will hear at any checkout. Ukrainians often carry their own reusable eco-bags.

> [!tip] Sizes
> Ukraine uses European shoe sizes (36, 37, 38...). Clothing sizes are also different from US/UK (S/M/L are common, but numbers like 44, 46, 48 are standard).
