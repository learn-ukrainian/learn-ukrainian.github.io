### Block Strengths

2. **Outstanding cultural integration** - Authentic Ukrainian contexts throughout
3. **Grammar clarity** - Complex topics explained accessibly without oversimplification
4. **Activity diversity** - Good mix of receptive and productive exercises
5. **Practical vocabulary** - Highly usable in real-world situations

### Block Weaknesses
1. **Minor:** Module numbering inconsistency between filenames and frontmatter (cosmetic issue)
2. ~~**Minor:** Checkpoint module (24) could have more integrated scenario exercises~~ **FIXED**

### Recommendations
1. ✅ **No major fixes required** - This block is production-ready
2. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Added integrated scenarios in Module 24 combining aspect, comparison, and conditional
3. The subordinate clause sequence (25-32) is well-designed with logical progression

### Fixes Applied (2025-12-19)
| Module | Issue | Fix Applied |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 24 | Needed more integrated scenarios | Added "Planning a Trip" dialogue + comprehension questions |
| 24 | Cloze format incorrect | Fixed inline options format |

### Conclusion
This is an exceptionally strong block of modules. The transition from numerals (21) through conditionals (22) to the subordinate clause sequence (25-30) is pedagogically sound. Cultural integration is authentic and enriching. Activities are varied and well-targeted for A2 level. Ready for production.
