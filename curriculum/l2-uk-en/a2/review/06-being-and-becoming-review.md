# Module 06: Being and Becoming - Content Review

**Overall Score:** 4.5/5

### Scores Breakdown
- Coherence: 5/5 - Excellent organization: бути → стати → працювати progression
- Relevance: 5/5 - Perfect match between title and content, all examples on-topic
- Educational: 4/5 - Strong explanations, good inductive discovery patterns
- Language: 4/5 - Clear writing, occasional minor redundancy in tables
- Word Salad: No

### Strengths
- Clear three-part structure (бути, стати, працювати) makes the grammar patterns easy to follow
- Excellent use of comparison tables showing tense differences (present/past/future)
- Strong cultural insight section about feminine profession forms dispelling myths
- Good variety of engagement boxes (Did You Know, History Bite, Myth Buster, Real World)
- Reading passage effectively demonstrates all three verbs in context

### Issues
- **[True-False]** Item 12 was incorrectly marked as false when the statement was actually true - FIXED
- **[Redundancy]** The verb conjugation table for стати appears twice (lines 93-103 and implicitly in examples)

### Examples

> "Wait — this IS true! Письменник → письменниця."

- Issue: Confusingly worded - marked as false but explanation says it's true
- Fix: Changed to `[x]` and updated explanation to "Correct!" - FIXED

### Recommendation
**PASS** - High quality module with clear explanations and well-structured activities

### Action Items
1. Fix true-false item 12 marking [SAFE] - FIXED
2. Consider consolidating verb conjugation tables [RISKY] - SKIPPED (minor)
