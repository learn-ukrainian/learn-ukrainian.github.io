## Scores Breakdown

### Coherence: 5/5
Excellent logical organization and flow. The module progresses naturally:
1. Introduction (English) → Вступ (Ukrainian) — dual-language approach
2. Presentation of why Dative matters
3. Complete pronoun table
4. Three clear patterns (likes, needs, states)
5. Cultural insight on hospitality
6. Mini-dialogues for context
7. Reading practice
8. Production guidance
9. Summary

Transitions between sections are smooth. Progressive difficulty from recognition to production is well-maintained.

### Relevance: 5/5
Content perfectly matches the module title "The Dative I — Pronouns":
- All seven personal pronouns in Dative are covered
- Examples consistently use подобатися, потрібно, and state adverbs
- Grammar focus is exactly right for A2.1 (sixth case introduction)
- Vocabulary is topic-appropriate (state adverbs, Dative verbs)

### Educational Value: 5/5
**Strengths:**
- Clear pattern tables with literal translations (e.g., "To-me pleases coffee")
- Excellent inductive approach — shows patterns before explaining rules
- Strong cultural integration (hospitality, Witcher reference, folklore)
- Multiple authentic dialogues for context
- Good progression from recognition to production

### Language Quality: 5/5
**Strengths:**
- Clear, professional English explanations
- Grammatically correct Ukrainian throughout
- Consistent terminology
- Good balance of English and Ukrainian

### Word Salad: ❌ No
No signs of:
- Repeated sentence patterns
- Generic filler
- Contradictory explanations
- Auto-generation artifacts

## Strengths

1. **Excellent cultural integration** — The hospitality section brilliantly connects grammar to culture, explaining why "Вам чаю?" puts the guest in Dative as "the honored recipient."

2. **Strong cross-linguistic awareness** — Comparing Ukrainian "мені подобається" to Spanish "me gusta" and German "mir gefällt" helps learners with prior language experience.

3. **Authentic dialogues** — The three mini-dialogues at the café, with a friend, and discussing preferences feel natural and demonstrate real usage.

4. **Clear pattern presentation** — The three-column tables (Ukrainian | Literal | English) brilliantly show the structural difference from English.

---

## Issues

None remaining. Previous concern about content overlap with Module 02 was reviewed and found to be unfounded — the modules cover distinct topics (hospitality vs. давати/дарувати).

---

## Recommendation

**✅ PASS** — Excellent module with strong pedagogical design. No fixes required.

## Action Items

None.
