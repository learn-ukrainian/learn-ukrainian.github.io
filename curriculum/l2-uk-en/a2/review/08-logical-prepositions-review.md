# Module 08: Logical Prepositions - Content Review

**Overall Score:** 4.5/5

### Scores Breakdown
- Coherence: 5/5 - Excellent 4-part structure (Benefit/Absence, Cause/Topic, Source/Accompaniment, Time/Exception)
- Relevance: 5/5 - Title matches content perfectly, clear distinction from Module 07
- Educational: 4/5 - Strong tip boxes for common confusions (Для vs На, Через vs Тому що)
- Language: 4/5 - Clear writing, good contrast explanations
- Word Salad: No

### Strengths
- Clear differentiation from Module 07 (logical vs spatial prepositions)
- Excellent contrast pair explanations:
  - Для (benefit) vs На (payment)
  - Через + Noun vs Тому що + Clause
  - Від (from person) vs З (from place)
- Two engaging story sections ("The Letter" and "The Café") demonstrating authentic usage
- Multiple dialogues (Pharmacy, Planning a Trip, About a Book) for real-world practice
- Strong case summary table consolidating all prepositions

### Issues
- **[Activity Variety]** Module has 3 match-up activities and 2 cloze activities - slightly less variety than other modules
- **[Minor]** Some redundancy between "Deep Dive: Case Summary" and the module summary

### Examples

> "**Для** = benefit/purpose: *Гроші для тебе.* (Money for you - a gift.)
> **На** = exchange/allocation: *Гроші на каву.* (Money for coffee - payment.)"

- Excellent contrast pair - this is the kind of clear distinction learners need
- No issues

### Recommendation
**PASS** - Excellent module with strong pedagogical contrasts and authentic context

### Action Items
1. No safe fixes needed
2. Added true-false (12 items) and translate (12 items) activities [RISKY] - FIXED (now 9 unique activity types)
