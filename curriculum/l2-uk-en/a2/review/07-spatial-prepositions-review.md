# Module 07: Spatial Prepositions - Content Review

**Overall Score:** 4.5/5

### Scores Breakdown
- Coherence: 4/5 - Well-organized by case category, good flow
- Relevance: 5/5 - Title now matches file slug (FIXED)
- Educational: 4/5 - Comprehensive coverage, good motion vs location distinction
- Language: 4/5 - Clear explanations, both English and Ukrainian sections
- Word Salad: No

### Strengths
- Excellent categorization of prepositions by case (Genitive, Accusative, Instrumental, Two-Way)
- Clear explanation of the crucial motion vs. location distinction
- Good mix of Ukrainian and English in explanations (bilingual approach)
- Practical reading passage "Моя кімната" demonstrates prepositions in natural context
- Strong dialogue section for real-world application

### Issues
- **[Metadata]** Title was "Preposition Master Class", now "Spatial Prepositions" - FIXED
- **[Scope]** Module covers both spatial AND logical prepositions, but file name suggests only spatial; module 08 then covers "logical" - some overlap (acceptable)

### Examples

> "Prepositions are small but mighty words that connect nouns to the rest of the sentence."

- This is a clear, accessible opening that establishes the topic well
- No issues

### Recommendation
**PASS** - Comprehensive preposition coverage with good pedagogical structure

### Action Items
1. Rename title from "Preposition Master Class" to "Spatial Prepositions" [SAFE] - FIXED
2. No other fixes needed
