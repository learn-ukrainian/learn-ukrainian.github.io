## Strengths

1. **Systematic gender coverage** — The masculine → feminine → neuter → plural organization is logical and thorough. Each section has its own clear table.

2. **Practical register guidance** — The tip box on formal (-ові/-еві) vs. colloquial (-у/-ю) endings gives learners practical advice for different contexts.

3. **Consonant change warning** — The [!warning] box on г→з, к→ц, х→с changes is pedagogically crucial and well-explained with the phonological reason.

4. **Cultural depth** — The давати vs. дарувати distinction (neutral giving vs. meaningful gift) teaches vocabulary through cultural context.

5. **Excellent reading practice** — "Лист із Канади" demonstrates Dative nouns naturally, with comprehension questions that reinforce case recognition.
