## Summary

Outstanding module on the reflexive possessive pronoun свій. Clearly explains when to use свій (possessor = subject) vs його/її/їхній (possessor ≠ subject). Critical distinction that doesn't exist in English.

## Strengths

1. **Clear rule** - Subject owns it → свій; someone else owns it → його/її
2. **Ambiguity example** - Shows how English "He loves his mother" is ambiguous
3. **Full declension** - Complete свій paradigm across all cases/genders
4. **Edge cases** - Covers infinitive constructions and impersonal sentences

## Issues Found

None - exemplary treatment of a difficult topic.

## Recommendations

None required.
