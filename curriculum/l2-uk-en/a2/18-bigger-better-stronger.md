## Warm-up

Time to make comparisons! In this module, you'll learn to say things like "bigger," "better," "more interesting," and "faster" in Ukrainian. Comparing things is essential for everyday conversation — choosing products, describing people, expressing preferences, and giving opinions.

**Why comparatives matter:**
Every time you shop, you compare prices and quality. Every time you describe someone, you might compare their height, age, or other characteristics. And when expressing opinions about ideas, places, or experiences, comparatives help you articulate your preferences clearly. Mastering comparatives will make your Ukrainian significantly more expressive and practical.

**What you'll learn in this module:**
- How to form comparative adjectives (adding -ший/-іший to stems)
- Irregular comparatives — the most common ones don't follow the regular pattern
- Two different ways to make comparisons using "ніж" (than) and "за" (than + accusative)
- Expressions of preference and intensity (набагато — much, трохи — a little)

**Important Note About English vs Ukrainian:**
Unlike English, which uses "more + adjective" for longer adjectives (more interesting, more comfortable), Ukrainian almost always uses the single-word comparative form (цікавіший, комфортніший). The "більш + adjective" construction exists but is less common in everyday speech.

## Presentation

## Forming Comparative Adjectives

Ukrainian has two ways to form comparatives:

### 1. Synthetic Form (Single Word)

Add **-ший/-іший** to the adjective stem:

| Positive | Comparative | English |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| новий | нов**іший** | newer |
| старий | стар**іший** | older |
| добрий | добр**іший** | kinder |
| красивий | красив**іший** | more beautiful |
| цікавий | цікав**іший** | more interesting |

> 💡 **When to use -ший vs. -іший**
>
> After hard consonants, use **-ший** (but often -іший is possible too). After soft consonants, use **-іший**. In practice, **-іший** is very common and safe to use for most adjectives.

### 2. Compound Form (більш/менш + adjective)

For some adjectives or for emphasis, use **більш** (more) or **менш** (less) + positive adjective:

- більш важливий — more important
- менш цікавий — less interesting
- більш комфортний — more comfortable

**Use compound form when:**
- The adjective is long or complex
- You want to emphasize "MORE" or "LESS"
- No simple synthetic form exists

> 📜 **Style Note**
>
> Synthetic forms are more natural in everyday speech. Compound forms sound slightly more formal or emphatic.

## Irregular Comparatives

Some very common adjectives have completely irregular comparatives:

| Positive | Comparative | English |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| добрий — good | **кращий** | better |
| поганий — bad | **гірший** | worse |
| великий — big | **більший** | bigger |
| малий — small | **менший** | smaller |
| високий — tall | **вищий** | taller/higher |
| низький — short | **нижчий** | shorter/lower |
| довгий — long | **довший** | longer |
| короткий — short | **коротший** | shorter |
| широкий — wide | **ширший** | wider |
| вузький — narrow | **вужчий** | narrower |
| дорогий — expensive | **дорожчий** | more expensive |
| дешевий — cheap | **дешевший** | cheaper |

**MEMORIZE these!** They're very common in daily speech.

> [!tip] Memory Trick
> The most irregular ones are the most common adjectives. добрий → кращий and поганий → гірший are used constantly!

## Making Comparisons

There are TWO ways to compare in Ukrainian:

### 1. X + comparative + ніж + Y (than)

- Він **старший ніж** я. (He is older than I am.)
- Ця книга **цікавіша ніж** та. (This book is more interesting than that one.)
- Лев **більший ніж** кіт. (A lion is bigger than a cat.)

### 2. X + comparative + за + Accusative

- Він **старший за мене**. (He is older than me.)
- Ця книга **цікавіша за ту**. (This book is more interesting than that one.)
- Лев **більший за кота**. (A lion is bigger than a cat.)

**The difference:**
- **Ніж + Nominative** (more formal, clearer)
- **За + Accusative** (more colloquial, shorter)

> 🔍 **Important Grammar**
>
> With "ніж," the compared item stays in Nominative.
> With "за," the compared item changes to Accusative.

## Cultural Insight

## Comparatives in Daily Life

Ukrainians use comparatives constantly for shopping, planning, and expressing opinions:

**Shopping:**
- Цей телефон **кращий**, але **дорожчий**. (This phone is better but more expensive.)
- Є щось **дешевше**? (Is there something cheaper?)

**Preferences:**
- Мені подобається каву **більше**, ніж чай. (I like coffee more than tea.)
- Літо **тепліше** за зиму. (Summer is warmer than winter.)

**Opinions:**
- Він **розумніший** за мене. (He's smarter than me.)
- Ця ідея **краща**! (This idea is better!)

> [!tip] Intensifying Comparatives
> Use **набагато** (much), **трохи** (a little), **значно** (significantly):
> - Він набагато кращий. (He's much better.)
> - Вона трохи старша. (She's a little older.)

## Compliments and Softening

Ukrainians often use comparatives to pay compliments or to soften a statement.

**Compliments:**
- Ти виглядаєш **молодшою**! (You look younger! - *using Instrumental case context*)
- Ця сукня робить тебе **стрункішою**. (This dress makes you slimmer.)
- Сьогодні погода **краща**, ніж учора. (The weather today is better than yesterday.)

**Softening criticism:**
Instead of saying "This is bad" (Це погано), you might say:
- Це могло б бути **кращим**. (It could be better.)
- Я очікував чогось **більшого**. (I expected something bigger.)

Using these comparative structures makes your speech sound more nuanced and polite, rather than just stating blunt facts.

## Practice

## Practice Examples

Form the comparative:

1. **новий** → **новіший** (newer)
2. **старий** → **старіший** (older)
3. **добрий** → **кращий** (better) — irregular!
4. **великий** → **більший** (bigger) — irregular!
5. **цікавий** → **цікавіший** (more interesting)

Make comparisons:

6. Лев | кіт | великий → Лев **більший за кота**. OR Лев **більший ніж кіт**.
7. Зима | літо | холодний → Зима **холодніша за літо**.

**Additional Practice with Intensifiers:**

When you want to emphasize how much more something is, use intensifiers before the comparative:

8. **набагато кращий** — much better (e.g., Цей ресторан набагато кращий.)
9. **трохи дорожчий** — a little more expensive (e.g., Час від часу, якість коштує трохи дорожче.)
10. **значно швидший** — significantly faster (e.g., Новий комп'ютер значно швидший.)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Don't use both ніж and за in the same comparison — choose one.
- Remember that irregular comparatives don't add -іший: добрий → кращий (not *добріший).
- After за, always use Accusative case: вищий за **мене** (not *за я).

# Summary

## What You Learned

This module covered comparative adjectives in Ukrainian — a fundamental grammatical structure that you'll use constantly in everyday conversation for shopping, describing, and expressing preferences.

**Key Formation Patterns:**

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Synthetic | stem + -ший/-іший | старий → старіший — older |
| Compound | більш/менш + adj | більш важливий — more important |
| Irregular | memorize! | добрий → кращий — better |

**Formation:**
- Synthetic forms are simpler and more natural in spoken Ukrainian
- Compound forms using більш/менш are more formal or emphatic
- For adjective stem + ending: generally -іший is safe for most adjectives

**Irregular comparatives to memorize:**
These are among the most common adjectives in Ukrainian — you'll use them every day:
- добрий → кращий, поганий → гірший — quality
- великий → більший, малий → менший — size
- високий → вищий, низький → нижчий — height
- дорогий → дорожчий, дешевий → дешевший — price

**Comparison structures:**
There are two ways to say "than" in Ukrainian:
- X + comparative + **ніж** + Y — The compared item stays in Nominative case. More formal.
- X + comparative + **за** + Y — The compared item changes to Accusative case. More colloquial.

**Intensifying your comparisons:**
- набагато + comparative = much ___ (набагато кращий = much better)
- трохи + comparative = a little ___ (трохи старіший = a little older)
- значно + comparative = significantly ___ (значно дорожчий = significantly more expensive)

> 💡 **Пам'ятайте!**
>
> Найчастіше вживані прикметники мають неправильні форми! Їх просто потрібно запам'ятати: кращий, гірший, більший, менший, вищий, нижчий.
