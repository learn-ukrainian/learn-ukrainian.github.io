# Summary

This module consolidates your knowledge of **prepositions** — words like "in," "on," "to," "from," "with." Each preposition requires a specific **case**, and some change meaning based on which case follows. Master this, and you'll navigate Ukrainian fluently.

This grammatical concept is essential for everyday Ukrainian communication. Mastering it will significantly expand your ability to express complex ideas naturally. The patterns you learn here build on your previous knowledge while introducing new structures that native speakers use constantly.

By the end of this module, you'll understand not only the forms but also the reasoning behind them — why Ukrainian expresses these ideas in this particular way, and how this reflects the language's unique character and history.

---

# Warm-up

> 💡 **Prepositions are Case Triggers:** Every Ukrainian preposition demands a specific case. Some prepositions can take different cases with different meanings (motion vs. location). This module systematically reviews all major prepositions.



> 💡 **Connection to Real Life:** Think about how often you express these ideas in English. Now imagine expressing them naturally in Ukrainian, without translation. That's what we're building toward — direct Ukrainian thinking rather than constant mental translation.

## The Challenge

| Preposition | + Accusative | + Genitive | + Instrumental | + Locative |
|-------------|--------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| в/у | into | — | — | in |
| на | onto | — | — | on |
| з/із | — | from | with | — |
| під | under (motion) | — | under (location) | — |
| за | behind (motion) | — | behind (location) | — |

# Presentation: Preposition + Case Mastery



> [!important]
> **Why This Matters:** This grammatical structure appears in virtually every Ukrainian conversation. News, social media, literature, everyday speech — you'll encounter these forms constantly. The investment you make in mastering them pays dividends across all your Ukrainian language goals.

The patterns we're learning represent the living grammar of over 40 million Ukrainian speakers. When you internalize these forms, you're not just learning rules — you're acquiring the cognitive tools that native speakers develop naturally in childhood. This is the foundation of true fluency.


## 🎯 The Core Concept

Prepositions in Ukrainian are **case-bound**. Memorizing "в = in" is not enough — you must know "в + Accusative = into" vs. "в + Locative = in."

Understanding this grammatical structure is crucial for effective Ukrainian communication. Native speakers use these patterns instinctively, and mastering them will transform your ability to express complex ideas naturally. The forms you learn here represent centuries of linguistic evolution — they're not arbitrary rules but logical patterns that encode meaning in elegant, economical ways.

When you learn these structures, you're not just memorizing endings — you're internalizing the deep logic of how Ukrainian speakers think about actions, relationships, and experiences. This is what separates fluent speakers from perpetual beginners.



## Category 1: в/у (in/into)

| Case | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **+ Accusative** | INTO (motion) | Я йду **в школу**. (I go to school.) |
| **+ Locative** | IN (location) | Я **в школі**. (I am in school.) |

> ⚡ **в vs. у:** Use **у** before words starting with vowels or in awkward consonant clusters: "у Одесі," "у школу" (after a word ending in consonant).

## Category 2: на (on/onto)

| Case | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **+ Accusative** | ONTO (motion) | Я кладу книгу **на стіл**. |
| **+ Locative** | ON (location) | Книга лежить **на столі**. |

**Special uses with на + Acc/Loc:**
- на концерт / на концерті (to/at a concert)
- на роботу / на роботі (to/at work)
- на Україну / в Україні (controversial: "на" was imperial usage; "в" is correct modern Ukrainian)

## Category 3: з/із/зі (from/with)

| Case | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **+ Genitive** | FROM | Я йду **з роботи**. (I'm coming from work.) |
| **+ Instrumental** | WITH | Я йду **з другом**. (I'm going with a friend.) |

## Category 4: до (to/until)

| Case | Example |
|------|---------|
| **+ Genitive** | Я йду **до школи**. (I walk to school.) |
| **+ Genitive** | Працюю **до п'ятої**. (I work until five.) |

## Category 5: від

| Case | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **+ Genitive** | FROM (source) | Лист **від мами**. (Letter from mom.) |

## Category 6: для

| Case | Example |
|------|---------|
| **+ Genitive** | Подарунок **для тебе**. (Gift for you.) |

## Category 7: без

| Case | Example |
|------|---------|
| **+ Genitive** | Кава **без цукру**. (Coffee without sugar.) |

## Category 8: під

| Case | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **+ Accusative** | UNDER (motion) | Я кладу **під стіл**. |
| **+ Instrumental** | UNDER (location) | Лежить **під столом**. |

## Category 9: над

| Case | Example |
|------|---------|
| **+ Instrumental** | Лампа **над столом**. (Lamp above the table.) |

## Category 10: перед

| Case | Example |
|------|---------|
| **+ Instrumental** | Стою **перед дверима**. (I stand in front of the door.) |

## Category 11: за (behind/for)

| Case | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **+ Accusative** | BEHIND (motion) | Йду **за будинок**. |
| **+ Instrumental** | BEHIND (location) | Стою **за будинком**. |
| **+ Accusative** | FOR (purpose) | Дякую **за допомогу**. |

## Category 12: між

| Case | Example |
|------|---------|
| **+ Instrumental** | **Між нами**. (Between us.) |

## Category 13: через (through/because)

| Case | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **+ Accusative** | THROUGH | Йду **через парк**. |
| **+ Accusative** | BECAUSE OF | **Через дощ** я вдома. |

## Category 14: про

| Case | Example |
|------|---------|
| **+ Accusative** | Говоримо **про тебе**. (We talk about you.) |

## Reading Practice: City Navigation 📚

**Українською:**

Тарас у центрі Києва. Він йде з роботи додому. Спочатку він виходить з офісу і йде до станції метро. Метро — під землею. Він їде в метро до Хрещатика. Там він виходить на вулицю і йде через парк. За парком — його будинок. Він заходить у під'їзд і піднімається на п'ятий поверх. Перед дверима він зупиняється і шукає ключі. Вони лежать під курткою в сумці. Нарешті він заходить у квартиру. Над столом висить лампа. На столі — вечеря для нього від мами. Він сідає за стіл і їсть. Між справами він думає про вихідні.

**English Translation:**

Taras is in downtown Kyiv. He's coming home from work. First, he exits the office and walks to the metro station. The metro is underground. He rides the metro to Khreshchatyk. There he exits onto the street and walks through the park. Behind the park is his building. He enters the entrance and goes up to the fifth floor. In front of the door, he stops and looks for keys. They're under the jacket in the bag. Finally, he enters the apartment. Above the table hangs a lamp. On the table is dinner for him from mom. He sits at the table and eats. Between tasks, he thinks about the weekend.

## Conversation: Giving Directions 🗣️

**На площі Ринок у Львові:**

**Турист:** Перепрошую! Як дійти до Собору Святого Юра?
**Місцевий:** Ідіть прямо по цій вулиці. Потім поверніть за кутом.
**Турист:** За яким кутом?
**Місцевий:** За аптекою. Пройдіть через парк.
**Турист:** А потім?
**Місцевий:** Після парку побачите собор перед вами.
**Турист:** Це далеко від площі?
**Місцевий:** Ні, близько. П'ятнадцять хвилин пішки.
**Турист:** Дякую за допомогу!
**Місцевий:** Нема за що. Гарної прогулянки!

**At Rynok Square in Lviv:**

**Tourist:** Excuse me! How do I get to St. George's Cathedral?
**Local:** Go straight along this street. Then turn around the corner.
**Tourist:** Which corner?
**Local:** Behind the pharmacy. Go through the park.
**Tourist:** And then?
**Local:** After the park, you'll see the cathedral in front of you.
**Tourist:** Is it far from the square?
**Local:** No, close. Fifteen minutes on foot.
**Tourist:** Thank you for the help!
**Local:** You're welcome. Have a nice walk!

## Cultural Insight: Prepositions and Politics 🇺🇦

> [!important]
> **Politically Significant Preposition:** The preposition with Ukraine matters. Imperial Russia enforced **"на Украине"** (on Ukraine) to suggest Ukraine was a territory, not a country. Modern Ukrainian uses **"в Україні"** (in Ukraine), affirming nationhood. This grammatical choice carries political weight — use **В УКРАЇНІ**.

> [!tip]
> **Myth vs. Fact:** MYTH: "На Україну" is traditional. FACT: Historical Ukrainian texts often used "в Україну/в Україні." The imperial "на" was imposed. Today, "в Україні" is the standard in all official Ukrainian. Using "на" is either outdated or politically loaded.



> [!note]
> **Practical Application:** As you practice these forms, try using them in mental commentary throughout your day. See a friend? Think "Я телефоную другові." Walking to work? Think "Я йду до роботи." This constant mental practice is how polyglots achieve rapid fluency — they never stop thinking in their target language.

The beauty of Ukrainian grammar lies in its precision. Every ending carries meaning. Every form tells you something about the relationship between words. This is what makes Ukrainian such a sophisticated and expressive language — and what makes learning it so rewarding.



Mastering Ukrainian grammar opens doors to authentic connection with millions of Ukrainian speakers worldwide.
