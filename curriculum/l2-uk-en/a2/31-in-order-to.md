# Summary

## Warm-up

Why are you learning Ukrainian? To talk to friends? To read poetry? To travel to Kyiv?
In this module, we will learn how to explain "why" we do things using purpose clauses. The key word is **щоб** (in order to / so that). Mastering this structure allows you to express your motivations, goals, and even your wishes for other people.

**In this lesson, we will cover:**
- **Same Subject:** щоб + Infinitive (I came to help).
- **Different Subjects:** щоб + Past Tense (I want you to come).
- **Purpose vocabulary:** Купувати, заробляти, вчитися.

> 💡 **The Goal-Oriented Language**
> In Ukrainian, **щоб** is the bridge between an action and its goal. It is one of the most powerful connectors for moving beyond simple sentences and building complex, logical narratives.

## Presentation

## 1. Same Subject: In order to...

When the person doing the action and the person for whom the purpose is intended are the same, we use **щоб** followed by the **infinitive** form of the verb.

- Я прийшов, **щоб допомогти**. (I came [in order] to help.)
- Ми вчимося, **щоб знати** мову. (We study to know the language.)
- Він працює, **щоб заробляти** гроші. (He works to earn money.)

## 2. Different Subjects: So that someone else...

This is a unique feature of Ukrainian. If the subjects are different (I want YOU to do something), we use **щоб** followed by the **past tense** form of the verb. Even though the meaning might be in the future or present, the grammar requires the past form.

- Я хочу, **щоб ти прийшов**. (I want you to come; Literal: I want so-that you came.)
- Вона попросила, **щоб ми мовчали**. (She asked that we be silent.)
- Батьки хочуть, **щоб діти були** щасливі. (Parents want children to be happy.)

> [!important] Match the Gender!
> Because we use the past tense form in different-subject clauses, the verb must agree in gender and number with the second subject.
> *Я хочу, щоб вона **сказала** правду.* (I want her to tell the truth.)

Often, the best way to understand **щоб** is to look at how it connects different parts of a sentence. In Ukrainian, we don't just say "I want you to help," which uses a direct object and an infinitive. Instead, we create a secondary clause: "I want, so-that you helped." This structure highlights the importance of the second person's agency and makes the request sound more polite and indirect.

In daily life, you will hear **щоб** everywhere. At the supermarket (**магазин**), people buy food to cook dinner. At the university (**університет**), students study to pass exams. In the office, managers set goals so that the team achieves success. Each of these situations requires the correct form of **щоб** to be grammatically precise.

## 3. Purpose vs. Result

Be careful not to confuse **щоб** (purpose) with **тому що** (reason) or **так що** (so/result).
- Я пішов у магазин, **тому що** був голодний. (Reason)
- Я пішов у магазин, **щоб** купити хліб. (Purpose)
