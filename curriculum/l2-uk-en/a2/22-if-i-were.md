# Summary

## Warm-up

What would you do if you won the lottery? How would life be different if you spoke Ukrainian fluently? This module teaches you to express hypothetical situations — things that could happen, might happen, or aren't real.

**What you'll learn:**
- Real conditions with якщо — if
- Unreal conditions with якби (if... would)
- The conditional particle б/би
- Common hypothetical expressions

---

## Presentation

## Real vs. Unreal Conditions

Ukrainian distinguishes between conditions that are possible (real) and conditions that are imaginary (unreal):

### Real Conditions: якщо + future

For things that might actually happen:

- **Якщо** матиму час, прочитаю книгу.
  (If I have time, I will read the book.)
- Якщо буде сонячно, підемо на прогулянку.
  (If it's sunny, we'll go for a walk.)

**Formation:** якщо + future tense + future tense result.
This structure is used for situations that are realistically possible or planned. For example, talking about the weather or your schedule for tomorrow.

### Unreal Conditions: якби + past + б/би

For things that are not (or probably won't be) real:

- **Якби** я мав час, я **б** прочитав книгу.
  (If I had time, I would read the book.)
- Якби я був багатим, я б купив будинок.
  (If I were rich, I would buy a house.)

**Formation:** якби + past tense + б/би + past tense result.
This structure describes imaginary or counterfactual scenarios. Use it when dreaming about the impossible or discussing "what if" situations that aren't true right now.

> 💡 **Key Difference**
>
> **Якщо** = maybe true, could happen (real condition)
> **Якби** = not true, hypothetical (unreal condition)

## The Conditional Particle б/би

The particle **б/би** is essential for unreal conditions. It attaches to the verb or comes after the subject:

| Position | Example | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| After verb | Я читав би | I would read |
| After pronoun | Я б читав | I would read |
| After noun | Мама б сказала | Mom would say |

**Both positions are correct!** "Я б читав" and "Я читав би" mean the same thing.

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | Example | English |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Якби я був... | Якби я був богатим... | If I were rich... |
| Якби я знав... | Якби я знав... | If I knew... |
| Я б хотів... | Я б хотів побачити... | I would like to see... |
| Вона б сказала... | Вона б сказала правду. | She would tell the truth. |

> 📜 **Grammar Note**
>
> The conditional uses **past tense forms** for both the condition and the result, but the meaning is present or future hypothetical!

## Common Conditional Expressions

### Wishes and Desires

- Я б хотів/хотіла... (I would like...)
- Мені б хотілося... (I would want... — softer)
- Було б добре... (It would be good...)
- Це було б чудово! (That would be wonderful!)

### Polite Requests

Using conditional makes requests more polite:
- Чи могли б ви допомогти? (Could you help?)
- Ви не могли б сказати...? (Could you tell...?)

### Hypothetical Situations

- Якби я був на твоєму місці... (If I were in your place...)
- Якби я міг вибирати... (If I could choose...)

> [!tip] Politeness Tip
> Using "б" makes any request softer and more polite. "Чи могли б ви...?" is more polite than "Чи можете ви...?"

> 💡 **Grammar: The Particle "би"**
>
> The particle **би** (or **б** after vowels) is the magic word that turns reality into fantasy. It signals "would".
> - After consonant: **би** (Він мав **би**)
> - After vowel: **б** (Я мала **б**)
>
> **Placement:** It usually comes right after the verb, but can move for emphasis. The choice between "б" and "би" is entirely based on the preceding sound. If the previous word ends in a vowel, use "б" (e.g., Вона б). If it ends in a consonant, use "би" (e.g., Він би). This makes the language flow more smoothly when spoken.
> - Я **хотів би** це зробити. (Neutral)
> - Я **б хотів** це зробити. (Emphasis on "would")

## Polite Requests

Using the conditional mood is the standard for politeness in Ukrainian, just like "Could you?" in English.

Structure: **Чи могли б ви + infinitive?**
Literally: "Whether could would you...?"
This is perhaps the most useful phrase for a traveler in Ukraine. It transforms a direct command into a soft, respectful inquiry. Using the past tense form "могли" combined with the particle "б" creates a polite hypothetical space, exactly like the English "Could you possibly..."

- Чи могли б ви показати дорогу? (Could you show the way?)
- Чи могли б ви зачекати хвилину? (Could you wait a minute?)
- Чи могли б ви повторити? (Could you repeat?)
- Чи могли б ви дати мені води? (Could you give me some water?)
- Чи могли б ви зателефонувати пізніше? (Could you call later?)
- Чи хотіли б ви кави? (Would you like coffee?)

## Real vs. Unreal Conditions

**Real Condition (Якщо + Future):**
- Якщо я матиму час, я допоможу.
- (If I have time [reality], I will help.)

**Unreal Condition (Якби + Past + би):**
- Якби я мав час, я **б** допоміг.
- (If I had time [unreal], I **would** help.)

> [!observe]
> Notice the difference:
> "Якщо" (If) → Plan
> "Якби" (If only) → Dream

## Cultural Insight

## Superstitions about the Future

Ukrainians can be superstitious about stating plans too definitely, fearing to "jinx" them (**наврочити**).
- Instead of saying "I will definitely do X", they might add "**Дасть Бог**" (God willing) or "**Подивимось**" (We'll see).
- Using the conditional ("Якби...") is a safe space because it's hypothetical!

**Proverb:**
"Якби знав, де впаду, то соломки б підстелив."
(If I knew where I'd fall, I would have spread some straw.)
Meaning: You can't foresee everything, so hindsight is 20/20.

## Dialogue: Winning the Lottery!

**Олег:** Уяви, **якби** ти виграла мільйон доларів. Що **б** ти зробила?
**Марія:** Ого! Це цікаве питання. Думаю, я **б купила** великий будинок біля моря.
**Олег:** Тільки будинок?
**Марія:** Ні, ще я **б подорожувала** цілий рік. Я **б відвідала** Японію та Австралію. А ти?
**Олег:** А я **б відкрив** свій ресторан української кухні в Нью-Йорку.
**Марія:** Це чудова мрія! Але **якщо** ми не купимо лотерейний білет, ми нічого не виграємо.
**Олег:** Ти права. Це **реальність**.

> 🧠 **Language Myth: "Future in the Past"**
>
> Unlike English "I said I *would* go", Ukrainian uses Future tense in reported speech: "Я сказав, що *піду*" (I said that I *will* go). You generally DON'T use the conditional **би** for reported future, only for hypotheticals. This is a common point of confusion for English speakers, as "would" in English serves both purposes, but in Ukrainian, the conditional mood is strictly for imaginary or unreal scenarios.

## Practice

## Practice Examples

## Saying Sorry and Politeness

The conditional mood is also perfect for saying sorry and soft refusals.

- **Я б хотів вибачитися.** (I would like to apologize.)
- **Я б не хотів заважати.** (I would not want to disturb.)
- **Це було б незручно.** (That would be inconvenient.)

**Dialogue: Refusing an Invitation**
- **Іван:** Чи хотіли б ви піти в кіно?
- **Анна:** Я б дуже хотіла, але я зайнята. Якби я мала час, я б пішла.
- **Іван:** Розумію. Можливо, наступного разу?
- **Анна:** Так, це було б чудово.

> 🗣️ **Expression Focus: "На твоєму місці"**
>
> To give advice, use "**Якби я був на твоєму місці...**" (If I were in your place...).
> - **Якби я був на твоєму місці, я б купив це.** (If I were you, I'd buy it.)
> - **Якби я була на твоєму місці, я б не йшла туди.** (If I were you, I wouldn't go there.)
