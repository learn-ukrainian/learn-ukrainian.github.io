## Warm-up

**Тепер, коли ви розумієте аспект, давайте навчимося використовувати доконаний вид у минулому часі!**

Now that you understand the concept of aspect from Module 11, let's focus on using perfective verbs in the past tense. This is where aspect becomes most critical for communication — choosing perfective or imperfective past can completely change your meaning!

When you tell a story in Ukrainian, you constantly make choices: do you emphasize what happened (result) or what was happening (process)? These choices aren't random — they follow patterns that native speakers use automatically. By the end of this module, you'll begin to develop this intuition too.

**Why past tense is special for aspect:**
The past tense is where aspect differences are most visible and most important. In present tense, many contexts allow either aspect. But in past tense, the wrong choice can make your sentence confusing or even nonsensical to a native speaker.

**What you'll master in this module:**
- How to form perfective past tense (it's easier than you think!)
- When to choose perfective over imperfective in past contexts
- Key signal words that indicate completed actions
- Common perfective verbs in their past forms

**The Core Principle:** Perfective past = completed action with a clear result. If you can point to the result of the action, use perfective. If you're describing the process or duration, use imperfective.

> Доконаний вид у минулому часі = закінчена дія з чітким результатом. Якщо можна вказати на результат — використовуйте доконаний вид!

## Presentation

## Forming the Perfective Past

The good news: perfective verbs conjugate in past tense exactly like imperfective verbs! The past tense endings are the same for both aspects.

### Past Tense Endings (Same for Both Aspects)

| Gender/Number | Ending | Example (прочитати) |
|---------------|--------|---------------------|
| Masculine | -в | -∅ | прочитав |
| Feminine | -ла | прочитала |
| Neuter | -ло | прочитало |
| Plural | -ли | прочитали |

**Examples:**
- Він **прочитав** книгу. (He read/finished the book.)
- Вона **прочитала** статтю. (She read/finished the article.)
- Вони **прочитали** все. (They read/finished everything.)

> 💡 **Key Point**
>
> The difference isn't in the endings — it's in the verb itself. Прочитав and читав have the same endings, but different stems. Прочитав is perfective (completed), читав is imperfective (ongoing).

## Imperfective vs. Perfective Past: Side by Side

Let's compare the same verb pair in past tense:

| Aspect | Masculine | Feminine | Plural | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Impf. | писав | писала | писали | was writing |
| Perf. | написав | написала | написали | wrote/finished |
| Impf. | читав | читала | читали | was reading |
| Perf. | прочитав | прочитала | прочитали | read/finished |
| Impf. | робив | робила | робили | was doing |
| Perf. | зробив | зробила | зробили | did/finished |

## When to Use Perfective Past

### 1. Single Completed Action

When something happened once and is finished:
- Я **прочитав** книгу вчора. (I finished the book yesterday.)
- Вона **написала** листа. (She wrote/finished the letter.)
- Він **з'їв** сніданок. (He ate breakfast.)

### 2. Result Matters More Than Process

Focus on what got accomplished:
- Хто **написав** цю книгу? (Who wrote this book?)
- Вони **побудували** новий міст. (They built a new bridge.)

### 3. With "Already" (вже) and "Finally" (нарешті)

These words almost always signal perfective:
- Я **вже прочитав** цю книгу. (I've already read this book.)
- Вона **нарешті зробила** домашнє завдання. (She finally did her homework.)

> 📜 **Pattern Recognition**
>
> Words like вже, нарешті, раптом, несподівано often appear with perfective verbs because they emphasize completed events or results.

## When to Use Imperfective Past

### 1. Duration or Process

When the action lasted for some time:
- Я **читав** книгу три години. (I was reading for 3 hours.)
- Вона **писала** весь день. (She was writing all day.)

### 2. Repeated Actions

When something happened multiple times:
- Він **читав** цю книгу багато разів. (He read this book many times.)
- Ми **бачили** його часто. (We saw him often.)

### 3. Asking About Activities

When asking "what were you doing?":
- Що ти **робив** учора? (What were you doing yesterday?)
- Що вона **читала**? (What was she reading?)

> [!tip] Decision Guide
> Ask yourself: "Am I focusing on what got done (perfective) or what someone was doing (imperfective)?"

> 🌍 **Cultural Connection**
>
> Українська мова чітко розрізняє процес і результат. Це важлива частина слов'янського світогляду — ми цікавимось не лише ЩО сталось, але і ЯК це відбувалось!

## Practice

## Practice Examples

Choose perfective or imperfective for these contexts:

1. **I finished writing the letter.** → Я **написав** листа. (perf.)
2. **I was writing for 2 hours.** → Я **писав** дві години. (impf.)
3. **She said "yes."** → Вона **сказала** "так." (perf.)
4. **He was speaking loudly.** → Він голосно **говорив**. (impf.)
5. **We already read this.** → Ми вже це **прочитали**. (perf.)
6. **They were reading all evening.** → Вони **читали** весь вечір. (impf.)

**Self-Test Questions:**
Before moving to the activities, make sure you can answer these questions:
- What is the masculine past tense ending? Answer: -в or zero (consonant)
- What feminine ending do all past tense verbs use? Answer: -ла
- Does "пішов" come from "іти" or "піти"? Answer: піти — the perfective form

**Question:** Ти зробив це? (Did you do it?)
**Positive:** Так, я зробив це. (Yes, I did it.)
**Negative:** Ні, я не зробив це. (No, I didn't do it.)
