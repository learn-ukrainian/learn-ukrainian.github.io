This is especially important in Ukrainian culture, where showing respect for others' views matters greatly. This module teaches you the essential phrases for sharing opinions and for agreeing or disagreeing without causing offense. You will learn how to soften your statements when you are not completely certain, and how to acknowledge other people's points of view even when you do not share them.

## Presentation

## Expressing Opinions

In Ukrainian, expressing an opinion involves a main clause with an opinion verb followed by a що-clause (that-clause). This structure is similar to English but requires careful attention to the conjunction "що" which connects the two parts.

### Core Opinion Structures

| Expression | Meaning | Formality |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| Я думаю, що... | I think that... | neutral |
| Я вважаю, що... | I believe/consider that... | formal |
| Я гадаю, що... | I think/suppose that... | casual |
| Мені здається, що... | It seems to me that... | soft/tentative |
| На мою думку, ... | In my opinion, ... | formal |
| На мій погляд, ... | From my point of view... | formal |
| З моєї точки зору, ... | From my perspective... | very formal |

**Examples in Context:**
- **Я думаю, що** це правда. (I think that this is true.)
- **Мені здається, що** він правий. (It seems to me that he's right.)
- **На мою думку,** це хороша ідея. (In my opinion, this is a good idea.)
- **Я вважаю, що** це несправедливо. (I believe that this is unfair.)

> 💡 **Soft vs. Strong Opinions**
>
> The expression "Мені здається, що..." sounds gentler and more tentative than "Я думаю, що..." — use it when you are not certain or when you want to appear more open to other viewpoints. This is especially useful in polite conversation where you want to avoid sounding too assertive.

### Certainty Markers

When expressing opinions, you often want to indicate how certain you are. Ukrainian has several adverbs that modify the strength of your statement.

| Marker | Meaning | Certainty Level | Example |
|--------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| безумовно | undoubtedly | very high | Це **безумовно** правда. |
| очевидно | obviously | high | **Очевидно**, він правий. |
| напевно | probably | medium-high | Він **напевно** прийде. |
| мабуть | probably | medium | **Мабуть**, це так. |
| можливо | possibly | medium-low | **Можливо**, я помиляюся. |
| здається | it seems | low | **Здається**, буде дощ. |

> 📜 **When to Qualify Your Statements**
>
> Adding certainty markers shows that you are open to other perspectives. Saying "Можливо, я думаю..." sounds much more open than simply "Я думаю..." without qualification. This is considered polite in Ukrainian conversation.

---

## Agreeing and Disagreeing

Knowing how to agree and disagree politely is crucial for respectful conversation. Ukrainian offers various expressions at different levels of formality and strength.

### Agreeing

| Expression | Meaning | Strength |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Я згоден/згодна. | I agree. (m/f) | strong |
| Це правда. | That's true. | neutral |
| Так, точно. | Yes, exactly. | strong |
| Я теж так думаю. | I think so too. | neutral |
| Ви маєте рацію. | You're right. | polite/formal |
| Абсолютно! | Absolutely! | very strong |

> [!tip] Agreement Phrases
> Note that "згоден" is the masculine form and "згодна" is the feminine form. Always use the form that matches your gender.

### Disagreeing

| Expression | Meaning | Politeness |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Я не згоден/не згодна. | I disagree. (m/f) | neutral |
| Це не так. | That's not so. | neutral |
| Я б не сказав/сказала. | I wouldn't say that. (m/f) | polite |
| Не зовсім. | Not exactly. | soft |
| Можливо, але... | Possibly, but... | very polite |
| Я не впевнений/впевнена. | I'm not sure. (m/f) | soft |

> [!important] Polite Disagreement
> Direct disagreement can sound harsh in Ukrainian. Using "Я б не сказав/сказала" or "Не зовсім" softens your disagreement and shows respect for the other person's opinion. Starting with "Можливо, але..." acknowledges their point before introducing your different view.

## Cultural Insight

## Discussing Opinions in Ukrainian Culture

Ukrainians value open discussion and often express opinions directly in casual settings. However, politeness and respect for others' views are paramount in formal or professional contexts.

**Common strategies for polite discussion:**

**Softening your opinions:**
- Мені здається... (It seems to me...)
- Можливо, я помиляюся, але... (Maybe I'm wrong, but...)

**Respecting others' views:**
- Ви маєте рацію, але... (You're right, but...)
- Я розумію вашу думку, проте... (I understand your view, however...)

**Common phrases for debates:**
- А що ви думаєте? (And what do you think?)
- Але подумайте про... (But think about...)
- З іншого боку... (On the other hand...)

> 🔍 **Cultural Note**
>
> A polite Ukrainian strategy when disagreeing is to first acknowledge the other person's point with "Ви маєте рацію" (You're right) before introducing your different view. This shows respect and keeps the conversation friendly.

## Розмова про фільм

Оксана і Тарас обговорюють новий фільм.

**Оксана:** Тарасе, ти бачив новий фільм?

**Тарас:** Так, бачив. Я думаю, що він дуже цікавий.

**Оксана:** Справді? Мені здається, що він занадто довгий.

**Тарас:** Можливо, ти маєш рацію. Але, на мою думку, історія захоплююча.

**Оксана:** Я не зовсім згодна. Я вважаю, що кінець був слабкий.

**Тарас:** Це цікава думка. Напевно, режисер хотів здивувати глядачів.

**Оксана:** Мабуть, так. Але я б не сказала, що йому це вдалося.

**Тарас:** Що ж, у кожного своя думка!

**Оксана:** Безумовно! Це і робить кіно цікавим.

> 🌍 **Discussing Films in Ukraine**
>
> Ukrainians love discussing films and often have passionate debates about cinema. It's common to hear phrases like "На мою думку, це шедевр!" or "Я не згоден, фільм надто комерційний." Film discussions are a great way to practice expressing opinions in real conversations!

## Різні думки про погоду

Марія і Петро дивляться у вікно.

**Марія:** Петре, як ти думаєш, сьогодні буде дощ?

**Петро:** Мені здається, що так. Небо дуже темне.

**Марія:** Я не впевнена. На мій погляд, хмари рухаються на схід.

**Петро:** Можливо. Але, я гадаю, краще взяти парасольку.

**Марія:** Ти маєш рацію. Краще бути готовим!

**Петро:** Безумовно! Я завжди так думаю про погоду в Україні.

**Марія:** Згодна з тобою. Погода тут непередбачувана.

> 🎯 **Practice Tip**
>
> When practicing these dialogues, try to use different certainty markers each time. Instead of always saying "Я думаю, що..." try "Мені здається, що..." or "На мою думку..." This variety makes your Ukrainian sound more natural and shows mastery of multiple expressions.

---
