        # Fix 1 issue(s) in `being-and-becoming`

        ### Fix: Gate `Immersion` FAIL — 12.8% LOW (target 45-65% (A2.1))
**⚠ SCOPE WARNING:** Immersion gap is 32% (12.8% → 45% min). This is too large for a fix pass. Focus on the EASIEST wins:
1. Add Ukrainian section headers with English in parentheses
2. Add 'Наприклад:' / 'Порівняйте:' before example blocks
3. Add short Ukrainian phrases with (translations) in existing paragraphs
Do NOT rewrite entire sections. Target +5-8% improvement max.

### Other Audit Failures

❌ AUDIT FAILED. Correct errors before proceeding.

```





## Immersion Rules

TARGET: 45-65% Ukrainian.

**Structural containment**: English prose in paragraphs. Ukrainian in CONTAINERS ONLY (tables, blockquotes, numbered lists, dialogues). Do NOT mix Ukrainian words into English sentences.


## Level Constraints

GRAMMAR RULES:
- Max 15 words per Ukrainian sentence
- Max 2 clauses per sentence
- All cases allowed
- Simple subordinate clauses allowed (який/що/коли)
- Aspect pairs introduced but not complex
- No participles


## Verification Tools (USE THEM)

You have MCP tools for Ukrainian language verification. **Use them before fixing.**

- `verify_words(["word1", "word2"])` — check words exist in VESUM (standard Ukrainian dictionary)
- `verify_lemma("word")` — get all inflected forms of a word

**Before replacing any Ukrainian word:**
1. Call `verify_words` with your replacement to confirm it exists
2. If NOT FOUND, call `verify_lemma` on the base form to find correct inflections
3. Never use a word that returns NOT FOUND — rephrase in English instead
