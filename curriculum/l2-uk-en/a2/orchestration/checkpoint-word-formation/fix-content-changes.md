## Applied Fixes

3. Section "Skill 4: Root Families": Standardized the instruction to "Визначте **цілі слова**" across all applicable items (6, 10, 12). — addresses the review's advice to select whole words rather than morphemes for pedagogical consistency.
4. Throughout: Verified that all complex sentences (especially in unjumble and skill 4) have proper punctuation (commas before «що», «який», «щоб»). — addresses Issue 6 and Fix Plan (Language).
5. Throughout: Verified that "словотвору слів" tautology is absent in the instruction/examples and explained in the "Linguistic Insight". — addresses Issue 6.
6. Throughout: Verified that Latin script typo `napisав` is absent and correctly spelled as `написав`. — addresses Issue 1.

## Fixes NOT Applied (explain why)

- Activity-specific fixes (cloaks duplication, mark-words logic in YAML, activity counts) were not applied to the markdown content as they pertain to the activities YAML files, though the content's practice sections already exceed the required counts and avoid the logic errors mentioned.
