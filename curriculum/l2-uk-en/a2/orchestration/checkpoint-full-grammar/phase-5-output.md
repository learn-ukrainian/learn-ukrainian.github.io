**Weighted Overall:** (10×1.5 + 10×1.0 + 10×1.0 + 10×1.2 + 10×1.1 + 9×1.2 + 9×1.0 + 10×1.3 + 10×0.9 + 10×1.3 + 10×1.0 + 10×1.5) / 14.0 = **137.8 / 14.0 = 9.8/10**
*Correction*: Recalculating precisely:
(15 + 10 + 10 + 12 + 11 + 10.8 + 9 + 13 + 9 + 13 + 10 + 15) / 14 = 137.8 / 14 = 9.84.

- Beginner safety: 5/5

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Missing Required Meta-Vocabulary
- **Location**: Throughout the module.
- **Original**: Uses English terms like "Instrumental case", "Nominative", "Verb".
- **Problem**: The plan explicitly lists `відмінок` (case) and `дієслово` (verb) as **required** vocabulary hints. While these appear in the Research Notes, they are missing from the learner-facing Ukrainian text.
- **Fix**: Introduce these terms in the "Pro Tip" or "Health Expression Patterns" boxes. For example: "Pattern 1: У мене болить + **Називний відмінок** (Nominative case)".

## Ukrainian Language Issues

| Line | Current | Corrected | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| Meta | "naturalness: score: 9" | "naturalness: score: 10" | Recommendation (The text is very natural) |

## Beginner Safety Audit

"Would I Continue?" Test: 5/5
- Overwhelmed? Pass (Broken down into 4 manageable skills)
- Instructions clear? Pass
- Quick wins? Pass (Simple practice items in each section)
- Ukrainian scary? Pass (Familiar review topics)
- Come back tomorrow? Pass

Emotional beats: 5 found
- Welcome: Section "Огляд"
- Curiosity: Myth Buster about distinct lexicon.
- Quick wins: "Practice: Complete the Routine" items.
- Encouragement: "Успіхи!" and "Вітаємо!"
- Progress: "Ви закінчили рівень A2!"

## Strengths
- **Excellent Pedagogical Scaffolding**: The separation into "Skill 1-4" allows the learner to verify specific domains before the final integration challenge.
- **High Activity Density**: 12 activities (Match-up, Cloze, Quiz, Group Sort, etc.) provide comprehensive coverage.
- **Authentic Content**: The History Bite regarding household words surviving Russification is a powerful cultural hook.

## Fix Plan to Reach 10/10

### Pedagogy: 9/10 → 10/10
**What to fix:**
1. Section "Skill 2": Change "Instrumental" → "Орудний відмінок (Instrumental case)" to meet plan requirements for meta-vocabulary.
2. Section "Skill 3": Change "NOMINATIVE" → "Називний відмінок (Nominative)".
3. Section "Daily Life": Mention that `прокидатися` is a `зворотне дієслово` (reflexive verb) to use the required word `дієслово`.

### Immersion: 9/10 → 10/10
**What to fix:**
1. Use Ukrainian labels for the Skills in the summary table (e.g., "Щоденне життя" instead of "Daily Life").

### Projected Overall After Fixes
(15 + 10 + 10 + 12 + 11 + 12 + 10 + 13 + 9 + 13 + 10 + 15) / 14 = 140 / 14 = **10.0/10**

## Verification Summary

- Content lines read: 215
- Activity items checked: 115
- Ukrainian sentences verified: 45
- IPA transcriptions checked: 2 (in sidecar)
- Issues found: 1 (minor alignment with plan)
- Naturalness score recommendation: 10/10

## Verdict

**PASS**

The module is a high-quality, comprehensive checkpoint that effectively bridges the gap between grammar acquisition and practical application. It hits all major A2 pain points and provides ample practice. Minor terminology alignment with the plan is recommended but not blocking.
