## Warm-up

Now that you can form comparatives and superlatives, let's use them to express preferences! This module teaches you how to say what you like better, make choices, and explain why you prefer one thing over another.

**What you'll learn:**
- How to say "I prefer X to Y"
- Comparing actions (better to do this than that)
- Making and explaining choices
- Useful expressions for everyday decisions

## Presentation

## Expressing Preferences

There are several ways to express what you like better in Ukrainian:

### 1. Мені більше подобається X (ніж Y)

"I like X more (than Y)" — the most common way:

- Мені **більше подобається** кава. (I like coffee more.)
- Мені більше подобається кава, **ніж** чай. (I like coffee more than tea.)
- Мені більше подобаються книги, ніж фільми. (I like books more than movies.)

> 💡 **Grammar Deep Dive: The Logic of "Like"**
>
> In English, "I like coffee" is a simple Subject-Verb-Object sentence. You (Subject) do the action of liking.
>
> In Ukrainian, "Мені подобається кава" is reversed: "To me (Dative) pleases coffee (Subject)."
> - **Coffee** is the active subject that causes the feeling.
> - **You** are the passive recipient (Experiencer) in the Dative case.
>
> This is why the verb **подобається** agrees with the thing being liked, not you!
> - Мені **подобається** цей *фільм*. (The movie pleases me.)
> - Мені **подобаються** ці *фільми*. (The movies please me.)

### 2. Я віддаю перевагу X (Dative)

"I give preference to X" — more formal:

- Я **віддаю перевагу** каві. (I prefer coffee.) — Dative!
- Я віддаю перевагу книгам. (I prefer books.) — Dative plural!

**Note:** The thing you prefer goes in **Dative case**!

### 3. Краще X ніж Y

"X is better than Y" — for comparing options:

- **Краще** кава, ніж чай. (Coffee is better than tea.)
- Краще читати, ніж дивитися телевізор. (It's better to read than to watch TV.)

### 4. Я б вибрав/вибрала X

"I would choose X" — for expressing choices:

- Я б **вибрав** зелений. (I would choose the green one.) — masculine speaker
- Я б **вибрала** каву. (I would choose coffee.) — feminine speaker

> �️ **Pronunciation Tip: "В" in "Вибрав"**
>
> The verb **вибрав** has two 'v' sounds. The first is a clear [v], the last one is a softer bilabial [w] (like in 'wow'), because it's at the end of a syllable followed by a consonant or end of word. Pronounce it like "vy-brau".

> �📜 **Formality Scale**
>
> Most casual: Мені більше подобається
> Neutral: Краще
> More formal: Я віддаю перевагу
> Hypothetical: Я б вибрав/вибрала

## Comparing Actions

You can compare actions using comparatives + infinitives:

### Pattern: Comparative adverb + infinitive

| Comparison | Example | English |
|------------|---------|---------|
| краще | Краще читати. | It's better to read. |
| гірше | Гірше нічого не робити. | It's worse to do nothing. |
| легше | Легше говорити. | It's easier to say. |
; важче | Важче робити. | It's harder to do. |
| цікавіше | Цікавіше подорожувати. | It's more interesting to travel. |

**Full comparison:**
- Краще **читати**, ніж **дивитися** телевізор.
- Легше **говорити**, ніж **робити**.
- Цікавіше **подорожувати**, ніж **сидіти** вдома.
- Це **корисніше** для здоров'я. (This is more useful for health.)
- Це **шкідливіше**. (This is more harmful.)
- Це **ефективніше**. (This is more effective.)
- Це **нудніше**. (This is more boring.)
- Я **волію** чай. (I prefer tea.)
- Тут **комфортніше**. (It is more comfortable here.)
- Цей чай **гарячіший**. (This tea is hotter.)
- Це **практичніше**. (This is more practical.)

> "Легше сказати, ніж зробити" (It's easier said than done) is a popular Ukrainian saying!

## Cultural Insight

## The Art of Hospitality & Refusal

Ukrainians are famous for their hospitality (**гостинність**). If you visit a Ukrainian home, you will likely be offered food and drink multiple times.

**The "Three Offers" Rule:**
It is polite for a host to offer something even if you refuse the first time. Often, you might hear "Proshu, proshu!" (Please, please!).
If you really want to refuse, simply saying "No" (Ні) can be too direct. Instead, express a preference or a reason:

- **Дякую, але я більше люблю чай.** (Thank you, but I like tea more.)
- **Я б вибрав воду, якщо можна.** (I would choose water, if possible.)
- **Мені це не дуже подобається.** (I don't like this very much - *use cautiously!*)
- **Я вже не голодний/не голодна.** (I am not hungry anymore.)

## Dialogue: Choosing a Restaurant
**Андрій:** Куди підемо вечорі? В італійський ресторан чи в суші-бар?
**Олена:** Чесно кажучи, я **віддаю перевагу** італійській кухні.
**Андрій:** Чому? Тобі не подобаються суші?
**Олена:** Подобаються, але сьогодні холодно. **Краще** з'їсти щось гаряче, наприклад, пасту чи піцу.
**Андрій:** Згоден. Гаряча їжа взимку — це **найкращий** вибір.
**Олена:** Тоді я б **вибрала** "Траторію" в центрі. Там **затишніше**.

> 🔍 **Why Preferences Matter**
>
> Expressing preferences politely is important in Ukrainian social settings. Using "б" (would) forms sounds more polite than direct statements.

## Asking for Advice

Sometimes making a choice is hard! In these cases, it is very common to ask for advice (**порада**).
Here is how you can ask someone to help you choose:

- **Що ти порадиш?** (What do you advise? - *Informal*)
- **Що ви порадите?** (What do you advise? - *Formal/Plural*)
- **Яку страву краще вибрати?** (Which dish is better to choose?)
- **На твою думку, що краще?** (In your opinion, what is better?)

**Example:**
- **А:** Я не знаю, що купити. Що ти порадиш?
- **Б:** На мою думку, краще купити цей телефон. Він новіший.

> [!note] Grammar: Радити
> The verb **радити | порадити** (to advise) takes the **Dative** case for the person being advised (Раджу **тобі**...), but usually, you just ask "Що порадиш?" implicating "to me".

> 🍲 **Cultural Context: Ordering in a Café**
>
> In Ukrainian cafés, the waiter might ask: "Що ви вибрали?" (What have you chosen?) or "Ви вже готові замовити?" (Are you ready to order?).
> A polite way to order is using "Я буду..." (I will have...) or "Мені, будь ласка..." (For me, please...).
> If you can't decide, ask the waiter: "**Що ви порадите?**" (What do you recommend?). They will appreciate your trust!

> 🎬 **Media Recommendation**
>
> To see people making difficult choices (often comedic ones), watch episodes of the TV show **"Kitchen" (Кухня)** or similar sitcoms popular in Ukraine. Pay attention to how characters argue about what is "better" or "worse" using comparatives: "Це краще, ніж..." (This is better than...).
