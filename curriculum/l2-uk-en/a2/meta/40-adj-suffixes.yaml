module: a2-40
level: A2
slug: 40-adj-suffixes
version: '2.0'
id: a2-40
naturalness:
  score: 8
  status: PASS
  issues:
  - Text is truncated at the very end of the dialogue ('glass wor')
  - Some instructional sentences are repetitive (frequent use of 'Це...' structure)
  - Instructional Ukrainian is B1+ level (complex for A2 reading alone), though natural
    for a textbook context
  recommendation: Complete the truncated sentence at the end. Try to vary the sentence
    structure in the explanations to reduce the repetition of 'Це [adjective/noun]'.
