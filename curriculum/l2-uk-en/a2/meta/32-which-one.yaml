module: 32-which-one
level: A2
slug: 32-which-one
version: '2.0'
id: a2-32
naturalness:
  score: 9
  status: PASS
  issues:
  - Dialogue lines are slightly forced to ensure grammar usage (e.g., 'місце, у якому'
    instead of 'де'), but this is pedagogically justified for the target grammar point.
  recommendation: No changes needed; the module effectively teaches the target concept
    with appropriate A2 complexity.
