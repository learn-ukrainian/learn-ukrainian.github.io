Emotional beats: 4 found
- Welcome: Intro connects grammar to "maturity".
- Curiosity: "The Architecture of Why".
- Encouragement: "Your Ukrainian is no longer just a collection of bricks."
- Progress: "You have unlocked the ability to sustain longer... conversations."

## Strengths
- **Nuance Handling**: The module brilliantly distinguishes between *завдяки* (positive) and *через* (negative/neutral), a common pitfall for learners.
- **Register Awareness**: Explicitly teaching that *бо* is conversational while *оскільки* is formal/logical is excellent pedagogy.
- **Activity Design**: The "Job Interview" cloze text is a cohesive narrative that reinforces the grammar in a realistic context.

## Verdict

**PASS**

This is a gold-standard A2 module. It takes a dry grammar topic (conjunctions) and makes it feel like a tool for social empowerment ("Maturity of Speech"). The activities are rigorous and correctly aligned with the content. No changes needed.
