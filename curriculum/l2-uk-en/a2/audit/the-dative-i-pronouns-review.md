| 2 | Coherence | 10/10 | <7 | Logical flow from pronouns to states/needs. |

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Missing Required Vocabulary
- **Location**: Content & Vocabulary
- **Original**: (Missing)
- **Problem**: The plan explicitly requires the words: `необхідно`, `важко`, `легко`, `приємно`. These are absent from the text and vocabulary list.
- **Fix**: Add examples using these words in the "Physical and Emotional States" and "Expressing Likes and Needs" sections.

### Issue 2: Vocabulary File Noise
- **Location**: `vocabulary/01-the-dative-i-pronouns.yaml`
- **Original**: Contains words like `аудіювання`, `взимку`, `робот`, `люда`, `марко` etc.
- **Problem**: The vocabulary file contains words not present in the module text, likely from a template or larger dump.
- **Fix**: Clean up the vocabulary file to match ONLY the words taught/used in the module.

## Fix Plan to Reach 9/10

### Educational: 6/10 → 9/10

**What to fix:**
1. **Section "Expressing Likes and Needs"**: Add `необхідно` as a formal synonym for `потрібно`.
   - Add sentence: "Також можна сказати: **Мені необхідно** (I usually/urgently need)."
2. **Section "Physical and Emotional States"**: Add `важко`, `легко`, `приємно`.
   - Add examples:
     - **Мені важко.** (It is hard for me.)
     - **Тобі легко?** (Is it easy for you?)
     - **Нам приємно.** (We are pleased / It is pleasant for us.)
3. **Vocabulary File**: Prune the YAML file to match the actual text content.

**Expected score after fix:** 9/10

### Relevance: 8/10 → 9/10

**What to fix:**
1. The addition of `важко` (hard) and `легко` (easy) in the fix above directly addresses this by adding high-utility descriptors for daily life.

**Expected score after fix:** 9/10

### Projected Overall After Fixes

(9*1.5 + 10*1 + 9*1 + 9*1.2 + 10*1.1 + 9*1.2 + 9*1 + 10*1.3 + 9*0.9 + 9*1.3 + 9*1 + 10*1.5) / 14 = **9.27/10**

## Verification Summary

- Content lines read: ~140
- Activity items checked: 62
- Ukrainian sentences verified: ~45
- IPA transcriptions checked: 0 (Not present in text body, present in vocab but vocab file is noisy)
- Issues found: 2
- Naturalness score recommendation: 10/10

## Verdict

**FAIL**

The module is linguistically excellent and pedagogically sound, but it fails to meet the strict Plan Verification criteria by missing 4 required vocabulary items (`необхідно`, `важко`, `легко`, `приємно`). Adding these high-frequency words will align the content with the plan and improve relevance. The vocabulary file also requires cleanup.
