# Давальний відмінок I — Займенники

## Introduction

Welcome to the sixth Ukrainian case: the **Dative** (давальний відмінок). You've already learned five cases — Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Locative, and Vocative. The Dative completes the core case system and unlocks essential everyday expressions.

In this module, you'll learn how to say "I like," "I need," and "I'm cold" in Ukrainian. These expressions all use the Dative case, which marks the **recipient** or **experiencer** of an action or state.

**What you'll learn:**
- All seven personal pronouns in the Dative case
- How to express likes with **подобатися** (to be pleasing)
- How to express needs with **потрібно** (to be needed)
- How to describe physical and emotional states

**Why the Dative matters:**
In English, we say "I like music" — the person who likes is the subject. In Ukrainian, the structure is reversed: "Мені подобається музика" literally means "To-me is-pleasing music." The music is the grammatical subject; the person is in the Dative case. This pattern appears throughout Ukrainian.

## Вступ

Ви вже знаєте п'ять українських відмінків: називний, знахідний, родовий, місцевий і кличний. Тепер час познайомитися з шостим — **давальним відмінком**.

Чи замислювалися ви, як сказати «I like music» українською? Або «She needs help»? Або «It's cold to him»? Усі ці вирази потребують особливої граматичної структури — і ця структура — давальний відмінок.

В англійській мові для позначення отримувача дії використовують прийменники «to» і «for». Українська мова натомість використовує відмінкові закінчення. Питальне слово для давального відмінка — **кому?** для людей і **чому?** для речей.

Почнемо з найлегшого: займенників. Коли ви опануєте займенники в давальному відмінку, уся система відмінків стане зрозумілішою.

## Presentation

### Why the Dative Case Matters

The Dative case answers a fundamental question in any language: **Who receives something?** When you give a gift, tell a story, or explain an idea — someone receives it. That "someone" goes into the Dative case.

But Ukrainian Dative is even more powerful. It expresses four key functions:

| Function | English | Ukrainian | Pattern |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Recipients** | I give a book to my friend. | Я даю книгу другові. | Verb + Acc + Dat |
| **Experiencers** | I'm cold. | Мені холодно. | Dat + adverb |
| **Needs** | You need to rest. | Тобі потрібно відпочити. | Dat + потрібно + inf |
| **Likes** | She likes music. | Їй подобається музика. | Dat + подобатися + Nom |

The question word for Dative is **кому?** (to whom?) for people and **чому?** (to what?) for things.

### Чому давальний відмінок важливий

Давальний відмінок відповідає на фундаментальне питання в будь-якій мові: **Хто щось отримує?** Коли ви даруєте подарунок, розповідаєте історію або пояснюєте ідею — хтось це отримує. Цей «хтось» стоїть у давальному відмінку.

Але український давальний відмінок ще потужніший. Він виражає:

- **Отримувачів:** Я даю книгу другові.
- **Переживачів:** Мені холодно.
- **Потреби:** Тобі потрібно відпочити.
- **Уподобання:** Їй подобається музика.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> In Ukrainian, you don't "have" feelings — feelings "happen to you." When you're cold, sad, or happy, you put yourself in the Dative case. Мені сумно (I'm sad) literally means "to me it's sad." This structure appears in many Slavic languages and reflects a worldview where emotions are forces that act upon us rather than states we control. Learning this grammar pattern will fundamentally change how you think about expressing feelings in Ukrainian.

### The Dative Pronouns

Here is the complete table of personal pronouns in the Dative case:

| Називний | Давальний | Приклад |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| я | **мені** | Дай мені книгу. |
| ти | **тобі** | Я скажу тобі правду. |
| він | **йому** | Йому подобається футбол. |
| вона | **їй** | Дайте їй воду. |
| воно | **йому** | — |
| ми | **нам** | Розкажи нам про себе. |
| ви | **вам** | Вам потрібна допомога? |
| вони | **їм** | Я допомагаю їм. |

Notice that **він** and **воно** share the same dative form: **йому**. This is because neuter nouns are rare as recipients in natural speech.

### Pattern 1: Expressing Likes

The verb **подобатися** (to please, to be liked) always uses the Dative case for the person who likes something:

| Ukrainian | Literal Translation | Natural English |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Мені подобається кава. | To-me pleases coffee. | I like coffee. |
| Тобі подобається Київ? | To-you pleases Kyiv? | Do you like Kyiv? |
| Йому подобається музика. | To-him pleases music. | He likes music. |
| Їй подобається танцювати. | To-her pleases to-dance. | She likes to dance. |
| Нам подобається ця книга. | To-us pleases this book. | We like this book. |
| Вам подобається Україна? | To-you pleases Ukraine? | Do you like Ukraine? |
| Їм подобається футбол. | To-them pleases football. | They like football. |

The thing that is liked stays in the **Nominative** case (музика, кава, книга). The person who likes goes into **Dative** (мені, тобі, йому).

> 🔗 **Language Link**
>
> The Ukrainian "мені подобається" structure is similar to Spanish "me gusta" or German "mir gefällt." The liked thing is the grammatical subject; the person is the indirect object (Dative). English "I like music" is actually unusual among European languages! If you've studied Spanish, German, or other European languages, you may find this pattern familiar. The key difference: in Ukrainian, case endings (not prepositions) mark the Dative relationship.

### Pattern 2: Expressing Needs

The word **потрібно** (needed, necessary) also uses the Dative case for the person who needs something:

| Ukrainian | English |
|-----------|---------|
| Мені потрібно працювати. | I need to work. |
| Тобі потрібно відпочити. | You need to rest. |
| Йому потрібна допомога. | He needs help. |
| Їй потрібно йти. | She needs to go. |
| Нам потрібно поговорити. | We need to talk. |
| Вам потрібна кава? | Do you need coffee? |
| Їм потрібно більше часу. | They need more time. |

Note: After потрібно, use the infinitive (працювати, відпочити) or a noun (допомога, кава).

### Pattern 3: Physical and Emotional States

Ukrainian expresses many feelings and physical states using Dative + adverb:

| Ukrainian | Literal | English |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Мені холодно. | To-me it's cold. | I'm cold. |
| Тобі тепло? | To-you it's warm? | Are you warm? |
| Йому погано. | To-him it's bad. | He feels bad. |
| Їй добре. | To-her it's good. | She feels fine. |
| Нам весело. | To-us it's fun. | We're having fun. |
| Вам сумно? | To-you it's sad? | Are you sad? |
| Їм цікаво. | To-them it's interesting. | They find it interesting. |

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: The Witcher**
>
> In the Ukrainian dub of "The Witcher" (Відьмак), Geralt often says "Мені байдуже" (I don't care | It's indifferent to me). This Dative construction shows emotional detachment — the feeling acts upon Geralt, but he remains passive. Very fitting for the stoic character! This phrase is extremely useful in casual conversation when you want to express indifference about something.

## Cultural Insight

### The Grammar of Ukrainian Hospitality

The Dative case reveals something beautiful about Ukrainian culture: it's the grammar of giving, receiving, and caring for others.

Ukrainians are famous for their hospitality — and hospitality is fundamentally about giving to others. That "to others" is expressed grammatically through the Dative case. When you visit a Ukrainian home, every offer of food, drink, or comfort puts you in the Dative position — the position of the honored recipient.

When you visit a Ukrainian home, you'll hear:

— Вам чаю? (Would you like tea? — literally: To-you tea?)
— Тобі ще? (More for you? — literally: To-you more?)
— Дайте йому тарілку. (Give him a plate.)

The host puts the guest in the Dative — the position of receiver. Refusing food or drink is almost impossible in Ukrainian culture. "Мені не треба" (I don't need it) will be met with "Та ні, тобі треба!" (Oh yes, you do need it!).

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> In Ukrainian restaurants, you'll often hear waiters ask: "Вам меню?" (Menu for you?), "Вам рахунок?" (Check for you?). These short phrases put you in the Dative — the recipient of service. Now you know why!

### Mini-Dialogues

The following three mini-dialogues show Dative pronouns in natural conversation. Notice how every offer ("Would you like X?") and every expression of feeling ("I'm cold") uses the Dative case. These patterns are extremely common in daily Ukrainian.

**Dialogue 1: At the Café in Lviv**

This dialogue shows how waiters use Dative to make offers. Notice: Вам (to you), мені (to me), йому (to him).

— Вам каву чи чай?
— Мені каву, будь ласка.
— Йому теж?
— Ні, йому чай. Йому не подобається кава.

*(— Coffee or tea for you? — Coffee for me, please. — For him too? — No, tea for him. He doesn't like coffee.)*

**Dialogue 2: Checking on a Friend**

This dialogue demonstrates physical states (cold, warm) and needs. All use Dative + adverb or Dative + потрібно patterns.

— Тобі добре?
— Ні, мені погано. Мені холодно.
— Тобі потрібна куртка?
— Так, дякую. Тепер мені тепло.

*(— Are you okay? — No, I feel bad. I'm cold. — Do you need a jacket? — Yes, thanks. Now I'm warm.)*

**Dialogue 3: Discussing Preferences**

This conversation uses подобається extensively to discuss what people like. Notice how the dialogue switches between singular informal (тобі), plural/formal (вам), and third-person plural (їм).

— Вам подобається Київ?
— Так, нам дуже подобається! Нам тут цікаво.
— А їм подобається?
— Їм теж подобається. Їм подобається метро.

*(— Do you like Kyiv? — Yes, we like it very much! We find it interesting here. — And do they like it? — They like it too. They like the metro.)*

## Reading Practice: Листівка з Одеси

Below is a postcard from Odesa that uses many Dative constructions you've learned. Before reading, remember:
- Look for pronouns like **мені, тобі, нам, вам, їм** — these are Dative markers
- The verb **подобається/подобалася** signals a "like" construction
- Expressions like **тобі потрібно** mean "you need to"

Read the postcard once for general meaning, then read again to identify each Dative construction. Can you find at least 8 Dative pronouns?

**Vocabulary preview:**
- листівка — postcard
- сподобалося — (it) was liked (past tense of подобатися)
- замовлення — order (in a restaurant)
- до зустрічі — see you (goodbye)

Привіт!

Мені дуже подобається Одеса. Тут тепло і весело. Морю тут гарно — йому подобається сонце.

Вчора ми були в ресторані. Нам подобалася риба. Офіціант запитав: "Вам ще?" Ми сказали так. Їм теж сподобалося наше замовлення.

Тобі потрібно приїхати сюди! Тобі тут буде добре.

До зустрічі!

*(Hello! I really like Odesa. It's warm and fun here. The sea is beautiful here — it likes the sun. Yesterday we were at a restaurant. We liked the fish. The waiter asked: "More for you?" We said yes. They also liked our order. You need to come here! You'll feel good here. See you!)*

> 🎭 **Folklore/Traditions Corner**
>
> Ukrainians traditionally wish "Щастя тобі!" (Happiness to you!) using the Dative case. Birthday wishes, wedding toasts, and New Year greetings all put the recipient in Dative. The grammar itself encodes the act of giving good wishes.

## Practice

Now that you understand the theory, let's practice recognizing and using Dative pronouns. The key is to internalize these patterns until they become automatic.

### Common Dative Expressions

Below are the most frequently used Dative expressions in everyday Ukrainian. These are the building blocks you'll use constantly. Memorize them as complete chunks rather than translating word-by-word:

- **Мені подобається...** — I like...
- **Тобі потрібно...** — You need to...
- **Йому/Їй холодно** — He/She is cold
- **Нам весело** — We're having fun
- **Вам зрозуміло?** — Is it clear to you?
- **Їм цікаво** — They find it interesting

### Verbs That Love Dative

Certain Ukrainian verbs always take their object in the Dative case. Unlike English (where "to help someone" uses a direct object), Ukrainian uses the Dative for the person being helped, thanked, or bothered. Learn these verbs and their Dative requirement together:

| Verb | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| подобатися | to be liked | Мені подобається. |
| здаватися | to seem | Мені здається... |
| допомагати | to help | Я допомагаю йому. |
| заважати | to bother | Не заважай мені! |
| дякувати | to thank | Дякую тобі! |

## Production

Now it's time to produce your own Dative sentences. This is where the learning becomes permanent — when you create sentences yourself rather than just recognizing them.

**Your production goals:**
1. Express what you like using "мені подобається" + a noun or infinitive
2. Express what you need using "мені потрібно" + an infinitive or noun
3. Describe how you feel using "мені" + an adverb (холодно, тепло, добре, погано, цікаво)

**Tips for success:**
- Start with the Dative pronoun (мені, тобі, etc.)
- Add the verb or adverb
- If using подобатися, put the liked thing in Nominative case
- If using потрібно, follow with an infinitive or noun

**Example sentences:**
Мені подобається українська мова. (I like Ukrainian.)
Мені потрібно більше практики. (I need more practice.)
Мені цікаво вчити нові слова. (I find it interesting to learn new words.)

# Підсумок

У цьому модулі ви навчилися:

1. **Займенники в давальному відмінку:** мені, тобі, йому, їй, нам, вам, їм
2. **Виражати уподобання:** Мені подобається + називний
3. **Виражати потреби:** Мені потрібно + інфінітив/іменник
4. **Фізичні та емоційні стани:** Мені холодно, тобі весело, йому сумно
5. **Дієслова з давальним:** подобатися, здаватися, допомагати, заважати, дякувати

**Головна думка:** В українській мові переживання «трапляються» особі. Особа стоїть у давальному відмінку. Емоції та відчуття діють на нас.
