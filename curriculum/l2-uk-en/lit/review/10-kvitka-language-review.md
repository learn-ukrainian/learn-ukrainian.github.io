| ------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Coherence           | 10/10 | Logical flow from historical context -> linguistics -> character study -> synthesis.                                             |
| Relevance           | 10/10 | Directly addresses the module's core theme: language as a political choice.                                                      |
| Educational         | 10/10 | Excellent explanation of "skaz" and stylistic differences between burlesque and sentimentalism.                                  |

| Pedagogy            | 9/10  | Strong analysis, though the connection between "Slobzhansky dialect" and modern norm could be even more explicit in the summary. |
| Immersion           | 10/10 | 99.9% Ukrainian. Appropriate for LIT track.                                                                                      |

| Propaganda Filter   | 10/10 | Clean. Actively deconstructs colonial myths ("малоросійське наріччя").                                                           |
