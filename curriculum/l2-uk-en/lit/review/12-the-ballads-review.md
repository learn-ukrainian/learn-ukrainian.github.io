## 2. Qualitative Analysis

### Strengths

- **Thematic Depth**: The module goes beyond plot summary to analyze the _philosophy_ of the ballads (dvoieviria, metamorphosis, fatalism).
- **Comparative Context**: The contrast between Classicism and Romanticism provides excellent intellectual scaffolding.
- **Linguistic Analysis**: The "Demonology" section effectively explains the cultural code behind the texts.

### Weaknesses (Addressed)

- Initial word count was low; expanded by ~1500 words to meet rigorous C1 standards.
- Outline matching required simplification of headers to strictly match metadata.

## 3. Conclusion

The module is ready for production. It meets all "Theory-First" requirements and provides a rich, immersive experience for the learner.
