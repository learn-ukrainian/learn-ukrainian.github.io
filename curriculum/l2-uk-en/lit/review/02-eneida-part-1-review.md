| ------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Experience Quality  | 9/10  | Compelling seminar narrative with sustained intellectual tension. Opening metaphor (камертон) immediately anchors the reader; the progression from textual analysis to cultural interpretation maintains momentum across all 6 sections                                                                 |
| Coherence           | 10/10 | Excellent six-section flow: introduction establishes stakes → character analysis → institutional satire → linguistic analysis → structural walkthrough → thematic synthesis. Each section builds on the previous; transitions are smooth and purposeful                                                 |
| Relevance           | 10/10 | All 6 sections match plan outline exactly. All 10 required vocabulary terms used in context. All 5 recommended vocabulary terms integrated. Module directly continues from LIT-01 biographical foundation into first close-reading                                                                      |
| Educational         | 9/10  | Strong scaffolding from concrete textual excerpts to abstract cultural analysis. Four-register framework (канцелярська, народна, семінарська латина, козацький жаргон) provides excellent analytical tool. Dидона analysis is particularly sophisticated                                                |
| Language            | 9/10  | Natural Ukrainian at C1+ register. Rich hedging markers throughout (ймовірно, щоправда, утім, зрештою, з одного боку, певною мірою, за всією вірогідністю, водночас, можливо). Naturalness score 10/10 from audit. No Russianisms detected                                                              |
| Pedagogy            | 9/10  | Seminar-appropriate: reading input → critical analysis → essay production. Source reading with 5 graduated tasks anchors all analytical work. Two critical-analysis activities approach the text from different angles (institutional vs. linguistic). Essay prompt is open-ended and thought-provoking |
| Immersion           | 10/10 | 99.6% Ukrainian immersion. Only non-Ukrainian elements are Latin quotes from the poem itself (Arma virumque cano, Енеус ностер магнус панус) and European proper nouns — all contextually necessary                                                                                                     |
| Activities          | 9/10  | 4 activities (3 types: reading, critical-analysis, essay-response). All seminar-appropriate. Model answers are substantive and demonstrate expected analytical depth. Essay rubric has 3 clear criteria. Reading tasks progress from observation to interpretation                                      |
| Richness            | 10/10 | 99% richness score. 6 engagement boxes (important, quote, cultural, tip, note, warning/myth-buster) plus resources callout. Extensive primary source quotes woven throughout. Visual formatting with blockquotes and bold emphasis aids navigation                                                      |
| Humanity            | 9/10  | Warm intellectual tone throughout. Teacher voice present in rhetorical questions ("Чому Котляревський обрав саме сміх?"), direct address, and guiding commentary. Not overly sentimental but genuinely passionate about the material                                                                    |
| LLM Fingerprint     | 9/10  | Authentic academic Ukrainian style. No "let's dive in" or similar English-derived cliches. Structural parallelism present but natural for Ukrainian literary criticism. Varied sentence length and paragraph structure. Авторські відступи section reads particularly naturally                         |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 9/10  | Primary source quotes match known text of Eneida. Historical claims verified: Sich destruction (1775), Hetmanate abolition (1764), first publication (1798), Parpura's unauthorized publication. No fabricated quotes — all marked as from Part I text                                                  |
| Propaganda Filter   | 10/10 | Explicitly decolonized throughout: empire named as oppressor, myth-buster debunks "Kotliarevsky copied Osipov" claim, Olympus-as-Chancellery allegory explained with explicit imperial reference. Ukrainian agency foregrounded in every section. No imperial euphemisms                                |
| Semantic Nuance     | 9/10  | Rich hedging throughout all sections. Estimated 25+ hedging markers across 4600 words (≈5.4 per 1000 words, exceeding the 5/1000 requirement). Includes: ймовірно, можливо, утім, щоправда, водночас, певною мірою, за всією вірогідністю, зрештою, з одного боку, мабуть                               |

## Issues Found and Assessed

### Issue 1: Section Word Count Warnings (P2)

**Location:** Sections 1, 2, 3 (Вступ, Еней, Олімп)
**Details:** Three sections slightly under individual word allocations by 79-130 words each
**Impact:** Minor — overall word count passes at 4607/4500
**Assessment:** Audit correctly flags these as WARNINGS, not errors. The shortfall per section is <15%, well within acceptable variance. Content density in these sections is high — no padding needed
**Status:** Accepted (no fix needed)

### Issue 2: Historical Cyrillic Characters (P1)

**Location:** Content line ~137 (словничок reference)
**Original:** `«Собраніє Малороссійскихъ словъ»`
**Problem:** Historical Cyrillic `ъ` characters flagged by audit outside blockquote
**Fix:** Moved into blockquote context in previous session
**Status:** Fixed (in Phase 2)

### Issue 3: Comparative-study Activity Type Not Used (P2)

**Location:** Activities YAML
**Details:** 4 priority types available (comparative-study, critical-analysis, essay-response, reading); only 3 used
**Assessment:** Comparative-study would be appropriate for Вергілій-vs-Котляревський comparison, but the critical-analysis activities effectively cover this ground. Not a gate failure — audit shows "Priority types used: 3/4 ✅"
**Status:** Accepted (optional improvement for future iteration)

### Issue 4: No Audio Resources (P3)

**Location:** Module-wide
**Details:** Audit notes "ℹ️ No audio" — informational, not an error
**Assessment:** LIT track is text-based literary analysis. Audio of Eneida recitation could enhance the module but is not required by schema
**Status:** Not applicable for LIT track

## Content Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **First-strophe analysis** (Еней section): The word-by-word breakdown of "парубок моторний / хоть куди козак / зле проворний / бурлак" is pedagogically excellent — each word becomes a lens into national character
2. **Olympus-as-Chancellery** allegory: The mapping table (Зевс=Імператор, Юнона=русифікація, etc.) provides a clear analytical framework students can apply independently
3. **Дідона's complexity**: Treatment as "жіночий двійник Енея" with shared epithet "моторна" is sophisticated literary analysis appropriate for C1+ level
4. **Corruption-as-engine** thesis: The analysis of хабар (bribe) as narrative mechanism is original and well-argued
5. **Contemporary relevance**: Connection to 2022 humor (Байрактар memes) is powerful but not forced

### Areas for Potential Enhancement

1. Could add a comparative-study activity for systematic Vergil-Kotliarevsky comparison
2. Sound-writing (звукопис) analysis in the storm scene could be expanded with more phonetic detail
3. The resources callout could include academic literary criticism sources (e.g., Нахлік, Шевчук)

## Recommendation

PASS — Module meets all quality standards for the LIT track. Content provides a rich, decolonized close-reading of Eneida Part I with strong literary analysis, appropriate engagement hooks, and seminar-style activities. The six-section structure builds coherently from textual introduction through character/institutional analysis to thematic synthesis. Ukrainian prose is natural and at the correct C1+ register with adequate hedging markers. All audit gates pass. The module successfully transitions from LIT-01's biographical context into substantive literary analysis of the primary text.
