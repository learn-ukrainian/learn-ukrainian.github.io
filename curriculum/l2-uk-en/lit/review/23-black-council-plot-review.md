| ------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Experience Quality  | 10/10 | Exceptional narrative flow; the "warning for 2026" hook is powerful and immediately engages the reader.              |
| Coherence           | 10/10 | Logic is seamless: Plot -> Characters -> Historical Context -> Conclusion. Excellent transitions.                    |
| Relevance           | 10/10 | Perfectly aligned with the requirement to analyze "The Black Council" as a seminal historical novel.                 |
| Educational         | 10/10 | Explains complex political concepts (ochlocracy, populism) through literary analysis very effectively.               |
| Language            | 9/10  | High-register literary Ukrainian. Terms like "химерна вдача", "зимовий цикл" (in context of history) used correctly. |
| Pedagogy            | 10/10 | Seminar-style synthesis. The module treats the student as an intellectual equal.                                     |
| Immersion           | 10/10 | 99.9% Ukrainian. English is used only where absolutely necessary (metadata/hidden).                                  |
| Activities          | 10/10 | Activities (Essay, Critical Analysis) are perfectly suited for C1/LIT level.                                         |
| Richness            | 9/10  | Meets the 99% richness target. Good use of quotes and cultural callouts.                                             |
| Humanity            | 10/10 | The voice is passionate, patriotic, and authoritative, not robotic.                                                  |
| LLM Fingerprint     | 9/10  | Feels like a human literary critic wrote it. Minimal "AI-isms".                                                      |
| Linguistic Accuracy | 10/10 | Historical terminology (старшина, наказний гетьман) used with precision.                                             |
| Propaganda Filter   | 10/10 | Strong anti-colonial stance. The "Myth Buster" about Zaporozhians is excellent deconstruction of populist myths.     |
| Semantic Nuance     | 10/10 | Nuanced character analysis (Tur is not just a hero, Somko is not just a victim).                                     |
