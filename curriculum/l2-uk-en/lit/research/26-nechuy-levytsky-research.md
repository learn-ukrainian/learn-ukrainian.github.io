# Research Notes: Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky (Module 26)

## 1. Biography & Context

- **Dates**: 1838 (Stebliv) – 1918 (Kyiv).
- **Origin**: Clerical family (father Semen was educated, pro-Ukrainian, ran a school for peasants).
- **Education**: Bohuslav Theological School, Kyiv Theological Seminary (1853-1859), Kyiv Theological Academy (1861-1865).
- **Career**: Refused priesthood ("rebellion"). Taught Russian literature in Poltava, Kalisz, Siedlce, Chisinau.
- **The "Alien" Cities**: Lived outside Ukraine proper (Poland, Moldova) for 20 years, deepening his nostalgia and "virtual Ukraine" via writing.
- **Kyiv Period (1885-1918)**: "The Hermit of Kyiv". Lived on Volodymyrstra Hill. Iconic routine: umbrella, daily walk, strict schedule.
- **End of Life**: Died in poverty in a shelter (Degtyarivska bogadilnya) during the chaos of 1918.

## 2. The Language War ("The Crooked Mirror")

- **Stance**: Radical rejection of "Galician" influences (letter "ї", foreign syntax, "artificial" terms).
- **Argument**: Literary language must be based on the living vernacular of Kyiv/Poltava peasants. "Artificial" language alienates the people.
- **Work**: "Kryve dzerkalo ukrainskoi movy" (1912).
- **Status**: Tragic conservatism. He fought for "purity" but lost to historical evolution (synthesis of dialects).
- **Quote**: "Ukrainian language must be a mirror of the people's soul... now we see a crooked mirror."

## 3. Literary Analysis

- **Style**: "Visual" Realism. Franko called him "The All-Seeing Eye of Ukraine" («Колосальне всеобіймаюче око»).
- **Method**: "Sociological Psychologism". Characters revealed through appearance, objects, and speech, not internal monologue.
- **"Kaidasheva simya"**:
  - **Genre**: Social-household novella (chronicle of degradation).
  - **Conflict**: Material dependence, egoism, "individualism without culture", generational gap.
  - **Humor**: "Laughter through tears". The absurdity of petty conflicts (the pear tree, the pot) vs. universal tragedy.
  - **Characters**: Omelko (tradition/alcohol), Kaidashykha (pretentious "pani ekonomsha"), Motrya (active aggression), Melashka (lyrical victim -> adaptation).
- **"Mykola Dzherya"**:
  - **Theme**: The psychological legacy of serfdom vs. the thirst for freedom.
  - **Plot**: Flight to Bessarabia (archetype of the Cossack seeking liberty).
- **Landscape**: Not decoration, but a character. "Painting with words".

## 5. Engagement Hooks (Planned)

- [!myth-buster]: Nechuy was not a "funny old man" but a radical non-conformist who refused a safe clerical career.
- [!history-bite]: The "Alphabet Wars" and his refusal to print books with the letter "ї".
- [!cultural]: "Kaidasheva simya" as the ultimate meme generator (the pear tree, "bitch mother-in-law").
- [!quote]: Franko about Nechuy: "To read him is to see Ukraine."
