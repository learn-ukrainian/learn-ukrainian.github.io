## Section 1: Вступ — Чому 1798 рік? (750 words)

### Historical Context of Eneida's Publication

- First 3 parts published **St. Petersburg, 1798** — without author's permission
- Funded by **Maksym Parpura** (Konotop landowner)
- Part 4: 1809; Parts 5-6: completed ~1820; Full posthumous edition with glossary: Kharkiv, 1842

### State of Ukrainian Culture in Late 18th Century

- **1764:** Abolition of Hetmanate — Catherine II forced last hetman Kyrylo Rozumovsky to resign
- **1775:** Destruction of Zaporizhian Sich — General Tekeli surrounded Sich on Trinity Sunday, treacherous night raid after Cossacks helped win Russo-Turkish war
- **1783:** Introduction of serfdom on Left Bank — millions of free Cossacks/peasants reduced to chattel
- Old Baroque Ukrainian literature dying (Skovotoda, Prokopovych, Velychkovsky) — written in artificial "bookish" Ukrainian
- New Ukrainian elite (former Cossack starshyna) massively Russifying: Kapnist, Gogol's father, Bezborodko
- Ukrainian language relegated to "peasant dialect" — sign of low birth, ignorance, provincialism
- Term "Ukraine" banned, replaced by "Malorossiya"

### Why This "Joke" Became the Beginning of New Literature

- Published during deepest cultural crisis — language nearly extinct in literature
- Demonstrated Ukrainian could carry epic literature
- Legitimized living folk language vs. dead "bookish" language
- Comparable to moments when Cornish, Prussian, Polabian languages died — Ukraine was on same brink

### Engagement Hooks

- [!warning] Myth Buster: "Reunification" — Pereiaslav 1654 was temporary military alliance, not voluntary reunification
- [!note] Historical Parallel: Sich destruction compared to Knights Templar dissolution

## Section 2: Біографія як драма вибору (1000 words)

### Childhood and Education in Poltava

- Born **9 September 1769** in Poltava, died **10 November 1838** in Poltava
- Father: Petro Kotliarevsky, clerk (kantsеliaryst) at magistrate — handled old Hetman-era documents
- Family: Ukrainian nobility (herb Ogonchyk), not wealthy
- Lived, worked, and died in same house on Ivanova Hora (now museum, opened 1952)
- **Seminary: 1780-1789** (IEU and EN Wikipedia; UK Wikipedia says 1789-1793 — **IEU more reliable**)
- Seminary was a powerful humanities university: Latin (knew Virgil by heart), Rhetoric/Poetics, French/German, read Voltaire in original
- Seminary nickname "Ryfmach" (Rhymester) — wrote satirical poems about teachers
- Left before finishing (didn't feel priestly calling), became private tutor (guverner) 1793-1796
- Tutoring period = "going to the people" — observed landlord life (often grotesque) and peasant life (rich in folklore), collected linguistic material that would explode in Eneida

### Military Career and Freemasonry

- **1796:** Joined Siversky Karabiner Regiment — sharp turn from peaceful tutor life
- Served 12 years (1796-1808), not garrison duty — real combat
- **Russo-Turkish War:** Siege of Izmail, Bendery; staff-captain rank
- **Key discovery:** Regiment included "Budzhak Cossacks" — former Zaporozhians who'd crossed Danube after Sich destruction, lived in Turkey, returned
- From them: heard living language (juicy, rough, military jargon, Turkish loans: гайдамака, казан, тютюн), saw real Cossack life (dirt, blood, horilka, card games, but also wild bravery and sacred brotherhood)
- "Trench truth" — his Trojans are specific people from his regiment
- **Diplomatic mission to Budzhak Tatars** — persuaded them to switch sides, risking life → Order of St. Anna 3rd class
- **1812:** Organized **5th Ukrainian Cossack Regiment** in Horoshyn, received major rank
- Condition: regiment would remain permanent Cossack force (broken after war — disbandment, betrayal)
- **1818:** Masonic lodge **"Liubov do istyny" (Love of Truth)** with Vasyl Lukashevych, V. Taranovsky
- Members included future Decembrists (Muravyovs, Pestel, Volkonsky)
- Discussed: abolition of serfdom, limiting absolute monarchy, national self-determination
- Lodge closed 1822 by Alexander I; Kotliarevsky placed under secret police surveillance
- Member of **Malorussian Secret Society** (per Matvii Muravyov-Apostol testimony)

### Theater Activity and Enlightenment

- 1810: trustee of institution for education of children of impoverished nobles — 25+ years
- Transformed decrepit institution into model school; humanistic pedagogy (no beating children)
- Graduates: mathematician Ostrogradsky, artist Mokrytsky
- **Poltava Free Theater director 1812-1821** (IEU says from 1812; UK Wiki says 1816)
- Created _Natalka Poltavka_ (1819) and _Moskal-charivnyk_ — landmarks in Ukrainian theater
- Natalka Poltavka: response to Shakhovskoi's caricatures of Ukrainian life
- Combined intermede tradition with folklore
- **1822:** Helped buy actor **Mikhail Shchepkin** out of serfdom
- 1827-1835: directed philanthropic agencies
- Before death: **freed his serfs**, distributed property to relatives

### Engagement Hooks

- [!quote] Catherine II's secret instruction to Rumyantsev about erasing hetman memory
- Seminary as "powerful humanities university" — counter to stereotype of boring prayer school

## Section 3: Феномен "Котляревщини" (875 words)

### What Are Burlesque and Travesty

- **Travesty:** literary parody that takes a serious/noble subject and renders it in low/comic style
- Term originates from Scarron's _Virgile travesti_ (1648) — French word "travestir" = to disguise
- **Burlesque:** broader category of humorous/mocking literary work; can elevate the low (mock-epic) or debase the high (travesty)
- Kotliarevsky's Eneida = travesty specifically — takes Virgil's sacred epic and "dresses it" in Cossack clothing
- But transcends mere parody — becomes vehicle for national revival

### Living Folk Language vs. Bookish Language

- Pre-Kotliarevsky hierarchy: Church Slavonic (for God), Russian (for Tsar), French (for Salon); Ukrainian = "for cattle"
- Old "bookish Ukrainian" = artificial mix of Church Slavonic, Polonisms, Latinisms — dead for life
- Kotliarevsky used **Poltava dialect** of middle Naddniprianshchyna — this dialect became basis for modern literary standard
- Linguistic richness: 50+ synonyms for "to hit" (мотлошити, гамселити, лупцювати, дати ляща, вшити смальцю...)
- **Macaronic language:** mixed Latin with Ukrainian (e.g., "Енеус ностер магнус панус") — showed Ukrainian could coexist with classical Latin
- Result: legitimization — Ukrainian received "passport" to great literature

### Role of Laughter as Cultural Weapon

- Post-defeat psychology: depression, self-pity — "oh poor us, we are oppressed"
- Kotliarevsky's radical antidote: **Laughter**
- Depicted Cossacks (as Trojans) not as tragic weeping victims but as **vital heroes**
- Lost Troy (Sich)? They'll find a new one! Pursued by Juno (Tsarina)? Show her the fig!
- Psychological breakthrough: taught Ukrainians to laugh at enemies; laughter kills fear
- "Laughter therapy" — transformed tragedy of lost statehood into burlesque adventure
- Underworld scenes = social satire (Hell = Russian Empire bureaucracy; Heaven = Cossack utopia)

### Engagement Hooks

- [!tip] Linguistic nuance about Poltava dialect becoming literary standard
- Encyclopedic nature of Eneida: 100+ dishes/drinks, clothing, customs — "Noah's Ark" of culture

## Section 4: "Енеїда" в європейському контексті (750 words)

### European Tradition of Virgil Travesty

- **Giovanni Battista Lalli:** _L'Eneide travestita_ (1633, Italian) — first Virgil travesty
- **Paul Scarron:** _Virgile travesti_ (1648, French) — 8 books of 12 planned, gave rise to English term "travesty"; Scarron was physically disabled, used humor as coping mechanism; enormously popular, spawned imitators across Europe
- **Aloys Blumauer:** _Abenteuer des frommen Helden Æneas_ (1784-88, Austrian/German) — Illuminati member, Freemason, anti-Jesuit satires; died same year Kotliarevsky's Eneida published (1798); his travesty was political weapon against Jesuits
- **N.P. Osipov + A.A. Kotelnitsky:** _Вергилиева Энеида, вывороченная наизнанку_ (1791-96, Russian) — direct model for Kotliarevsky but completely different and vastly inferior artistically; IEU: "much more artistically accomplished than Osipov's version"
- Also: anonymous Belarusian _Eneida navyvarat_ (inspired by Kotliarevsky, not a Virgil original)

### Uniqueness of the Ukrainian Variant

- Unlike European predecessors: not just comic entertainment or political pamphlet
- Kotliarevsky's travesty = **national revival instrument**
- Trojans = Zaporozhian Cossacks (not generic comic figures)
- Olympian gods = merciless landlords / imperial bureaucrats
- Memory of destroyed Sich and Hetmanate woven throughout
- Introduced **accentual-syllabic verse** (iambic tetrameter) in 10-line strophes, replacing older syllabic versification — revolutionary for Ukrainian prosody
- Full of specific Ukrainian realia: food, clothing, customs, social relations — making it ethnographic document
- IEU characterizes Kotliarevsky as "more Baroque-influenced Classicist than Romantic"

### Cossack Instead of Roman

- Virgil's pious Aeneas → Kotliarevsky's "парубок моторний... хлопець хоть куди козак"
- Deliberate lowering of pathos: imperial ode style = language of lies; only burlesque (low style) could speak truth
- Republican/democratic idea hidden behind jokes: Cossacks ELECT Eney as otaman (not appointed by god)
- Influence of French Enlightenment (Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu) — "social contract" permeates the poem
- Kozak battle tactics in poem mirror real Zaporozhian tactics, not mythical Trojan War

### Engagement Hooks

- Timeline: Lalli (1633) → Scarron (1648) → Blumauer (1784) → Osipov (1791) → Kotliarevsky (1798)
- [!note] Scarron wrote his travesty while physically disabled — parallel with Kotliarevsky writing from position of cultural oppression

## Section 5: Роль особистості в культурі (625 words)

### Assimilation vs. Resistance

- Late 18th c. Ukrainian elite: massive Russification for career advancement
- Kapnist, Gogol's father, Bezborodko — switched to Russian (language of power, Petersburg, success)
- Kotliarevsky had every reason to assimilate: military career, orders, noble status
- Instead: refused to translate Eneida into Russian despite lucrative offers — "It was written for Ukrainians"
- Freed his serfs before death; bought Shchepkin out of serfdom
- Military autonomy attempt: 5th Cossack Regiment (1812) = attempt to restore Ukrainian army

### "Person of Action" — Kotliarevsky as Archetype

- Not typical "national awakener" — no fiery manifestos (unlike Mikhnovsky), not exiled (unlike Shevchenko)
- Appeared perfectly loyal to empire — but this was a mask
- "Cultural partisan" — operated deep behind enemy lines using available means (laughter, theater, Masonic lodges)
- Combined action across multiple domains: literary, military, educational, theatrical, civic
- His house on Ivanova Hora = "genius loci" — rare rootedness in mobile 19th century
- Long-term strategist: empire fell, tsars shot, Soviet Union collapsed — Eney and his boys live on

### Influence on Subsequent Generations

- **Shevchenko:** Born 1814 when Eneida already cult book; memorized it in childhood; poem "Na vichnu pamiat Kotliarevskomu" (1838); called him "Father"
- Kotliarevsky preserved language + showed Cossack heroism → Shevchenko added wrath + prophecy
- **Kvitka-Osnovianenko, Hulak-Artemovsky, Hrebinka** — all "came from Kotliarevsky's overcoat"
- Created matrix: folk language + realistic heroes + love for native land
- Matrix worked for over a century until expanded by modernists (Kotsiubynsky, Lesia Ukrainka)
- Even modernists acknowledged Kotliarevsky's primacy
- Also influenced: Kukharenko, Gogol, Narezhny, anonymous Belarusian Eneida

### Engagement Hooks

- [!warning] Myth Buster: "Shalvarshchyna" — myth that Kotliarevsky reduced Ukrainians to clowns; truth: burlesque was the only PERMITTED genre; behind clown's mask was a knight's face

---

## Section 6: Підсумок — Від жарту до нації (500 words)

### Significance for Ukrainian National Revival

- "Point of bifurcation" — launched chain reaction that could no longer be stopped
- Proved Ukrainian language could carry great literature
- Preserved cultural encyclopedia of 18th-century Ukraine (100+ dishes, clothing, customs)
- Psychological liberation: laughter therapy against inferiority complex
- Shifted from military to cultural resistance — "what regiments couldn't do, one book did"

### His Place in the Literary Canon

- "Father of new Ukrainian literature" (Shevchenko's title)
- Soviet/Russian attempts to domesticate: portrayed as loyal "Malorossian" writing funny verses — this is a lie
- IEU: "more Baroque-influenced Classicist than Romantic" — nuanced literary positioning
- Museum in Poltava since 1952
- His works remain required reading in Ukrainian schools

### Transition to Eneida Analysis

- This module = foundation for understanding all subsequent Ukrainian culture development
- Next module (LIT-02): detailed analysis of Eneida Part I — plot and structure
- Connection to LIT-05: Natalka Poltavka and transition to sentimentalism
- Framework established: historical context + biography + literary phenomenon → ready for close reading

### Engagement Hooks

- Gritsak's characterization: Kotliarevsky as "person of modernization" — Ukrainianness as dynamic force
- Contemporary relevance: again fighting for subjectivity, refuting imperial myths, seeking support in own culture
- Wartime vitality: ability to laugh at enemy = Kotliarevsky's legacy alive today
