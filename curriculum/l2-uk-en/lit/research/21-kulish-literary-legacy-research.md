## 2. Panteleimon the Linguist: "Kulishivka"

- **Innovation**: First phonetic alphabet. "Write as you hear".
- **Works**: "Notes on Southern Rus" (1856), "Gramatka" (1857).
- **Key Rules**:
  - Abolished "ы" (yery) -> used "и" for [ɪ].
  - Used "і" for [i] (from classic "yat" ѣ).
  - Used "є", "ї".
  - Abolished "ъ" at the end of words.
- **Impact**: Banned by Ems Ukaz (1876). Became the basis of modern Ukrainian orthography.

## 3. Panteleimon the Translator

- **Philosophy**: "To let Shakespare speak Ukrainian" -> proving the language is capable of high culture, not just peasant talk.
- **Shakespeare**: Translated 13 plays (Hamlet, Othello, Romeo and Juliet, etc.).
  - _Quote_: "We want to show the world that our language is not just for domestic use."
- ** The Bible**:
  - Lifelong project.
  - Partners: Ivan Puluj (physicist), Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky.
  - Fate of manuscript: Burned during a fire at his khutor Motronivka? (Check fact: One version burned, he rewrote it).

## 4. "Khutorna Philosophy" (Khutir Philosophy)

- **Works**: "Letters from a Khutor" (1861), "Khutir Philosophy and Poetry Away from the World" (1879).
- **Core Idea**: The "Khutir" (farmstead) is the reservoir of national spirit and morality. Current civilization (city) is corrupting.
- **Dual Nature**:
  - Romantic populism (early): Idealizing the people.
  - Elitist skepticism (late): The "mob" vs "culture".
- **Cossackophobia**: Later in life, he turned against the idealization of Cossack rebellions (Haidamaky), viewing them as destructive anarchy. Promoted "Cultural work" over "Rebellion".
  - _Controversy_: This alienated him from many contemporaries (like Kostomarov and old Shevchenko fans).

## 5. Relationship with Shevchenko & "Osnova"

- **Dynamics**:
  - Shevchenko = The Heart, The Prophet, The Element (Stykhia).
  - Kulish = The Mind, The Critic, The European.
- **Wedding**: Shevchenko was best man.
- **Journal "Osnova" (1861-1862)**: First Ukrainian socio-political journal in Empire.
  - Published Shevchenko's "Kobzar" (1860 edition funded by Symyrenko was organized by Kulish).
  - Published over 70 of Shevchenko's poems.
- **Quote**: Kulish on Shevchenko to the grave: "Leaving us, he left us his testament..." (check exact quote about carrying on the work).
