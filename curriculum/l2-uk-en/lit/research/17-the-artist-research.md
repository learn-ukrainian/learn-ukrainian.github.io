## PART I: SHEVCHENKO AS VISUAL ARTIST

### 1. Training Under Karl Bryullov (1838-1845)

#### The Path to Freedom and the Academy

**The Lottery for Freedom (April-May 1838):**
- In 1837, Ukrainian artist **Ivan Soshenko** introduced Shevchenko to V. I. Grigorovich (Academy of Arts conference secretary) with the goal of freeing him from serfdom
- Landowner **Pavel Engelhardt** was difficult to persuade and refused to sell "too cheap" - even when the famous academician Karl Bryullov personally petitioned him
- Poet **Vasily Zhukovsky** and Count **M. Y. Vielgorsky** arranged a lottery solution
- Karl Bryullov painted a portrait of Zhukovsky specifically for the imperial family to raffle in a private lottery
- The lottery raised **2,500 rubles** (the exact sum Engelhardt demanded)
- **Freedom purchased: April 22, 1838** (some sources say May 5, 1838)
- Shevchenko enrolled at the **Imperial Academy of Arts in 1838** immediately after gaining freedom

**Shevchenko's Gratitude:**
- Dedicated his early ballad **"Kateryna" (1838)** to Vasily Zhukovsky in memory of the purchase of his freedom
- This event became central to his later novella "The Artist" (1856)

#### Bryullov as Mentor and Teacher

**The "Bryullov Period" at the Academy:**
- Bryullov's teaching approach was distinctive for the Academy - he introduced **"art to a living reality"** (not just academic formulas)
- He worked at a huge workshop at the academy, and his personal workshop was a continuation of academic classes where **issues of art were discussed**
- Bryullov tried to support the various aspirations of all students: history painting, genre painting, and other artistic endeavors
- His versatility of professional knowledge had a beneficial effect on students' interests

**Shevchenko's Studies (1838-1845):**
- Studied under Bryullov's direct supervision
- Spent most of his time at the academy and in Bryullov's studio
- Together they attended literary and musical evenings, visited writers and artists
- Shevchenko refined techniques in **watercolor, oil painting, and etching**
- Mastered **portraiture, historical compositions, and plein-air landscape painting**

**Bryullov's Stylistic Influence:**
- Shevchenko's initial style reflected **neoclassical influences** from Bryullov
- Evident in structured compositions and idealized forms
- Combined with Shevchenko's evolving interests in portraiture and Ukrainian themes
- However, Shevchenko moved beyond academic conventions toward **realism**

---

### 2. Portraits and Etchings

#### The "Picturesque Ukraine" Series (Zhyvopysna Ukraina)

**Conception and Purpose (1844):**
- Distressed by the condition of Ukrainian regions in the Russian Empire, Shevchenko decided to capture historical ruins and cultural monuments
- Created an album of etchings titled **"Picturesque Ukraine" (Живописна Україна)**
- **Only the first six etchings were printed** due to lack of means to continue
- The project began after a trip to Ukraine where he was influenced by everything seen and experienced

**Planned Structure (Three Parts):**
1. **Part I:** Ukrainian landscapes showing the beauty of the country or expressing its historical meaning
2. **Part II:** Scenes from the everyday life of that period
3. **Part III:** Etchings depicting the historical past of the Ukrainian people

**Significance:**
- An attempt to create a visual encyclopedia of Ukrainian cultural monuments
- Documentary function: preserving images of historical sites
- Combined aesthetic beauty with ethnographic documentation

#### Self-Portraits: A Two-Decade Chronicle

**Scale of Self-Portrait Production:**
- Over the course of **some twenty years (from 1840-1841 to 1861)**, Shevchenko produced **approximately thirty images** that feature his head/bust
- Created in a variety of media: **pastel, ink, pencil, sepia, watercolor, etching, and oil**
- These form a unique self-documentation of an artist's life journey

**Notable Self-Portraits:**

1. **"Self-Portrait with a Candle" (1845, etching; also 1860)**
   - One of Shevchenko's most symbolic etching portraits
   - Executed after a drawing of his childhood years that has not been preserved
   - Shevchenko depicted with a candle raised high in his hand
   - **Symbolic meaning:** The lighted candle represents Shevchenko starting out on the road of creative work - light in the darkness
   - Technical details: Created on paper using **etching and aquatint techniques**
   - Dimensions: 16.4 x 13 cm and 22.5 x 16.2 cm
   - Version executed not earlier than June 1860 in Petersburg

2. **"Self-Portrait in a Hat and Sheepskin Coat" (etching)**
   - Also singled out as a notable etching portrait
   - Shows Shevchenko in traditional Ukrainian dress

3. **Self-Portrait (Winter 1840/1841)**
   - One of his earliest self-portraits
   - From his academy period

#### Portrait Work and Technique

**General Portrait Practice:**
- Shevchenko produced portraits of various subjects using multiple techniques
- His etching technique was particularly innovative
- In 1860 he was awarded the title of **Academician in the Imperial Academy of Arts specifically for his achievements in etching**
- May be considered to have **pioneered the art of etching in the Russian Empire**

**Versatility in Media:**
- Produced portraits, compositions on mythological, historical, and household themes
- Architectural drawings and landscapes
- Used: **oils on canvas, watercolour, sepia, ink, pencil, and etchings**

---

### 3. Landscapes and Watercolors from Exile (1847-1857)

#### The Exile Decree

**Nicholas I's Harsh Punishment (Summer 1847):**
- At age 33, by tsarist decree, Shevchenko was exiled to Kazakhstan in a separate Orenburg corps as an ordinary soldier
- **"Under the rigorous surveillance of his superiors, with the prohibition of writing and drawing"**
- **Tsar Nicholas I himself personally ordered** that Shevchenko be forbidden to write, draw, and paint while in military exile
- This was an exceptionally harsh punishment specifically targeting his artistic talents
- The intent was to destroy the artist by forbidding his art

#### The Aral Sea Expedition (1848-1849): Circumventing the Ban

**Art Under Surveillance:**
- Despite prohibitions, owing to Shevchenko's skill as a painter, he was included in a **military expedition to survey and describe the Aral Sea (1848–49)**
- This provided legitimate cover for his artistic work - he was officially drawing for scientific purposes
- After an **18-month voyage (1848–49)**, Shevchenko returned with his album of drawings and paintings to Orenburg

**Documentary Function:**
- Among the many sketches and watercolours he made during the trip were ones of the **forbidding landscape of the Aral Sea and its shores**
- Shevchenko's sketches and paintings of the Aral Sea were **dispatched to headquarters with a petition to have the exile's lot alleviated**
- The work served both scientific/documentary and personal purposes (evidence of his usefulness)

#### Other Expeditions and Fortress Life

**Kara-Tau Hills Expedition:**
- During another expedition into the **Kara-Tau Hills** that discovered several coal-fields in Kazakhstan
- Created a great number of watercolor landscape paintings
- Again, official scientific purpose provided cover for artistic expression

**Novopetrovsky Fortress (1850-1857):**
- Shevchenko lived at the **Novopetrovsky fortress** between 1850 and 1857
- He managed to **escape the vigilance of the Tsar's agents** and was able to write numerous poems and create drawings/watercolors that he **kept hidden**
- Created well-known watercolor painting: **"Novopetrovsky Fortress Viewed from the Sea"**
- This portrayed the fort where he spent **seven long hard years**
- Acts of creative resistance against the imperial prohibition

#### Subject Matter During Exile

**Indigenous Kazakh Life:**
- Many of the drawings and paintings made while in exile depict **the life of the indigenous Kazakhs**
- Depicted the folkways of the Kirghiz and Kazak people
- Notable works depicting Kazakh life:
  - **"By the Fire" (1849)**
  - **"Kazak on a Horse" (1849)**
  - **"The Baigush" (1853)** [Baigush = traditional Kazakh gathering/celebration]
  - **"The Baigush under the Window" (1856)**
- "Tarass devoted his talent and the most fruitful part of his life to painting everyday life, traditions and rituals of the Kazakhs of the peninsula"

**Landscapes of Central Asia:**
- Created watercolor landscapes of Central Asian steppes
- Documented the forbidding landscapes of the Aral Sea region
- These works have ethnographic and geographic value

**The Irony:**
- The exile meant to destroy the artist instead produced a unique body of work documenting Central Asian life and landscape
- Art survived even under the most oppressive conditions

---

### 4. Connection Between Word and Image

#### The "Double Talent"

**Scale of Dual Achievement:**
- Shevchenko "stands as a monumental figure at the crossroads of literature, visual art, and national awakening"
- His groundbreaking poetry collection **Kobzar** (published 1840) "reshaped Ukrainian literature"
- His extensive body of **over a thousand paintings and engravings** bridged artistic expression with early ethnographic science

**Specific Numbers:**
- Researchers estimate Shevchenko created **1,200-1,300 works** between 1830 and 1861
- **835 works have survived** to this day as originals or as prints/copies made during his lifetime
- **270 other works are lost**

#### Visual Art Influencing Poetry

**Painterly Imagery in Verse:**
- "After enrolling at the prestigious Imperial Academy of Arts in 1838, Shevchenko refined his techniques in watercolor, oil painting, and etching—skills that would later **infuse his poetry with vivid, painterly imagery**"
- His poetry demonstrates visual thinking and compositional structure
- Descriptive passages in poetry show a painter's eye for detail, light, color

**Integration of Forms:**
- "Shevchenko **fused the lyrical passion of Romantic poetics with the unflinching gaze of a realist painter**, using his art to expose social injustices and ignite hope among the downtrodden"

#### Poetry Inspiring Visual Art

**Direct Connections:**
- The poem **"Kateryna"** (1838) served as a basis for a **painting of the same name** (1842)
- This demonstrates how his poetry directly inspired visual compositions
- The relationship was bidirectional - not just visual training influencing poetry, but poetic themes generating paintings

#### Ekphrasis and Documentary Function

**Visual Description in Poetry:**
- Whether etching crumbling churches or intricate peasant embroidery, Shevchenko **blended aesthetic beauty with documentary rigor**
- Offered a **visual companion to the cultural revival** his poetry championed

**Ethnographic Function:**
- His visual art served as documentation of Ukrainian culture, monuments, and peasant life
- Combined with poetry that celebrated and preserved Ukrainian language and traditions
- Both forms worked toward the same goal of cultural preservation and national awakening

#### Professional Recognition

**Academic Title (1860):**
- On **September 2, 1860**, the Council of the Academy of Arts granted Shevchenko the title **"Academician of Engraving"**
- This recognition came very late in his life - he died just months later on **March 10, 1861** at 5:30 a.m. in his St. Petersburg apartment
- The title specifically honored his **achievements in etching**
- Shevchenko pioneered the art of etching in the Russian Empire

---

### 4. Characters: Soshenko, Bryullov, and the Protagonist

**Ivan Soshenko (Narrator):**
- The narrator
- Modest, hardworking, the moral compass
- **"The Good Angel"** - represents salvation and mentorship
- Based on real Ivan Soshenko who discovered Shevchenko

**Karl Bryullov:**
- **"The Great Karl"**
- Portrayed with immense respect and adoration
- Represents the high world of Art
- His studio as a sanctuary

**The Artist (Protagonist):**
- Based on young Shevchenko

---

### 5. Autobiography vs Fiction: The Tragic Ending

#### Factual Backbone

- The redemption story is **strictly documentary**
- Dates, names, events match letters and diary
- Meeting Soshenko: real
- The lottery: real
- Academy enrollment: real
- This makes it valuable historical source

#### Fictional Layer: The Decline

- The hero marries Pasha (a fallen woman/model)
- Loses his artistic way
- Sinks into domestic swamp
- Madness and death in asylum

#### Meaning of the Fiction

**Why does the fictional hero die while real Shevchenko survived?**

1. **A Warning:** "What could have happened"
2. **Critique of "romantic vs philistine" conflict:** High ideals destroyed by mundane reality
3. **Emphasis on fragility:** The serf artist's fate hangs by a thread
4. **Universal tragedy:** Not just Shevchenko's story, but every talented serf's potential story
5. **Exile reflection:** Perhaps reflects Shevchenko's feeling of creative death during exile (written 1856, in exile)

---

### 6. Themes: The Artist's Path in the Empire

#### Serfdom

- The crushing weight of unfreedom
- **Even after legal release:** psychological trauma remains
- The serf mentality as internal prison
- Social status as destiny

#### Art as Temple

- **Idealization of art:** Bryullov's studio as a sanctuary
- Art as the only path to transcendence
- The Academy as sacred space
- Contrast with the "dirty" reality outside

#### Routine vs Muse

- The conflict between daily survival and high creativity
- Domestic life as threat to artistic vision
- The "philistine swamp" vs. the "high calling"

#### St. Petersburg: Two Faces

- **In "The Artist":** Depicted as a city of Art and Academy (during the bright period)
- **Contrast with "The Dream":** Where St. Petersburg is a gloomy city of oppression
- The duality reflects Shevchenko's complex relationship with the imperial capital

#### Empire as Setting, Soul as Ukrainian

- Even in Russian prose, the Ukrainian identity ("our compatriot") is distinct
- The "empire" is the setting, but the "soul" remains different
- **Decolonization note:** The narrative resists full assimilation

---

### 7. Style: Transition from Romanticism to Realism

#### Genre

- **Künstlerroman** (Artist's novel)
- Part of European tradition of novels about artists
- But with specific serf/empire context

#### Sentimentalism

- Emotional tone
- Narrator's pity and compassion
- Appeals to reader's feelings

#### Realism

- Detailed descriptions of the "dirty" side of life
- Asylum, poverty, madness
- Unflinching look at tragedy

#### Intertextuality

- References to Dickens
- References to Walter Scott
- Art history references
- Shows Shevchenko's wide reading

---

### 8. Legacy: The Novella in Shevchenko's Heritage

#### Source Value

- **Main source for biographers** regarding the 1838 emancipation
- Documentary evidence of the lottery
- Names, dates, events confirmed by other sources

#### Literary Value

- Shows Shevchenko's prose competence
- Demonstrates his range beyond poetry
- Russian prose written with Ukrainian consciousness

#### Reception

- **Mixed reactions:**
  - Some criticized the sentimental tone
  - Others valued the documentary aspect
- Posthumous publication limited immediate impact

#### Decolonization Reading

- Even in Russian prose, the Ukrainian identity is distinct
- The "empire" is the setting, but the "soul" remains different
- **"Our compatriot"** - maintains Ukrainian solidarity
- Resists the "Russian writer" label

---

## Final Notes

This research provides comprehensive material for a rich module on Shevchenko as visual artist and the novella "The Artist." The key is to show:

1. **Shevchenko was not just a poet** - he was a trained, professional visual artist
2. **Art and poetry were integrated** - each informed the other
3. **"The Artist" is both documentary and fiction** - real events with tragic fictional ending
4. **The tragic ending has meaning** - warns about the fragility of the artist's fate under empire
5. **Even under prohibition, art survived** - creative resistance during exile

The module should help students see Shevchenko as a **complete Renaissance figure** - poet, painter, ethnographer, and cultural documentarian. All serving one goal: preserving and elevating Ukrainian culture.
