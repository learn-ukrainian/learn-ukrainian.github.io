## Plot Outline & Key Events

### 1. Introduction: The Road to Kyiv

- **Setting:** Spring 1663, the era of the Ruin.
- **Characters:** Colonel **Shram** (pop-otaman, old respectable Cossack) and his son **Petro Shramenko** (brave, honest, romantic hero).
- **Goal:** Shram travels to support Hetman **Yakym Somko** against the anarchy promoted by Briukhovetskyi. They head to Kyiv to pray and then to the council.

### 2. The Cherevan Homestead (Khmaryshche)

- They visit **Mykhailo Cherevan**, a wealthy latifundist Cossack who prefers comfort over war.
- **Romance:** Petro falls in love with **Lesya**, Cherevan's daughter.
- **Conflict:** Social tension between the "city Cossacks" (starshyna) and the "commoners" or Zaporozhians is foreshadowed.

### 3. Kyrylo Tur: The Zaporozhian Ideal

- **Character:** **Kyrylo Tur**, a Zaporozhian Cossack, reflects the wildly free, chivalrous, but sometimes reckless spirit of the Sich.
- **Abduction:** Tur tries to kidnap Lesya (a Cossack custom/game/challenge), leading to a duel with Petro.
- **Code of Honor:** Tur respects Petro's bravery. Later, Tur sacrifices himself (or offers to) to save Somko, showing the nobility behind the roughness.

### 4. The Road to Nizhyn (Pereiaslav to Nizhyn)

- The action moves towards the General Council.
- **The "God's Man" (Bozhiy Cholovik):** A blind kobzar who represents the spiritual conscience of the nation. He refuses political participation, seeking only divine truth and healing.
- **Tensions:** Encounters with the "mob" (chern) who support Briukhovetskyi's populist promises of "equality" (robbing the rich).

### 5. The Black Council (Chorna Rada) near Nizhyn (June 1663)

- **The Event:** A "Black Council" means commoners (chern) were allowed to vote, not just rank-and-fill Cossacks.
- **The Outcome:** **Ivan Briukhovetskyi** wins by demagoguery, promising equality and wealth to the masses. The crowd is drunk and manipulated.
- **Yakym Somko:** Represents the pro-state, aristocratic, educated orientation. He loses because he is too distant from the common people and underestimated the populism.
- **Aftermath:** The "equality" turns out to be a lie; the rabble is dispersed, and the new starshyna takes power.

### 6. Tragedy and Resolution

- **Execution:** Somko and Vasiuta are executed.
- **Kyrylo Tur's offer:** Tur offers to take Somko's place in prison/death, but Somko refuses, accepting his fate as a martyr for Ukraine.
- **Ending:** Shram eventually dies (fades away or killed in struggle). Petro marries Lesya and they live a quiet family life, surviving the turmoil (symbol of national continuity).

## Characters

- **Yakym Somko:** Idealized hetman, intelligent, focused on state-building and unity. Represents the "European" path.
- **Ivan Briukhovetskyi:** Antagonist. Demagogue, populist, adventurous. Represents the destructive, anarchic side and reliance on Moscow (he seeks the Tsar's support).
- **Pavlo Teteria:** Mentioned as the Right-Bank hetman, pro-Polish.
- **Colonel Shram:** Veteran, patriot, seeks unity. Modeled on historical Popovych.
- **Petro Shramenko:** Romantic lead, ideal Cossack youth.
- **Mykhailo Cherevan:** The "Khutir" philosophy — private life, wealth, indifference to high politics.
- **Kyrylo Tur:** The chaotic but heroic energy of the Zaporozhian Sich.
- **Bozhiy Cholovik:** The moral compass, distinct from political chaos.

## Themes

- **State-building vs Anarchy:** The central conflict of the Ruin.
- **Role of the Elite:** Failure of the elite to communicate with the people.
- **Populism:** The danger of empty promises and mob rule.
- **Historical Memory:** Kulish creates a myth of the Cossack past to critique his contemporary 19th-century reality.

## Quotes (to be found/verified in text)

- About Ukraine's division.
- Somko's resignation to death.
- Bozhiy Cholovik's songs/philosophy.

## Engagement Hooks

- **[!myth-buster]**: The "Black Council" wasn't "democratic" in the modern sense; it was a manipulation of the mob.
- **[!history-bite]**: Real historical figures (Somko, Briukhovetskyi) vs fictional ones (Shram, Tur).
- **[!reflection]**: How populism in 1663 parallels modern politics.
- **[!cultural]**: The symbol of the "Khutir" (Cherevan) in Ukrainian culture — escapism or fortress?
