# LIT Modules - Reference Archive

This folder contains the original LIT modules (LIT-001 through LIT-006) created before the standardized template system.

## Purpose

These modules serve as **research reference material** for creating new LIT modules that follow the standardized template (`docs/l2-uk-en/templates/lit-module-template.md`).

## What to Use Them For

1. **Historical Facts & Analysis**: Deep research on Ukrainian literature history
2. **Vocabulary Lists**: Pre-compiled literary and historical terms
3. **Essay Topics**: Analytical questions and model answers
4. **Engagement Box Ideas**: Interesting facts and cultural insights
5. **Reading Recommendations**: Primary sources and scholarly articles

## Why Archived

The original modules, while high quality, had structural inconsistencies. To ensure 100% template compliance across all 30 LIT modules, we decided to:
- Archive these originals as reference
- Create fresh modules using the standardized template
- Maintain consistency across the entire LIT track

## Status

- **Original modules**: 6 (LIT-001 to LIT-006)
- **New modules needed**: 30 (LIT-001 to LIT-030)
- **Template**: `docs/l2-uk-en/templates/lit-module-template.md`
