## 2. Qualitative Review

- **Content Accuracy**: Strong historical context ("Ruin to Renaissance"). The analysis of "Aeneid" as a political manifesto is compelling and grounded in modern historiography (Hrytsak, Yefremov).
- **Pedagogy**: Activities promote deep engagement. The essay prompts require synthesis of biography and textual analysis.
- **Tone**: Appropriate academic yet engaging tone. The "Myth Buster" sections effectively counter imperial narratives.
- **Language**: Excellent use of terminologies (travesty, burlesque, genius loci).
