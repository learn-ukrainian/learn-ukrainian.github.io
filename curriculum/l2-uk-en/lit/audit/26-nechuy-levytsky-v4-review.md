| Category              | Score | Notes                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concept Deep Dive** | 10    | Detailed analysis of "Visual Style" and "Realism Manifesto". Goes beyond biography to literary theory.                     |
| **Linguistic Depth**  | 10    | Excellent analysis of visual vocabulary (sfuamato techniques) and dialect issues (Alphabet War).                           |
| **Engagement**        | 10    | High density of callouts (`[!myth-buster]`, `[!history-bite]`, `[!quote]`). Narrative flow is compelling.                  |
| **Decolonization**    | 10    | Strong focus on his resistance to Russification and "Empire of Spirit". Clear distinction from Russian "little man" trope. |
| **Formatting**        | 10    | Clean structure, correct headers, proper use of bolding and lists.                                                         |
| **Activities**        | 10    | Diverse types (Essay, Comparative, Analysis). Prompts are thought-provoking.                                               |

**Total Score:** 60/60

## 2. Qualitative Analysis

### Strengths

- **Visual Analysis:** The section "Артист Зору" provides a unique, almost art-historical perspective on his writing style, linking it to folk art (kylym).
- **History Bite:** The inclusion of the "Alphabet War" context adds necessary linguistic depth and explains his "conservatism" not as senility but as principle.
- **Psychological Portrait:** The "Hermit of Kyiv" section humanizes the classic, showing his loneliness as the price for his art.

### Weaknesses
