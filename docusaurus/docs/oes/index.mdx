## What is this track?

The **OES (Old East Slavic)** track is a specialized linguistic seminar exploring the language of Kyivan Rus' from the 10th to 13th centuries. This isn't just historical grammar — it's linguistic archaeology that reveals how modern Ukrainian evolved from its medieval ancestor.

## Why study Old East Slavic?

:::tip Decolonization through linguistics
Understanding Old East Slavic allows us to trace Ukrainian's direct lineage from Kyivan Rus'. The unique features of modern Ukrainian — the vocative case, dative endings in -ові/-еві, specific phonetic patterns — were already present in Kyiv a thousand years ago.
