In previous modules, you learned about the instrumental case: with the preposition **з** for accompaniment and without a preposition for transport and tools. Now it's time to discover another important use of the instrumental case — with the verbs **бути** (to be), **стати** (to become), and **працювати** (to work as)!

When you want to say "He is a doctor," "She became a teacher," or "I work as a programmer," Ukrainian uses the instrumental case. This is one of the most practical uses of the instrumental — talking about what people are and what they do!

**Why is this important?** Talking about professions is a fundamental skill in any language. By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe your job, discuss career changes, and ask others about their work — all using proper Ukrainian grammar.

# Presentation

## Бути + Instrumental: Being Something

In Ukrainian, the present tense of "to be" is usually zero — we don't use a verb: Він лікар. (He is a doctor.) But in the **past** and **future** tenses, we use **бути** + **Instrumental**:

| Tense | Pattern | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Present | Він лікар. | He is a doctor. (no verb, nominative) |
| Past | Він **був лікарем**. | He was a doctor. (бути + instrumental) |
| Future | Він **буде лікарем**. | He will be a doctor. (бути + instrumental) |

### Past Tense: був/була/було/були + Instrumental

When talking about what someone WAS in the past, you use the past tense of "бути" followed by the instrumental case. The past tense agrees in gender with the subject: **він був** (masculine), **вона була** (feminine), **воно було** (neuter), **вони були** (plural).

Він був студентом. (He was a student.)
Вона була вчителькою. (She was a teacher.)
Ми були друзями. (We were friends.)

Notice how the profession changes to instrumental: студент → студентом, вчителька → вчителькою.

### Future Tense: буде/будуть + Instrumental

For the future tense, use **буде** for singular subjects or **будуть** for plural subjects, followed by the instrumental case. This is how you express what someone WILL BE:

Він буде лікарем. (He will be a doctor.)
Вона буде журналісткою. (She will be a journalist.)
Вони будуть інженерами. (They will be engineers.)

The pattern is consistent: бути in past or future + noun in instrumental case.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> The present tense "zero copula" (no verb "to be") is a distinctive feature of Ukrainian and many Slavic languages. Russians use "это" for "this is," but Ukrainians simply say "Це." When Ukrainians speak English, they sometimes forget "is" because their brain doesn't expect a copula in present tense!

## Стати + Instrumental: Becoming Something

The verb **стати** (to become) is one of the most important verbs in Ukrainian for talking about changes in profession or state. Unlike бути, which uses instrumental only in past and future, стати ALWAYS takes the instrumental case, in all tenses:

Вона стала вчителькою. (She became a teacher.)
Він став лікарем. (He became a doctor.)
Ми стали друзями. (We became friends.)

This verb is perfective (completed action), so it's typically used in past and future. The imperfective counterpart is ставати (to be becoming).

### Conjugation of стати (perfective, past + future)

| Past | Future |
|------|--------|
| я став / стала | я стану |
| ти став / стала | ти станеш |
| він став | він стане |
| вона стала | вона стане |
| ми стали | ми станемо |
| ви стали | ви станете |
| вони стали | вони стануть |

Вона хоче стати лікаркою. (She wants to become a doctor.)
Він мріє стати письменником. (He dreams of becoming a writer.)
Коли ти станеш інженером? (When will you become an engineer?)

> 📜 **History Bite**
>
> Many famous Ukrainians changed professions dramatically: Тарас Шевченко **був кріпаком** (was a serf), але **став великим поетом** (became a great poet). Леся Українка хотіла стати музикою, але стала геніальною письменницею. Their stories of becoming are told in the instrumental case!

## Працювати + Instrumental: Working As

The verb **працювати** (to work) is used with the instrumental case to express what profession someone works as. This is different from English, where we use "as" + profession. In Ukrainian, no preposition is needed — just put the profession in instrumental:

Я працюю програмістом. (I work as a programmer.)
Вона працює журналісткою. (She works as a journalist.)
Він працює водієм. (He works as a driver.)

The question word for "as what" is **ким?** — the instrumental form of **хто** (who).

Note that you can also use **ким?** (as whom?) — this is the instrumental of **хто**:

— Ким ти працюєш? (What do you work as?)
— Я працюю вчителем. (I work as a teacher.)

### Common Profession Verbs with Instrumental

Here are the most common verbs that take the instrumental case when followed by a profession or role. Learning these patterns will help you talk about careers fluently:

| Verb | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| бути (past/future) | to be | Він був студентом. |
| стати | to become | Вона стала лікаркою. |
| працювати | to work as | Я працюю інженером. |
| служити | to serve as | Він служить солдатом. |
| залишатися | to remain | Вона залишається директоркою. |

Note that all these verbs follow the same pattern: verb + profession in instrumental case.

# Cultural Insight

## Ukrainian Professions: Gender Forms

One of the distinctive features of Ukrainian is that it has separate feminine forms for most professions. While English uses "doctor" for both men and women, Ukrainian distinguishes: **лікар** for a male doctor and **лікарка** for a female doctor.

This is not a modern invention — Ukrainian has always had productive suffixes like -ка, -иця, and -иня that form feminine nouns from masculine ones. Using the correct gender form is considered grammatically proper and respectful.

The main suffixes for feminine professions are:
- **-ка**: лікар → лікарка, інженер → інженерка
- **-иця**: письменник → письменниця

Here is a table of common professions with their masculine and feminine forms:

| Masculine | Feminine | English |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| лікар | лікарка | doctor |
| вчитель | вчителька | teacher |
| журналіст | журналістка | journalist |
| інженер | інженерка | engineer |
| програміст | програмістка | programmer |
| юрист | юристка | lawyer |
| актор | акторка | actor |
| письменник | письменниця | writer |

When talking about a woman's profession, use the feminine form in both nominative and instrumental:

Вона працює лікаркою. (She works as a doctor.)
Maria стала письменницею. (Maria became a writer.)

> 🔍 **Myth Buster**
>
> Some people claim feminine profession forms like "лікарка" or "інженерка" are "new" or "artificial." This is false! Ukrainian has always had productive feminine suffixes. What IS new is their official recognition — the Ukrainian language was suppressed for centuries, so codification of natural forms was delayed. Using лікарка instead of лікар for a woman is grammatically correct and culturally authentic!

## Famous Ukrainian Professionals

Ukraine has produced many outstanding professionals who changed the world. Here are some famous Ukrainians and their professions, demonstrating the instrumental case in action:

| Name | Profession and Achievement |
|------|------------|
| Сергій Корольов | He **was an engineer** (був інженером) who created the Soviet space program. |
| Леся Українка | She **became a writer** (стала письменницею) and poet. |
| Соломія Крушельницька | She **was an opera singer** (була співачкою) of world renown. |
| Ігор Сікорський | He **worked as an engineer** (працював інженером) and invented the helicopter. |

Notice how each profession appears in the instrumental case after the verbs був, стала, була, and працював.

> 🌍 **Real World**
>
> In modern Ukraine, IT professionals (програмісти) are one of the largest professional communities. Many Ukrainians say: "Я працюю програмістом" or "Моя мрія — стати програмістом." The tech sector uses both masculine and feminine forms actively: програміст / програмістка.

:::tip
Common Mistakes
English speakers often try to use "є" (is) in present tense: "Він є лікар." While this is understood, native Ukrainian simply says "Він лікар." The verb "to be" is invisible in present tense — it appears only in past (був) and future (буде).
:::


:::tip
Pattern Discovery
Notice that **стати** always takes instrumental, regardless of tense. Whether you say "Він став лікарем" (past), "Він стане лікарем" (future), or "Він хоче стати лікарем" (infinitive), the profession is always in instrumental!

# Practice

## Present vs. Past/Future

This is the key distinction you need to master: in present tense, Ukrainian doesn't use any verb for "to be" with professions. You simply state the subject and profession in nominative case. But in past and future tenses, you use бути followed by the profession in instrumental case.

Remember: Present tense = no verb, Nominative. Past/Future = бути, Instrumental. This is a fundamental pattern in Ukrainian that differs from English where "is" appears in all tenses.

Study this table carefully to see the pattern across all three tenses:

| Present (Nominative) | Past (Instrumental) | Future (Instrumental) |
|---------|------|--------|
| Він лікар. | Він **був лікарем**. | Він **буде лікарем**. |
| Вона студентка. | Вона **була студенткою**. | Вона **буде студенткою**. |
| Ми друзі. | Ми **були друзями**. | Ми **будемо друзями**. |

## Form the Instrumental of Professions

Here is a reference table showing how common professions change from nominative to instrumental case. Notice that masculine nouns typically add -ом or -ем, while feminine nouns add -ою:

| Nominative | Instrumental | Gender |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| лікар | лікарем | masc |
| вчитель | вчителем | masc |
| інженер | інженером | masc |
| програміст | програмістом | masc |
| журналіст | журналістом | masc |
| вчителька | вчителькою | fem |
| лікарка | лікаркою | fem |

## 📋 Summary

In this module, you learned how to talk about professions using three key verbs that take the instrumental case: бути (to be), стати (to become), and працювати (to work as). Here's a recap of the key patterns you mastered:

**Key Pattern 1: Бути + Instrumental** for past and future tenses

In present tense, Ukrainian doesn't use a verb for "to be" with professions. But in past and future, you use бути followed by the instrumental case:
- Він **був студентом**. (He was a student.)
- Вона **буде лікаркою**. (She will be a doctor.)
- Present tense: no бути, use nominative (Він студент.)

**Key Pattern 2: Стати + Instrumental** for becoming

The verb стати always takes instrumental, regardless of tense:
- Вона **стала вчителькою**. (She became a teacher.)
- Він **хоче стати програмістом**. (He wants to become a programmer.)

**Key Pattern 3: Працювати + Instrumental** for working as

No preposition is needed — just verb + profession in instrumental:
- Я **працюю інженером**. (I work as an engineer.)
- Ким ти працюєш? (What do you work as?)

**Gender Forms**: Remember that Ukrainian has separate masculine and feminine forms for most professions: лікар/лікарка, вчитель/вчителька, програміст/програмістка. Use the correct form based on the person's gender.

Now you can talk about your profession with confidence! 👨‍⚕️👩‍🏫💻
