# ✅ A2 - Елементарний

**Завершено**

## Building the Foundation

A2 transforms you from a tourist into someone who can truly communicate in Ukrainian. This level covers all 7 grammatical cases, introduces verbal aspect, and builds practical conversation skills for real-world situations.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Complete case system — Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Dative, Instrumental, Locative, Vocative
- Verbal aspect basics — Perfective vs. Imperfective
- Verb conjugation patterns across all tenses
- Practical scenarios — doctors, pharmacies, hotels, scheduling, social situations

**Learning Philosophy:** Ukrainian cases aren't random — they follow logical patterns. We teach you to recognize and apply these patterns, making what seems complex surprisingly systematic.
