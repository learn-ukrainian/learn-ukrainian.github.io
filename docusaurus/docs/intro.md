# Welcome to Curricula Opus

**A Theory-First Ukrainian Language Learning Platform**

---

## What is Curricula Opus?

Curricula Opus provides a complete **A1 to C2 pathway** for learning Ukrainian as a second language. We believe in deep understanding—grammar, culture, and history alongside practical application.

## Our Approach

### Theory-First Learning
Unlike apps that focus only on memorization, we give you the **why** behind the language. Understanding grammar patterns makes you a better learner.

### Cultural Immersion
Ukrainian isn't just words—it's folklore, literature, music, and centuries of history. Our curriculum includes authentic materials and cultural context.

### Interactive Practice
Every lesson includes interactive activities: quizzes, matching exercises, fill-in-the-blank, and more.
