## Діагностика

Read the following text carefully. In each sentence, two actions happen at the same time. One action is the "main" action, and the other is the "background" action happening simultaneously.

> Оленка сиділа біля вікна, слухаючи музику. Дивлячись на захід сонця, вона думала про своє життя. Не кажучи ні слова, вона встала і пішла на кухню. Готуючи вечерю, вона продовжувала слухати свою улюблену пісню.

**Questions:**
1. What action was Olenka doing while sitting by the window?
2. What was she doing while watching the sunset?
3. Did she say anything when she got up?
4. What was happening while she was cooking dinner?

> 💡 **Pattern Discovery**
> Notice the words ending in **-ючи** and **-ачи**: *слухаючи, дивлячись, кажучи, готуючи*. These are **adverbial participles** — they describe an action happening at the same time as the main verb.

## Аналіз

### What Are Adverbial Participles?

Adverbial participles (*дієприслівники*) are verb forms that describe HOW, WHEN, or WHY the main action happens. In Ukrainian, imperfective adverbial participles express **simultaneous actions** — two things happening at the same time.

**Compare:**

| Two Separate Sentences | One Combined Sentence |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Він читав книгу. Він пив каву. | **Читаючи книгу**, він пив каву. |
| *(He was reading a book. He was drinking coffee.)* | *(While reading a book, he was drinking coffee.)* |

> 🔗 **Language Link: English Equivalents**
> 
> Ukrainian imperfective adverbial participles translate to English in several ways:
> - **While + -ing:** *Читаючи* = While reading
> - **By + -ing:** *Працюючи наполегливо* = By working hard  
> - **-ing clause:** *Walking down the street, I met a friend.*
> 
> Unlike English, Ukrainian uses special verb forms specifically for this purpose — you cannot just add "ing" to any verb.

> 🎓 **Academic Note: Semantic Nuances**
> 
> Adverbial participles can express several semantic relationships between actions:
> 
> | Relationship | Example | Translation |
> |-------------|---------|-------------|
> | **Simultaneity** | Співаючи, вона працювала. | While singing, she worked. |
> | **Manner** | Він увійшов, посміхаючись. | He entered, smiling. |
> | **Cause** | Не знаючи правди, він помилився. | Not knowing the truth, he made a mistake. |
> | **Condition** | Працюючи більше, ти заробиш більше. | By working more, you'll earn more. |
> | **Concession** | Розуміючи ризики, він все одно погодився. | Despite understanding the risks, he agreed anyway. |
> 
> The context determines which meaning applies. This versatility makes participles powerful tools for nuanced expression.

---

### Formation Rules

Imperfective adverbial participles are formed from the **present tense stem** of imperfective verbs:

**Formula:** Present stem + **-ючи** (after vowel) OR **-ачи** (after consonant with 2nd conjugation)

| Infinitive | 3rd Plural | Stem | Participle | Meaning |
|------------|-----------|------|------------|---------|
| читати | чита**ють** | чита- | чита**ючи** | while reading |
| писати | пиш**уть** | пиш- | пиш**учи** | while writing |
| говорити | говор**ять** | говор- | говор**ячи** | while speaking |
| бігти | біж**ать** | біж- | біж**ачи** | while running |
| сидіти | сид**ять** | сид- | сид**ячи** | while sitting |
| лежати | леж**ать** | леж- | леж**ачи** | while lying |

:::tip[Notice the Pattern]
- **1st Conjugation** (they end in -ють/-уть): use **-ючи/-учи**
- **2nd Conjugation** (they end in -ять/-ать): use **-ячи/-ачи**
:::


---

### Special Cases: Reflexive Verbs

Reflexive verbs keep their **-ся/-сь** suffix:

| Infinitive | Participle | Meaning |
|------------|------------|---------|
| одягатися | одяга**ючись** | while getting dressed |
| повертатися | поверта**ючись** | while returning |
| сміятися | сміючись | while laughing |
| дивитися | дивлячись | while watching/looking |

> ⚠️ **Warning: Don't Confuse**
> - **дивитися** (reflexive: to look AT something) → дивл**ячись**
> - **дивувати** (to amaze someone) → дивуючи

---

### Subject Agreement Rule

**Critical:** The adverbial participle and the main verb must have the **same subject**.

| ✅ CORRECT | ❌ INCORRECT |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Читаючи** книгу, **він** заснув. | ~~Читаючи книгу, м**ені** стало нудно.~~ |
| *(While reading the book, HE fell asleep.)* | *(While reading the book, it became boring TO ME.)* |

> 🔗 **Language Link: The Dangling Participle Problem**
> 
> This error — a participle with the wrong subject — is called a "dangling participle" in English grammar too. In Ukrainian, it sounds equally awkward and ungrammatical.
> 
> **Fix the incorrect example:**
> - Коли я читав книгу, мені стало нудно. *(When I was reading the book, I got bored.)*

---

### Stress Patterns in Adverbial Participles

Stress in Ukrainian adverbial participles typically follows the present tense stem:

| Infinitive | 3rd Plural (stress) | Participle (same stress) |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| говори́ти | говоря́ть | говоря́чи |
| чита́ти | чита́ють | чита́ючи |
| писа́ти | пи́шуть | пи́шучи |
| сидíти | сидя́ть | сидя́чи |
| бíгти | бíжать | бíжачи |

> 💡 **Pronunciation Tip**
> 
> Pay special attention to verbs where the stress shifts in conjugation. The participle follows the 3rd person plural pattern, not the infinitive. For example: писа́ти → пи́шуть → пи́шучи (stress shifts to the first syllable).

### High-Frequency Verb-Participle Pairs

Memorize these common pairs used in everyday communication:

| Infinitive | Participle | Common Context |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| знати | знаючи | Знаючи це, він вирішив... (Knowing this, he decided...) |
| мати | маючи | Маючи час, я б зробив... (Having time, I would do...) |
| бачити | бачачи | Бачачи проблему, ми діяли. (Seeing the problem, we acted.) |

| Context | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Two parallel actions** | Слухаючи музику, вона працювала. *(While listening to music, she worked.)* |
| **Background action** | Йдучи додому, я зустрів друга. *(Walking home, I met a friend.)* |
| **Manner (HOW)** | Він говорив, посміхаючись. *(He spoke, smiling.)* |
| **Condition** | Працюючи наполегливо, ти досягнеш успіху. *(By working hard, you'll achieve success.)* |

> 🎬 **Cinema Corner: Classic Ukrainian Film Phrases**
> 
> In Dovzhenko's films, adverbial participles create a poetic, flowing rhythm:
> - *Йдучи степом, козаки співали пісню...* (Walking through the steppe, the Cossacks sang a song...)
> 
> This construction remains powerful in modern Ukrainian literature and journalism.

> 🌍 **Real World: Modern Usage**
> 
> Adverbial participles are common in formal and written Ukrainian:
> - News: *Коментуючи події, президент зазначив...* (Commenting on the events, the president noted...)
> - Business: *Аналізуючи дані, ми бачимо...* (Analyzing the data, we see...)
> - Literature: *Усміхаючись, вона простягнула руку.* (Smiling, she extended her hand.)

---

### Word Order

Adverbial participle phrases can come **before** or **after** the main clause:

| Position | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Before** (common) | **Читаючи статтю**, він робив нотатки. |
| **After** (common) | Він робив нотатки, **читаючи статтю**. |
| **In the middle** (less common) | Він, **читаючи статтю**, робив нотатки. |

All three mean: *While reading the article, he was taking notes.*

> 📚 **Historical Note: The Ems Decree of 1876**
> 
> The Ems Decree (*Емський указ*) banned Ukrainian-language publications, including grammar textbooks that taught these elegant constructions. For decades, Ukrainians were forbidden from learning the full beauty of their native grammar in schools. When you master adverbial participles, you are reclaiming a piece of Ukrainian linguistic heritage.

---

### Negation

To negate an adverbial participle, add **не** directly before it:

| Positive | Negative |
|----------|----------|
| Читаючи книгу... | **Не** читаючи книгу... |
| *(While reading the book...)* | *(Without reading the book... / Not reading the book...)* |

**Examples:**
- Не знаючи правди, він прийняв неправильне рішення. *(Not knowing the truth, he made the wrong decision.)*
- Не думаючи про наслідки, вона погодилася. *(Without thinking about the consequences, she agreed.)*

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

> ⚠️ **Mistake 1: Wrong Conjugation Pattern**
> 
> | ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct | 
> |----------|-----------|
> | сидіюючи | сид**ячи** |
> | бігіючи | біж**ачи** |
> 
> Remember: 2nd conjugation verbs (with -ять/-ать in 3rd plural) use **-ячи/-ачи**.

> ⚠️ **Mistake 2: Using Perfective Verbs**
> 
> | ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
> |----------|-----------|
> | прочитаючи | While reading = **читаючи** (impf) |
> | написаючи | While writing = **пишучи** (impf) |
> 
> For completed actions BEFORE the main verb, use perfective adverbial participles (next module!).

---

### Stylistic Register: When to Use Participles

Adverbial participles belong to a **higher stylistic register** in Ukrainian. Understanding when and where to use them makes your Ukrainian sound more sophisticated and natural.

| Register | Participle Usage | Example |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Formal/Academic** | Very common | Аналізуючи дані експерименту, дослідники дійшли висновку... |
| **Journalistic** | Common | Коментуючи подію, міністр заявив... |
| **Literary** | Common | Усміхаючись з-під вусів, дід почав розповідь... |
| **Conversational** | Less common | Йдучи додому, зустрів Петра. |
| **Colloquial** | Rare | Preferred: Коли йшов додому... |

> 🌍 **Real World Application**
> 
> When writing formal emails, academic papers, or official documents in Ukrainian, adverbial participles demonstrate language mastery. Native speakers often associate their proper use with education and eloquence. Compare:
> 
> **Formal (with participle):** *Дякуючи за ваш лист, хочу повідомити...*
> **Informal (without):** *Дякую за ваш лист. Хочу повідомити...*

### Etymology and Historical Context

The adverbial participle (*дієприслівник*) literally means "verb-adverb" — a form that carries verbal meaning while functioning adverbially. This grammatical structure has ancient Proto-Slavic roots and represents one of the most elegant features of Ukrainian grammar.

> 🏛️ **Myth Buster: Ukrainian Grammar Complexity**
> 
> **Russian propaganda claim:** "Ukrainian grammar is just simplified Russian."
> **Truth:** Ukrainian preserved and developed unique grammatical structures, including rich adverbial participle forms. During the Ems Decree period (1876-1905), teaching these sophisticated structures in Ukrainian was banned. Today, mastering them represents reclaiming linguistic heritage that imperial policies tried to suppress.

### Comparison with Russian and Polish

Ukrainian adverbial participles share features with other Slavic languages but have distinct characteristics:

| Feature | Ukrainian | Russian | Polish |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| Impf. ending | -ючи/-ачи | -я/-а | -ąc |
| Reflexive marker | -сь (дивлячись) | -сь (смотрясь) | się (patrząc się) |
| Usage frequency | High in formal | High in formal | Moderate |
| Stylistic value | Elegant, literary | Neutral-formal | Formal |

> 💡 **Key Insight**
> 
> Ukrainian adverbial participles often carry more stylistic weight than their Russian counterparts. A text with well-placed participles signals educated, even literary Ukrainian — something particularly valued given the historical suppression of formal Ukrainian language education.

## 📋 Підсумок

In this module, you learned to form and use **imperfective adverbial participles** — one of the elegant structures that make Ukrainian expressive and sophisticated. These forms allow you to express simultaneous actions efficiently, moving beyond simple compound sentences.

**Remember:**
- 1st conjugation verbs → **-ючи/-учи** (читаючи, пишучи)
- 2nd conjugation verbs → **-ячи/-ачи** (сидячи, говорячи)
- Same subject rule: participle and main verb share one subject
- Negation: не + participle (не знаючи)

In the next module, you'll learn **perfective adverbial participles** — used for actions completed BEFORE the main verb (прочитавши = having read).
