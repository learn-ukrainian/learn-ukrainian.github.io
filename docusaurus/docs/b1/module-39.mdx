## Діагностика

Read the following passage. Notice how the objects are described — not by what they do, but by what was done TO them.

> На столі лежала **написана** книга, **відкрита** на останній сторінці. Поруч стояла **наповнена** чашка кави. На стіні висіла **намальована** картина — портрет **забутого** героя. Все в кімнаті здавалося **покинутим**, **залишеним** давно.

**Questions:**
1. What was done to the book? (It was...)
2. What was done to the cup? (It was...)
3. What was done to the painting? (It was...)
4. What endings do you notice on these words?

> 💡 **Pattern Discovery**
> The words ending in **-ана, -ена, -ита, -им** (написана, відкрита, намальована, забутого) are **passive participles**. They describe what has been done TO something.

## Аналіз

### Active vs. Passive: What's the Difference?

| Active Participle | Passive Participle |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Describes WHO does | Describes WHAT is done |
| The **reading** student | The **read** book |
| Студент, **який читає** | **Прочитана** книга |

**Passive participles answer:** What was done to this? What state is it in as a result?

> 🔗 **Language Link: English Comparison**
> 
> English has the same concept:
> - **Written** report = a report that was written
> - **Opened** door = a door that was opened
> - **Broken** window = a window that was broken
> 
> Ukrainian passive participles work the same way, but with more complex agreement rules.

---

### Formation Rules

Passive participles are formed from **perfective verbs** using these patterns:

**Main Pattern: Stem + -ений/-аний/-яний or -ний/-тий**

| Verb Ending | Participle Suffix | Examples |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| -ати/-яти | -аний/-яний | написати → написаний, зробляти → зроблений |
| -ити/-їти | -ений/-єний | зробити → зроблений, побудувати → побудований |
| -ути/-юти | -утий/-ютий | взути → взутий |
| -нути | -нутий | кинути → кинутий, повернути → повернутий |
| -ти | -тий | відкрити → відкритий, закрити → закритий |

**The Most Common Patterns:**

| Infinitive | Participle | Meaning |
|------------|------------|---------|
| написати | напис**аний** | written |
| прочитати | прочит**аний** | read |
| зробити | зробл**ений** | done, made |
| побудувати | побудов**аний** | built |
| відкрити | відкри**тий** | opened |
| закрити | закри**тий** | closed |
| взяти | взя**тий** | taken |
| сказати | сказ**аний** | said |

:::tip[Key Observation]
- Most verbs in **-ати** → **-аний** (написати → написаний)
- Most verbs in **-ити** → **-ений** (зробити → зроблений)
- Stem consonant changes may occur: д→дж, т→ч, с→ш
:::

### Consonant Changes (Stem Alternations)

Some verbs have consonant changes in the passive participle:

| Infinitive | Change | Participle | Meaning |
|------------|--------|------------|---------|
| побудувати | — | побудований | built |
| поставити | в→вл | поставлений | placed |
| купити | п→пл | куплений | bought |
| зробити | б→бл | зроблений | made |
| запросити | с→ш | запрошений | invited |
| вирішити | ш→ш | вирішений | decided, solved |
| отримати | — | отриманий | received |
| надіслати | — | надісланий | sent |

> 📚 **Historical Note**
> 
> These consonant alternations (called **палаталізація**) are ancient features of Slavic languages, dating back over 1,000 years. They appear in many Ukrainian word forms and reflect the language's deep history.

---

### Agreement Rules

**Passive participles agree with the noun they describe in:**
- Gender (masculine, feminine, neuter)
- Number (singular, plural)
- Case (all 7 cases)

| Gender | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Masculine | написан**ий** | написан**і** |
| Feminine | написан**а** | написан**і** |
| Neuter | написан**е** | написан**і** |

**Case examples (masculine):**

| Case | Ending | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Nominative | -ий | написаний лист |
| Genitive | -ого | написаного листа |
| Dative | -ому | написаному листу |
| Accusative | -ий/-ого | написаний лист / написаного друга |
| Instrumental | -им | написаним листом |
| Locative | -ому/-ім | у написаному листі |
| Vocative | -ий | написаний листе! |

> 🌍 **Real World Usage**
> 
> You'll hear and see passive participles constantly:
> - *Ця книга написана українською.* (This book is written in Ukrainian.)
> - *Вікно закрите.* (The window is closed.)
> - *Завдання виконане.* (The task is completed.)
> - *Ресторан відкритий.* (The restaurant is open.)

## Поглиблення

### Using Passive Participles

**1. As Adjectives (describing nouns):**
- **Написана** книга лежала на столі. *(The written book lay on the table.)*
- Я прочитав **цікаву написану** історію. *(I read an interesting written story.)*

**2. As Predicates (with бути or без):**
- Книга **написана**. *(The book is written.)*
- Двері **були закриті**. *(The doors were closed.)*
- Завдання **буде виконане**. *(The task will be completed.)*

**3. With Agent (by whom):**
- Книга написана **письменником**. *(The book was written by a writer.)*
- Картина намальована **художником**. *(The painting was painted by an artist.)*
- Лист надісланий **директором**. *(The letter was sent by the director.)*

> 🔗 **Language Link: The "by" Construction**
> 
> In English, the agent in passive voice uses "by" (by the writer).
> In Ukrainian, the agent uses the **Instrumental case** without a preposition:
> - написана **письменником** = written by a writer
> - зроблений **майстром** = made by a craftsman

## Metaphorical Participles: The Poetic Layer

Passive participles aren't just for physical objects; they are the backbone of Ukrainian emotional and metaphorical expression.

**Common Metaphors:**
- **Розбите серце:** A broken heart.
- **Втрачений час:** Lost time.
- **Забута мрія:** A forgotten dream.
- **Відкрита душа:** An open soul (sincere person).
- **Закритий характер:** A closed character (introverted/secretive).

> 🥀 **Poetic Example:**
> «О, **втрачений** раю, ти снишся мені...» (Oh, lost paradise, I dream of you...)
> Participles carry a sense of finality and result that simple adjectives often lack. «Сумний» (sad) is a state; «Засмучений» (saddened) implies something *made* you sad.

## Historical Context: The Soviet Passive

In Soviet times, the passive voice was often weaponized in news to hide responsibility.
*"Помилки були зроблені..."* (Mistakes were made...)
By whom? The government? The party? The passive voice hid the culprit.

Contrast this with the Ukrainian spirit of **Agency**. When Vasyl Stus wrote poetry in the Gulag, he used powerful active verbs or defiant passive participles.
*"Я розп'ятий на хресті..."* (I am crucified on the cross...).
Here, the passive participle **розп'ятий** doesn't hide the agent; it emphasizes the suffering victim.

> 🔦 **Decolonization Note**
> Be careful with the passive voice. Use it to emphasize the *result* (e.g., "The bridge is built"), not to hide the *person responsible* for a bad action.

### Folklore Wisdom

Ukrainian folklore uses passive participles to describe universal truths.
*"Що написано пером, того не вивезеш волом."*
(What is written with a pen, you cannot haul away with an ox).
Meaning: Once something is documented (written), it is permanent and powerful.

Note the form **написано**. This is the **short form** (M40 topic), but it comes from our full participle **написаний**.
Folklore loves these forms because they sound like ancient laws.

### Idioms with Participles

- **Підвішений язик** (A suspended tongue) = The gift of gab (speaks well).
  - *У нього язик добре підвішений.*
- **Замкнене коло** (A closed circle) = A vicious circle.
  - *Це просто якесь замкнене коло.*
- **Сказаного не повернеш** (What is said cannot be returned).
  - Use this when someone regrets their words.

## The Culinary Kitchen: Participles at Work

Ukrainian cuisine loves participles because cooking is all about *doing things to ingredients*.

- **Смажений** (Fried) — from смажити.
- **Варений** (Boiled) — from варити.
- **Печений** (Baked) — from пекти.
- **Солоний** (Salted) — from солити.
- **Маринований** (Marinated) — from маринувати.

> 🍲 **Menu Decode:**
> *Картопля **печена** з **маринованими** грибами.* (Baked potato with marinated mushrooms.)
> Technically, these function almost like adjectives, but grammatically they are derived from verbs.

## Deeper Look: The Passive Worldview

Why do we use the passive voice? Is it just to be complicated?
No. It shifts the focus.

### 1. Object Focus
- **Active:** *Ivan built this house.* (Focus on Ivan).
- **Passive:** *This house was built by Ivan.* (Focus on House).

In Ukrainian culture, respecting the object or the result is often more important than emphasizing the doer.
*Задача вирішена.* (The problem is solved). Who solved it? Doesn't matter. The important thing is the **result**.

### 2. The "Divine" Passive
In religious and poetic texts, the passive voice implies an external, higher force.
*Доля вирішена.* (The fate is decided). By whom? By God, by destiny.
Using the passive participle removes the human agent and elevates the event to something unchanging and absolute.

## Stylistic Nuance: Formal vs. Personal

### When to use Passive Participles?
- **Scientific Papers:** *Дослідження проведено...* (Research conducted...)
- **News Reports:** *Закон прийнятий...* (Law adopted...)
- **Formal Invitations:** *Ви запрошені...* (You are invited...)

### When NOT to use them?
In casual conversation, overuse of passive participles can sound cold or distant.
- **Cold:** *Вечеря приготовлена мною.* (Dinner is prepared by me).
- **Warm:** *Я приготувала вечерю.* (I prepared dinner).

Use passive forms when you want to sound **objective, professional, or poetic**. Use active verbs for **warmth and agency**.

## 📋 Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Passive participles** describe what was done TO something (written, opened, built).

2. **Formation:**
   - **-ати/-яти** verbs → **-аний/-яний** (написати → написаний)
   - **-ити** verbs → **-ений** (зробити → зроблений)
   - **-ти** (consonant stem) → **-тий** (відкрити → відкритий)

3. **Agreement:** Participles agree with nouns in gender, number, and case.

4. **Agent:** Use Instrumental case (without preposition) for "by whom":
   - написаний **письменником** = written by a writer

5. These forms are extremely common in everyday Ukrainian!

## 📋 Підсумок

In this module, you mastered **full passive participles** (-ний/-тий) — the essential tool for describing states resulting from completed actions. These forms are everywhere in Ukrainian!

**Remember:**
- **Formation:** perfective verb + -аний/-ений/-тий (depending on verb type)
- **Agreement:** gender, number, and case with the noun
- **Agent:** Instrumental case (написана письменником)

In the next module, you'll learn the **short forms** (-но/-то) — impersonal passive constructions like "написано" (it was written).
