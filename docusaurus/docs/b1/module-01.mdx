> 🎯 **Why This Module Matters**
>
> You're at B1 now. From this point forward, you'll encounter grammar explanations written *in Ukrainian* — in textbooks, online resources, and conversations with native speakers. To understand these resources, you need to know what Ukrainians call the parts of speech, the cases, and other grammar concepts. This module gives you that vocabulary. By the end, you'll be able to read a Ukrainian grammar explanation and understand what it's talking about.

## Presentation

### The Challenge of Learning Grammar in a New Language

Think about how you learned grammar in school. Someone taught you terms like "noun," "verb," "adjective." Now imagine picking up a Ukrainian grammar book. You open it and see: *"Іменник стоїть у родовому відмінку після прийменника..."*

If you don't know that **іменник** means "noun," **родовий відмінок** means "genitive case," and **прийменник** means "preposition," you're lost. This module solves that problem.

Ukrainians have a saying: **«Хто мови не знає, той і граматики не розуміє.»** — "Who doesn't know the language, doesn't understand grammar either." The terms you'll learn here are the keys that unlock every Ukrainian grammar resource.

### Why Ukrainians Learn This Too

Every Ukrainian schoolchild learns these terms in school. When a Ukrainian teacher says "Поставте дієслово в минулому часі," students know they need to put the verb in past tense. These aren't foreign concepts — they're just new words for ideas you already understand.

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian grammar terminology comes largely from Church Slavonic and Latin traditions. The word **відмінок** literally means "change" or "variation" — because the word *changes* form depending on its role in the sentence. The word **дієслово** literally means "action-word" (діє + слово).

## The Parts of Speech: Частини мови

Ukrainian has ten parts of speech. At B1, you need to recognize all of them by their Ukrainian names. Understanding these terms is essential because from now on, you'll encounter grammar explanations written entirely in Ukrainian. Native speakers don't think about grammar using English terminology — they use their own rich system of terms that has developed over centuries.

The ten parts of speech divide into two main groups: самостійні частини мови (content words) and службові частини мови (function words). The content words carry independent meaning and can function as sentence elements on their own. The function words exist to connect, modify, and structure sentences — they cannot stand alone as sentence elements.

### Content Words (Самостійні частини мови)

These are the words that carry meaning:

| Термін | English | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **іменник** | noun | книга, стіл, Київ |
| **дієслово** | verb | читати, писати, бігти |
| **прикметник** | adjective | гарний, великий, синій |
| **прислівник** | adverb | швидко, добре, тут |
| **займенник** | pronoun | я, ти, він, вона |
| **числівник** | numeral | один, два, перший |

Let's see these in action. **Студентка читає цікаву книгу.** Here, **студентка** is the іменник (who's reading?), **читає** is the дієслово (what's she doing?), and **цікаву** is the прикметник (what kind of book?).

Or consider: **Він швидко біжить до зупинки.** The word **він** is a займенник replacing someone's name, **швидко** is a прислівник telling us how he runs, and **біжить** is the дієслово — the action itself.

> 🌍 **Real World: Grammar Discussions**
>
> When Ukrainians discuss language on forums or social media, they use these terms freely. You might see: "Тут треба вжити дієслово доконаного виду" (Here you need to use a perfective verb). Without knowing **дієслово** and **вид**, you'd miss the point entirely.

Notice how each Ukrainian term describes what the word category does. The іменник comes from "ім'я" — it names things. The прикметник comes from "прикмета" — it describes characteristics. The прислівник literally means "by the verb" — adverbs typically modify verbs. Understanding these etymologies helps you remember the terms.

### Function Words (Службові частини мови)

These words don't carry meaning on their own — they connect and modify. Think of them as the glue that holds sentences together. Without прийменники, you couldn't show relationships between objects. Without сполучники, you couldn't connect clauses. These words are essential for constructing complex sentences:

| Термін | English | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **прийменник** | preposition | в, на, до, з |
| **сполучник** | conjunction | і, але, бо, що |
| **частка** | particle | не, ні, хай, би |
| **вигук** | interjection | ой, ах, гей |

Watch how these work: **Книга лежить на столі.** The word **на** is a прийменник — it connects the book to the table and tells us where. **Я хочу піти, але не маю часу.** Here **але** is a сполучник joining two ideas. **Вона не прийде сьогодні.** The tiny word **не** is a частка — it flips the meaning from "she will come" to "she won't come."

And when you stub your toe? **Ой, як боляче!** That **ой** is a вигук — pure emotion, no grammar required.

### The Master Category

| Термін | English | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **частина мови** | part of speech | The category a word belongs to |

The частка is particularly interesting — it's a small word that adds nuance to sentences. The most common частка is "не", which negates verbs and adjectives. The word "частка" itself means "small part" — these are the smallest functional elements of speech. Other common частки include "хай" for imperatives, "би" for conditionals, and "ні" for emphatic negation.

## The Seven Cases: Сім відмінків

You've been using Ukrainian cases since A1. Now you'll learn their Ukrainian names. Ukrainian is a highly inflected language, meaning that word endings change based on grammatical function. These changes are organized into seven відмінків. When a Ukrainian grammar book tells you to put a noun in the родовий відмінок, you need to know exactly which ending patterns to apply.

Each case has a specific function and a specific set of question words that help you identify it. Memorizing the питання for each case is just as important as memorizing the case names themselves:

| Number | Українська назва | English | Question | Example |
|--------|-----------------|---------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **називний** | nominative | хто? що? | книга |
| 2 | **родовий** | genitive | кого? чого? | книги |
| 3 | **давальний** | dative | кому? чому? | книзі |
| 4 | **знахідний** | accusative | кого? що? | книгу |
| 5 | **орудний** | instrumental | ким? чим? | книгою |
| 6 | **місцевий** | locative | на кому? на чому? | на книзі |
| 7 | **кличний** | vocative | — | книго! |

Let's trace one noun through all seven cases. Take **сестра** — sister:

**Сестра прийшла.** (називний — who came?)
**Немає сестри.** (родовий — there's no whom?)
**Дав сестрі подарунок.** (давальний — gave to whom?)
**Бачу сестру.** (знахідний — I see whom?)
**Розмовляю з сестрою.** (орудний — talking with whom?)
**Думаю про сестру.** (місцевий after "про" — thinking about whom?)
**Сестро, допоможи!** (кличний — calling out to her)

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> The case names come from their functions:
> - **Називний** (from "називати" — to name) is for naming the subject
> - **Родовий** (from "рід" — origin/kind) shows origin or possession
> - **Давальний** (from "давати" — to give) marks the recipient
> - **Знахідний** (from "знаходити" — to find) marks the direct object
> - **Орудний** (from "орудувати" — to use as a tool) marks the instrument
> - **Місцевий** (from "місце" — place) marks location
> - **Кличний** (from "кликати" — to call) is for direct address

### The Master Term

| Термін | English | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **відмінок** | grammatical case | The category that shows a noun's role |

The mnemonic in Діалог 4 — "На Різдво Дід Загубив Орішки Між Ковбасками" — is a genuine Ukrainian school tradition. Students learn this phrase early on, and it stays with them for life. You'll find that native speakers can recite the cases in order without thinking, because this mnemonic made the sequence automatic.

## Basic Sentence Terms

To understand grammar explanations, you need words for sentence structure. These terms appear constantly in grammar textbooks, online resources, and language learning apps. When you read an explanation like "Дієслово змінюється за особами та числами" (The verb changes according to person and number), you need to know what особа and число mean.

The concept of рід is fundamental to Ukrainian grammar. Every noun has a gender — чоловічий, жіночий, or середній — and this gender determines how adjectives, pronouns, and past-tense verbs agree with the noun. The term число refers to whether something is однина or множина:

| Термін | English | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **слово** | word | "книга" — це слово |
| **речення** | sentence | Це коротке речення. |
| **рід** | gender | чоловічий, жіночий, середній |
| **число** | number | однина, множина |
| **особа** | person | перша, друга, третя |
| **закінчення** | ending | -а, -ою, -і |

See how these work together: **Новий студент прийшов.** vs. **Нова студентка прийшла.** The adjective **новий/нова** and the past tense verb **прийшов/прийшла** both change based on the рід of the noun.

For число: **Студент читає.** (однина — one student) vs. **Студенти читають.** (множина — multiple students). Both the noun ending and the verb ending change.

And особа? Watch: **Я читаю.** (перша особа — I), **Ти читаєш.** (друга особа — you), **Він читає.** (третя особа — he). The закінчення of the verb tells you who's doing the action.

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: Language Learning in Ukraine**
>
> In Ukrainian schools, grammar is taught rigorously. A typical exercise might say: "Визначте відмінок іменників у реченні" (Determine the case of the nouns in the sentence). Ukrainian students do this from around age 8. Now you're learning what they learned as children — but you're doing it faster because you already understand the concepts in English.

### Why Grammar Terminology Matters for Self-Study

When you study independently using Ukrainian resources, you'll encounter instructions like "Утворіть форму орудного відмінка" (Form the instrumental case). Without knowing that орудний means instrumental and відмінок means case, you can't complete the exercise. Similarly, online forums where Ukrainians discuss language learning use these terms constantly. If someone writes "Тут потрібен давальний" (Here you need dative), you need to know what давальний means.

Imagine you're watching a grammar video from Kyiv and the teacher says: **«Зверніть увагу на закінчення дієслова в третій особі.»** If you know the terms, you hear: "Pay attention to the verb ending in third person." If you don't, it's just noise.

Or you're reading a forum post from Львів: **«У цьому реченні підмет стоїть після присудка.»** Now you understand: "In this sentence, the subject comes after the predicate."

The good news is that once you learn these twenty-five terms, they unlock an entire world of Ukrainian-language learning resources. Grammar textbooks written for native speakers become accessible. YouTube explanations in Ukrainian make sense. Even the error messages in language learning apps that explain why your answer was wrong — those become comprehensible when you know the terminology.

## Practice

### Pattern Recognition

Look at these Ukrainian grammar instructions and identify what they're asking:

1. *"Поставте іменник у родовому відмінку."*
   - Put the **noun** in the **genitive case**.

2. *"Знайдіть усі дієслова в тексті."*
   - Find all the **verbs** in the text.

3. *"Визначте рід цих іменників."*
   - Determine the **gender** of these **nouns**.

4. *"Утворіть прислівник від прикметника."*
   - Form an **adverb** from the **adjective**.

### Reading Ukrainian Grammar


Here's a sample grammar explanation. Can you understand it?

> *Іменник "книга" — жіночого роду. У знахідному відмінку він має форму "книгу". Після прийменника "на" вживається місцевий відмінок: "на книзі".*

**Translation:** The noun "книга" is feminine gender. In the accusative case, it has the form "книгу". After the preposition "на", the locative case is used: "на книзі".

## Mini-Dialogues

### Діалог 1: На уроці

**Вчитель:** Скажіть, будь ласка, яка частина мови слово "швидко"?

**Студент:** Це прислівник.

**Вчитель:** Правильно! А від якого слова воно утворене?

**Студент:** Від прикметника "швидкий".

**Вчитель:** Молодець! А тепер знайдіть усі прислівники в цьому реченні.

---

### Діалог 2: Розмова друзів

**Оксана:** Я не розумію цю вправу. Тут написано "поставте у давальному відмінку".

**Марко:** Давальний — це третій відмінок. Питання "кому? чому?"

**Оксана:** А, зрозуміло! Тобто замість "книга" буде "книзі"?

**Марко:** Так, правильно. Я даю книгу — кому? — сестрі.

---

### Діалог 3: В університеті

**Професор:** Сьогодні ми поговоримо про дієслово.

**Студентка:** А що таке "дієслово"?

**Професор:** Дієслово — це частина мови, яка називає дію. Наприклад: читати, писати, думати.

**Студентка:** Тобто це те, що в англійській називається "verb"?

**Професор:** Саме так. А українське слово буквально означає "слово дії".

---

### Діалог 4: Готування до іспиту

**Ігор:** Ти вивчив усі відмінки?

**Тетяна:** Так, усі сім. Називний, родовий, давальний, знахідний, орудний, місцевий, кличний.

**Ігор:** А як запам'ятати порядок?

**Тетяна:** Є мнемоніка: "На Різдво Дід Загубив Орішки Між Ковбасками."

**Ігор:** О, класна ідея! Перші букви — Н, Р, Д, З, О, М, К!

> 💡 **Did You Know?**
>
> Ukrainian students use mnemonics to remember case order. "На Різдво Дід Загубив Орішки Між Ковбасками" (On Christmas, Grandpa Lost Nuts Among Sausages) is one popular version. The first letters match: Н-азивний, Р-одовий, Д-авальний, З-нахідний, О-рудний, М-ісцевий, К-личний.
