# Пасивні конструкції

Українська мова має три способи висловлення пасивного значення. (Ukrainian has three distinct ways to express passive meaning.) Кожен спосіб виконує різні комунікативні функції та використовується в різних стилях. (Each serves different communicative purposes and appears in different registers.) Опанування всіх трьох дає вам повний набір інструментів для опису дій без називання діяча. (Mastering all three gives you the full toolkit for describing actions without naming the agent.)

> Перевірте своє розуміння пасивних конструкцій в українській мові. (Test your current understanding of Ukrainian passive constructions.)

Прочитайте ці речення і визначте, який тип пасиву представлений у кожному. (Read these sentences and identify what type of passive each represents.)

**Тип А - Повний дієприкметник:** Використовує дієприкметник, що узгоджується з підметом (Книга написана).
**Тип Б - Коротка форма:** Використовує безособову форму на -но/-то (Книгу написано).
**Тип В - Зворотний:** Використовує дієслова на -ся (Книга пишеться).

1. Цей роман був написаний молодим автором. (This novel was written by a young author.)

### Три типи пасиву (The Three Passive Types)

Пасивний стан в українській мові — це не одна конструкція, а система трьох пов'язаних, але різних моделей. (Ukrainian passive voice isn't a single construction—it's a system of three related but distinct patterns.) Кожна має свою граматику, типові контексти та стилістичний відтінок. (Each has its own grammar, typical contexts, and stylistic flavor.)

:::tip[🔍 Pattern Discovery]
Порівняйте три способи сказати "The report was written":
- Звіт написаний директором. (The report was written by the director.) — **Повний дієприкметник**
- Звіт написано. (The report was written / has been written.) — **Коротка форма**
- Звіт пишеться щотижня. (The report is written weekly.) — **Зворотний**
:::


### Тип 1: Пасив із повним дієприкметником (Full Participle Passive)

Пасив із повним дієприкметником використовує пасивні дієприкметники минулого часу (із закінченням **-ний/-тий**), які узгоджуються з підметом у роді, числі та відмінку. (The full participle passive uses past passive participles (those ending in **-ний/-тий**) that agree with the subject in gender, number, and case.)

**Творення:**
- Підмет + бути (необов'язково в теперішньому часі) + дієприкметник (узгоджений)
- Необов'язково: агент в орудному відмінку

**Examples:**
- Книга написана письменником. (The book was written by a writer.)
- Статтю було опубліковано в журналі. (The article was published in a magazine.)
- Ці будинки побудовані минулого року. (These buildings were built last year.)
- Проєкт був виконаний командою. (The project was completed by the team.)

**When to use:** When you want to emphasize the subject or mention the agent. Common in journalistic and literary styles.

> 💡 **Did You Know: Agent Marking**
> When you mention WHO did the action, use the Instrumental case without a preposition: «Картина намальована художником» (The painting was painted by an artist). This mirrors how English uses "by" but Ukrainian grammar handles it through case endings.

### Type 2: Short Form Passive (Impersonal -но/-то)

The short form passive uses the neuter singular form of the participle (-но or -то) regardless of the grammatical subject. This creates an impersonal construction.

**Formation:**
- Object in Accusative + short participle (-но/-то)
- Optional: бути for past/future

**Examples:**
- Книгу написано. (The book has been written. — lit. "Book written.")
- Рішення прийнято. (A decision has been made.)
- Було вирішено відкласти збори. (It was decided to postpone the meeting.)
- Роботу буде завершено завтра. (The work will be completed tomorrow.)

**When to use:** When the agent is unknown, irrelevant, or intentionally omitted. Very common in official documents, announcements, and academic writing.

> 🌍 **Real World: Official Language**
> You'll encounter -но/-то forms constantly in Ukrainian bureaucracy: «Заяву прийнято» (Application accepted), «Документи оформлено» (Documents processed), «Візу видано» (Visa issued). This impersonal style conveys authority and objectivity.

### Type 3: Reflexive Passive

The reflexive passive uses verbs with the particle **-ся** to express passive meaning, particularly for ongoing or habitual actions.

**Formation:**
- Subject + verb with -ся (conjugated for person/number)

**Examples:**
- Будинок будується швидко. (The building is being built quickly.)
- Ця книга добре продається. (This book sells well.)
- Договір підписується директором. (The contract is signed by the director.)
- Нові правила впроваджуються поступово. (New rules are being implemented gradually.)

**When to use:** For processes in progress, habitual/repeated actions, or when emphasizing the process itself rather than completion.

> 🎬 **Pop Culture Moment: "Everything Will Be Ukraine"**
> The patriotic phrase «Все буде Україна» technically uses active voice, but the passive equivalent «Все буде зроблено для України» (Everything will be done for Ukraine) shows how the short-form passive creates powerful, declarative statements in political speech.

## Поглиблення

### Choosing Between Passive Types

The three passive types aren't fully interchangeable. Here's how to choose:

| Context | Best Choice | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Agent is important | Full participle | Книга написана Шевченком. |
| Agent unknown/irrelevant | Short form (-но/-то) | Книгу написано в 1840 році. |
| Ongoing process | Reflexive | Книга пишеться вже рік. |
| Official announcement | Short form | Рішення прийнято. |
| Literary description | Full participle | Земля вкрита снігом. |
| Habitual action | Reflexive | Газета видається щодня. |

### Common Participle Pairs

Many verbs have both full and short passive forms. Here are essential pairs:

| Infinitive | Full Participle | Short Form | English |
|------------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| написати | написаний | написано | written |
| зробити | зроблений | зроблено | done/made |
| прийняти | прийнятий | прийнято | accepted |
| вирішити | вирішений | вирішено | decided |
| завершити | завершений | завершено | completed |
| виконати | виконаний | виконано | performed |
| встановити | встановлений | встановлено | established |
| визначити | визначений | визначено | defined |

:::tip[Tip]
**Short form pattern:** Take the masculine full participle and change -ий/-ений to -о/-ено.
написаний → написано, завершений → завершено, зроблений → зроблено
:::


### Agreement in Full Participles

Full participles must agree with their subject:

- Лист **написаний**. (The letter [m.] is written.)
- Книга **написана**. (The book [f.] is written.)
- Завдання **написане**. (The task [n.] is written.)
- Документи **написані**. (The documents [pl.] are written.)

Short forms (-но/-то) NEVER change—they're always the same regardless of subject.

> 🎯 **Fun Fact: Slavic Divergence**
> Russian uses reflexive passive much more than Ukrainian, while Ukrainian favors the -но/-то impersonal. If you hear «Всё решено» in Russian, the Ukrainian equivalent «Все вирішено» works the same way, but Ukrainian uses this form even more extensively.

### Passive with Different Tenses

**Full Participle (with бути):**
- Present: Звіт (є) написаний. (The report is written.)
- Past: Звіт був написаний. (The report was written.)
- Future: Звіт буде написаний. (The report will be written.)

**Short Form:**
- Present: Звіт написано. (The report is/has been written.)
- Past: Звіт було написано. (The report was written.)
- Future: Звіт буде написано. (The report will be written.)

**Reflexive:**
- Present: Звіт пишеться. (The report is being written.)
- Past: Звіт писався. (The report was being written.)
- Future: Звіт буде писатися. (The report will be being written.)

> **Працівник:** Дизайн розроблений нашим новим спеціалістом. (The design was developed by our new specialist.)

### Dialogue 2: News Report


> **Ведучий:** Що відомо про ситуацію? (What is known about the situation?)

> **Кореспондент:** Рішення прийнято сьогодні вранці. (The decision was made this morning.)

> **Ведучий:** Чи оголошено офіційну заяву? (Has an official statement been announced?)

> **Кореспондент:** Заяву буде оприлюднено о п'ятій годині. (The statement will be released at five o'clock.)

> **Ведучий:** Як це сприймається населенням? (How is this being received by the population?)

> **Кореспондент:** Новина обговорюється дуже активно. (The news is being discussed very actively.)

### Dialogue 3: University Discussion


> **Студент:** Чи ця книга включена до списку літератури? (Is this book included in the reading list?)

> **Викладач:** Так, вона рекомендована для всіх студентів. (Yes, it's recommended for all students.)

> **Студент:** Коли здаються есе? (When are essays submitted?)

> **Викладач:** Есе здаються до кінця місяця. Крайній термін встановлено. (Essays are submitted by the end of the month. The deadline is set.)

> **Гість:** Так, бронювання зроблене на прізвище Коваленко. (Yes, a reservation was made under the name Kovalenko.)

> **Гість:** Що рекомендується? (What is recommended?)

> **Офіціант:** Борщ готується за старовинним рецептом. (The borscht is made according to an old recipe.)

> **Гість:** Тоді борщ! (Then borscht!)

> 🌍 **Real World: Passive in Everyday Life**

> Notice how passive forms appear constantly: «Зачинено» (Closed), «Заборонено палити» (Smoking prohibited), «Продано» (Sold). These signs use short-form passives because no agent needs mentioning.

## Stylistic Register: The Art of Distance

Choosing between active and passive voice isn't just grammar—it's **diplomacy**.

**1. Taking Responsibility (Active Voice)**
- *Я вирішив проблему.* (I solved the problem.)
- **Effect:** Strong, leadership, direct accountability.

**2. Sharing Responsibility (Full Passive)**
- *Проблема вирішена нами.* (The problem is solved by us.)
- **Effect:** Focus on the result, agent is secondary but present.

**3. Removing Responsibility (Short Passive)**
- *Проблему вирішено.* (The problem has been solved.)
- **Effect:** Bureaucratic, objective. Who did it? Doesn't matter. "The System" did it.

> 🕴️ **Professional Tip:**
> In apologies, Ukrainians often use the Short Passive to sound objective without blaming themselves directly:
> * «Рейс **скасовано** через погоду.» (The flight is cancelled due to weather.) -> Not "We cancelled the flight."
> * «Помилку **виправлено**.» (The error has been corrected.) -> Not "I fixed my mistake."

## 📋 Summary

### Key Takeaways

**Three Passive Types:**

1. **Full Participle Passive** (найчастіше з агентом)
   - Agrees with subject: написаний/написана/написане/написані
   - Agent in Instrumental: «Книга написана автором»
   - Best for: emphasizing subject, mentioning agent

2. **Short Form Passive** (-но/-то)
   - Never changes: завжди «написано»
   - Object often in Accusative: «Книгу написано»
   - Best for: official style, unknown agent, impersonal statements

3. **Reflexive Passive** (-ся)
   - Conjugates: пишеться, пишуться, писався, писалася
   - Best for: ongoing processes, habitual actions

**Quick Decision Guide:**
- Need to mention WHO did it? → Full participle
- Official announcement or unknown agent? → Short form (-но/-то)
- Ongoing process or habit? → Reflexive (-ся)

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- Don't use short form (-но/-то) when you need agreement
- Don't use reflexive for completed one-time actions
- Remember: -но/-то NEVER changes form
