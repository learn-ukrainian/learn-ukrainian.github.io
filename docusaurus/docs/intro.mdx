## Find a Teacher First

> **Учитель – це професія від Бога, усі решта професій – від учителя.**
>
> *A teacher is a profession from God; all other professions come from the teacher.*

**No app, website, or course can replace a qualified native teacher.** This curriculum is designed to supplement — not replace — human instruction. Before diving into self-study:

1.  **Find a native Ukrainian teacher** — Online platforms like [Preply](https://preply.com) (Ukrainian company) or local Ukrainian communities
2.  **Join a class** — Many Ukrainian cultural centers offer group lessons
3.  **Practice with native speakers** — Language exchange, conversation partners, Ukrainian friends
