## Find a Teacher First

> **Учитель – це професія від Бога, усі решта професій – від учителя.**
>
> *A teacher is a profession from God; all other professions come from the teacher.*

**No app, website, or course can replace a qualified native teacher.** This curriculum is designed to supplement — not replace — human instruction. Before diving into self-study:

1. **Find a native Ukrainian teacher** — Online platforms like [Preply](https://preply.com) (Ukrainian company) or local Ukrainian communities
2. **Join a class** — Many Ukrainian cultural centers offer group lessons
3. **Practice with native speakers** — Language exchange, conversation partners, Ukrainian friends

A good teacher will correct your pronunciation, explain cultural nuances, and adapt to your learning style in ways no app ever can.
