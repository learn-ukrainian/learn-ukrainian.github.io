# How We Work (Mandatory Workflow)

<critical>

## Cold-start sequence (do this first every session)

Use the Monitor API instead of reading files. A session with a known assigned
functional role opts into that role's bounded pointer-only cold start:

```python
from ai_agent_bridge.monitor_client import MonitorClient
boot = MonitorClient().bootstrap(role="quality")
  # boot["rules"].body     — condensed rules markdown
  # boot["session"].body   — condensed session summary
  # boot["research"].body  — role-scoped pointers only, if enabled
```

Generic or genuinely role-unknown startup stays pointer-free:

```python
boot = MonitorClient().bootstrap()
```

There is no hidden default role. `bootstrap()` remains the generic, silent
path; add `role="..."` only when the session already has that known assigned
functional role.

Shell equivalent:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8765/api/state/manifest         # ~1 KB index
curl -s http://localhost:8765/api/rules?format=markdown  # only if hash changed
curl -s 'http://localhost:8765/api/session/current?agent=orchestrator'  # only if hash changed
curl -s http://localhost:8765/api/orient                 # always-fresh, has meta
curl -s 'http://localhost:8765/api/comms/inbox?agent=claude'  # unread messages
```

**Do NOT read `CLAUDE.md`, `agents_extensions/shared/rules/*.md`, or
`docs/session-state/current.md` directly on cold start.** Those are
the source of truth the endpoints above serve. Reading them separately
costs 5+ tool calls and ignores the hash-based cache. If an endpoint
is unreachable (API server down), THEN fall back to files.

For Claude specifically, `.claude/rules/` now carries only a small API
pointer plus path-scoped rules. The canonical always-load rule set for
Claude is `/api/rules?format=markdown`; use the source files directly
only as the offline fallback above.

After a write that needs to be immediately visible (just-committed
change, just-filed issue), pass `?fresh=true` to `/api/orient`.

**Canary mint (orchestrator sessions, user go 2026-07-07):** after orientation,
freeze 8-10 anchors from the facts just gathered (origin/main SHA, open-PR numbers,
queue/corpus counts): `.venv/bin/python scripts/context_canary.py mint --facts
'<json {id,q,a} list>' --out .agent/canary-<stamp>.json`. Score FROM MEMORY (no
scrolling back) at ≥50% of the active model's window and before any handoff. Rot
evidence is PER-MODEL (Claude lane rotates: Opus 4.8 verified, Fable 5 improvised
10/10 @ ~500K, Sonnet 5 pending) — on a not-yet-canaried model this is mandatory.

## Merge policy — ready PRs must not sit (user directive 2026-07-07, #4703)

The repo setting `allow_auto_merge` is ENABLED (was the root cause of ready PRs sitting for
hours). Every lane: the moment a PR's review gate passes (cross-family review evidence, no
requested changes), run `gh pr merge <N> --auto --squash --delete-branch` — GitHub merges it
when CI settles, nobody babysits. Dispatched agents still do NOT self-enable auto-merge
(review gate first — unchanged). `--auto` waits for green and never bypasses blocking checks
(#M-0.5 semantics unchanged). Orchestrator session sweeps remain the backstop — but ONLY for
out-of-lane PRs that have sat green (CI passing + review gate passed) idle for MORE THAN
1 HOUR (user directive 2026-07-07): a fresh PR belongs to its lane. Do not shepherd,
review-route, or arm auto-merge on another lane's PR before that threshold.

## Two-tier handoffs (epic #1865 item #1, shipped 2026-05-11)

Thread rollover handoffs are separate from durable session records. When a
thread approaches context threshold, run
`.venv/bin/python scripts/orchestration/thread_handoff.py prepare --agent <name>`
and continue from `.agent/<name>-thread-bootstrap.md` plus
`.agent/<name>-thread-handoff.md`. Those files are gitignored local state.
Do **not** write `docs/session-state/current.md` or any other git-tracked
handoff file just to survive compaction.

Every new durable session handoff ships as **MD brief only** (user decision 2026-07-07 —
the HTML halves were not being read):

- **`docs/session-state/<date>-<slug>-brief.md`** (~2-5KB) — machine-readable, cold-start
  entry point. YAML frontmatter + bullet-list body. Agents AND the human read THIS.
- HTML companion ONLY on explicit request or for major milestone arcs — never by default.

**Cold-start rule:** after the Monitor API bootstrap above, use the agent-specific
session endpoint when you know your role:

```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:8765/api/session/current?agent=claude'
curl -s 'http://localhost:8765/api/session/current?agent=codex'
curl -s 'http://localhost:8765/api/session/current?agent=gemini'
curl -s 'http://localhost:8765/api/session/current?agent=orchestrator'
```

`docs/session-state/current.md` is a git-tracked compatibility router, not a
scratchpad and not the context-threshold rollover mechanism. It keeps
`Latest-Brief: docs/session-state/current.orchestrator.md` for legacy API
compatibility and an `Agent-Handoff:` mapping for `current.<agent>.md`. Read
the router only to discover paths; detailed state belongs in the agent-specific
file. Do NOT read the `.html` unless the agent-specific handoff points you
there.

### Brief frontmatter schema (required fields)

```yaml
---
date: 2026-05-10                              # YYYY-MM-DD
session: "Evening — short title"              # human-readable session label

detail: <date>-<slug>.html                    # paired HTML filename, relative to docs/session-state/
main_sha: 99d3844e9                           # short SHA at end-of-session
main_green: true                              # CI state on main
open_prs: 0                                   # count at end-of-session

next_p0: "one-line description of next priority"
agents: [claude, codex, gemini]               # agents that participated
---
```

Optional/extensible fields are allowed (e.g. `ci_notes`, `worktrees_open`, `incidents`) but the required block above MUST be present for cold-start parsing.

### Brief body shape

After the frontmatter, the body is a **bullet-list summary**, NOT narrative. Recommended sections:

1. `## TL;DR` — 2-4 lines.
2. `## What shipped` — table of PR/issue with one-line "what".
3. `## What rejected` (if any) — short reason + lesson encoded.
4. `## Carry-over queue` — priority-ordered list of items NOT done.
5. `## Decisions encoded` — short bullets.
6. `## Pending decisions` (if any) — links to `docs/decisions/pending/*`.
7. `## Cold-start orientation for next agent` — explicit instructions to the next session.

Reserve all narrative, anecdotes, KPIs, and rich rationale for the `.html` companion. The brief is a state snapshot, not a story.

### Pair authoring rule

Brief and HTML are authored together in the same orchestrator turn. Never ship one without the other for sessions going forward.

Every approved compatibility-router update to `docs/session-state/current.md`
MUST keep the top-level `Latest-Brief:` marker and the `Agent-Handoff:` mapping
parseable. Non-orchestrator agents update only
`docs/session-state/current.<agent>.md` unless a task explicitly authorizes a
router update. The SessionStart hook no longer reads this router by default;
set `SESSION_HANDOFF_ALLOW_GIT_ROUTER=1` only for legacy compatibility tests or
an explicitly approved router-oriented cold start.

### Backfill policy

Older `current.md` rows are HTML-only. Backfill is OPTIONAL — only worth it if a future thread needs to re-pickup that session. The cold-start fallback handles the missing-brief case.

## Scoped queries — call the API instead of filesystem spelunking

When you need deterministic answers about a specific module / range /
worktree, use these endpoints instead of grepping `orchestration/`,
`status/`, or `review/` directly. They are the source of truth for
agent-side reasoning.

| Question | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| What's module `{slug}` doing right now? | `GET /api/state/module/{track}/slug/{slug}` |
| Give me the dashboard for modules N..M on {track} | `GET /api/state/range/{track}?start=N&end=M` |
| Which files would `--force` delete for this module? | `GET /api/artifacts/{track}/{slug}/force-preview` |
| Classify every file tied to this module (source/generated/published/stale) | `GET /api/artifacts/{track}/{slug}/files` |
| Latest main + style reviews + "reviewer gaming" flag | `GET /api/artifacts/{track}/{slug}/review-snapshot` |
| Does state.json agree with audit / reviews / published MDX? | `GET /api/artifacts/{track}/{slug}/drift` |
| Can I ship this module? (every gate green) | `GET /api/artifacts/{track}/{slug}` |
| Aggregate list of ship-ready modules | `GET /api/artifacts/ship-ready[?track=...]` |
| Is the public site actually reachable? | `GET /api/site/health` |
| Recent GH Pages deployments | `GET /api/site/deployments` |
| Which worktrees exist and which branches are they on? | `GET /api/worktrees` |
| Open issues grouped by category, with supersede hints | `GET /api/issues/map` |
| Per-agent auth mode (Gemini subscription vs API) | `GET /api/runtime/auth` |

**Rule of thumb:** if you're about to run `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, or
`find` against `curriculum/` / `orchestration/` / `review/` /
`status/` / `.git/worktrees/` — check the table above first. A
single API call almost always returns the structured answer you
were trying to reconstruct.

**Full reference:** [`docs/MONITOR-API.md`](../../docs/MONITOR-API.md).

### Don't confuse `claude agents` with active-dispatch state

The Claude Code v2.1.139 `claude agents` command is a **static
configuration lister**, not a live-session view. Its output lists
loaded agent DEFINITIONS (e.g. `curriculum-orchestrator`, `Explore`,
`Plan`, `claude`) and labels them "active" — meaning "loaded into the
current process," NOT "running a session." Verified 2026-05-12 against
Claude Code 2.1.139 (`claude agents --format json` is rejected with
`unknown option`; only the plaintext lister exists).

To check ACTIVE DISPATCHES, use `/api/delegate/active` (Monitor API).
To check OPEN PRs, use `gh pr list`. To check IN-FLIGHT WORKTREES,
use `/api/worktrees`. `claude agents` does not replace any of these.

(Encoded 2026-05-12 after queue item #2 in `2026-05-12-cold-start-followups-brief.md` was filed under the wrong assumption.)

## Work intake — stream epics (#4708, binding for ALL orchestrators incl. Codex UI)

Every OPEN issue belongs to **exactly one stream epic**. The registry is
`scripts/config/issue_streams.yaml` (streams → epic numbers; mirrored in
`docs/WORKSTREAMS.md` § Streams). This is how orchestrators stay on track and schedule:

- **Cold start**: your queue = YOUR stream's epic checklist/sub-issues, not the global
  issue list. Check `/api/issues/streams` (or the session-setup 11b warning) for drift.
- **Creating an issue**: link it to its stream epic AT CREATION — native sub-issue
  (preferred) or a `#N` checklist line in the epic body. An unlinked issue is an ORPHAN
  and gets flagged at every agent's cold start until adopted.
- **Closing**: when a PR fixes an issue, CLOSE it with evidence (auto-close keywords are
  fine, but verify — `Fixes #N` closes the whole issue even when scope remains; split
  remainders into a new linked issue FIRST).
- **New stream?** Only with a new epic + a registry entry in the same PR — streams are
  deliberate, not emergent.
- Auditor: `.venv/bin/python -m scripts.orchestration.issue_stream_audit` (`--check` for
  gates, `--migrate` to convert body references into native sub-issues).

## Mandatory task workflow

Every task follows this workflow. No exceptions for non-trivial changes.

1. **Create GH issue** — describe the problem, draft a plan, **link it to its stream epic** (see Work intake above)
2. **Adversarial review of plan** — send to Gemini, incorporate feedback
3. **Finalize ACs** — update issue with concrete acceptance criteria
4. **Implement** — work through ACs one by one
5. **Verify all ACs** — every AC checked and documented on the issue
6. **Adversarial review of implementation** — send code to Gemini, fix findings
7. **Close** — only when all ACs pass and review is clean

**Goal-Driven Execution (step 4)**: Transform imperative tasks into verifiable goals. For multi-step work, state a plan with explicit verification at each step:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```
Strong success criteria enable independent looping. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**Skip plan review** (step 2) only for trivial changes (< 50 lines, config/typo fixes).

**Adversarial review command** (steps 2 & 6). Always use `--model gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. Document findings on the GH issue.
```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/ai_agent_bridge/__main__.py ask-gemini \
  "Adversarial review for #NNN. Read {path}." \
  --task-id issue-NNN --model gemini-3.1-pro-preview
```

## Channel bridge (#1190, shipped 2026-04-12)

The agent bridge now supports **topic-scoped channels** — preferred
for sustained multi-turn conversations because they eliminate the
need to re-paste project context on every round.

**Five seeded channels**: `shared`, `pipeline`, `content`,
`architecture`, `reviews`. Every post auto-prepends:
1. The channel's pinned `context.md` (via the include chain, so
   `shared` is merged into everything)
2. A Monitor API snapshot of volatile project state
3. Recent channel history, character-budget truncated

**Preferred for:** code reviews (multi-round), design debates,
cross-agent discussions, anything that needs pinned context.
**Not preferred for:** one-off drive-by questions — use `ask-*` for
those.

**Quick reference**:
```bash
  # List / inspect
ab channel list
ab channel info pipeline
ab channel tail reviews -n 20
ab channel tail reviews --thread THREAD_ID

  # Post (short form — single recipient)
ab p reviews gemini "quick question about module X"

  # Post (long form — multi-recipient, threading, parent/corr ids)
ab post reviews "Review of #NNN" --to gemini,codex --parent MSG_ID

  # Multi-agent bounded discussion
ab discuss architecture "Should we extract the V6 god object?" \
    --with claude,gemini,codex --max-rounds 2
```

`ab discuss` runs rounds in parallel via ThreadPoolExecutor,
short-circuits when all agents end their response with `[AGREE]`,
and caps at 4 rounds. Default: 2 rounds, 1 agent. The transcript
lands in `channel_messages` with proper `parent_id` threading so
you can tail it later with `ab channel tail --thread`.

**Web dashboard**: `http://localhost:8765/channels.html` (localhost
only, read + post).

**Full docs**: `docs/best-practices/agent-bridge.md`.

The legacy `ask-gemini` / `ask-claude` / `ask-codex` commands are
NOT deprecated — they stay alive for one-shot delegations. Use
channels for anything that will have >1 turn.

**Why**: GH issues are persistent memory. Without them, context is lost between sessions and work gets repeated or silently broken.

**Issue discipline (coding issues)**:
- **Never leave half-done.** If you open it, finish it. If you can't finish it now, document exactly where you stopped and what remains.
- **Never close unless ALL acceptance criteria are verified.** Partial completion = still open.
- **Aim to fully resolve and close.** Open issues are debt. Minimize them aggressively.
- **The human manages content generation issues.** Claude owns coding/infrastructure issues. But proactively remind when it's time to start building a new track or batch — initiative is welcome.

**Proactive issue hygiene**: At the start of each session, check open coding issues. Prioritize, resolve, close — don't let them go stale.
