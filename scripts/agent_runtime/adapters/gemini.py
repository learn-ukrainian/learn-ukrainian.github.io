"""GeminiAdapter — wraps ``gemini`` CLI (Google AI Studio / Gemini CLI) for the runtime.

Second real adapter. Pressure-tests the protocol against the RICHEST existing
flag requirements in the codebase:

- MCP tool restrictions via ``--allowed-mcp-server-names`` (used by
  ``scripts/build/dispatch.py`` for pipeline reviewers to restrict tool
  access).
- Stall detection: the prior art in ``_gemini.py::_stream_with_watchdog``
  was specifically built because Gemini CLI stalls frequently. Our runtime's
  stall watchdog covers this case uniformly — GeminiAdapter doesn't need a
  custom implementation, just the right ``stall_timeout`` default.
- Rate-limit detection: Gemini returns ``RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED``, ``quota
  exceeded``, and occasionally ``No capacity available`` depending on
  backend. Patterns match dispatch.py prior art.
- No session IDs. Gemini CLI doesn't expose them, so ``parse_response``
  returns ``session_id=None`` always. Resume policy is ``bridge_only``
  for cost economics, but session IDs come from the bridge's own SQLite
  ``sessions`` table and are passed in as ``session_id=...`` — we just
  ignore it here because the CLI has no ``--resume`` equivalent anyway.

Key differences from CodexAdapter:
- Output to stdout (no ``-o <file>``); ``output_file`` stays None.
- No sandbox flags. Gemini CLI uses ``--approval-mode=yolo`` for
  writable mode; read-only is the default. There is no ``danger`` mode
  distinct from ``workspace-write``.
- Liveness paths = () — stdout streaming is the only signal we need,
  and it's sufficient because Gemini CLI always writes to stdout.

        Why the fallback exists (2026-04-10): the Gemini CLI block-buffers
        stdout when not connected to a TTY. On long calls (MCP tool use +
        internal retries) the CLI can finish and write its full response
        to the session file while stdout is still sitting in a kernel
        buffer that never gets flushed before proc.kill() on hard_timeout.
        Result: the pipeline used to discard completed responses and
        retry forever, even though the answer was already on disk.

        The fix reads the newest session file after every call and uses
        it if stdout is empty OR the call was killed. The session file

        Original design (issue #1184) assumed stdout streaming was sufficient
        for Gemini because ``_stream_with_watchdog`` in the prior art worked
        that way. That assumption was WRONG in two ways:

        1. The gemini CLI uses block-buffered stdout when its stdout isn't a
           TTY (subprocess pipe). It can emit nothing for 3+ minutes during
           reasoning bursts, even when actively working — the final message
           gets flushed all at once near the end.
        2. bufsize=1 on the Popen side only controls OUR read buffering.
           We can't force Gemini to flush its own writes.

        Result before this fix: watchdog fired spurious stalls on long
        Gemini calls that were actually succeeding (session files on disk
        proved it). See 2026-04-10 incident — a 319s skeleton generation
        was killed at 181s even though Gemini wrote to ``logs.json`` at
        319s mark.

        Fix: walk the gemini tmp directory for this project and return
        any file/dir whose mtime bumps during exec. The CLI updates:
          - ``~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/logs.json`` — bumps on every tool
            call or status update (verified: modified during exec).
          - ``~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/`` — directory mtime bumps
            when a new session JSON file is created at the start of exec.
          - ``~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/session-*.json`` — newest
            session file grows as messages stream in.

        ``<project>`` is the cwd basename per gemini-cli convention. We
        read it from ``plan.cwd`` (stamped by the adapter in
        ``build_invocation``) rather than ``os.getcwd()`` so the adapter
        is not coupled to ambient process state. Refactored 2026-04-10
