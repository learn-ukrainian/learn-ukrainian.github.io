"""CodexAdapter — wraps ``codex exec`` for the agent runtime.

First real adapter. Proves the protocol shape works against a real CLI.
Lifted from the prior art in ``scripts/ai_agent_bridge/_codex.py`` and
``scripts/build/dispatch.py`` (Codex branch) — same flag semantics, now
routed through the unified runtime.

Key design points:

- **Fresh session always.** CodexAdapter has ``resume_policy="never"`` in
  the registry AND defensively ignores ``session_id`` even if passed.
  Belt + suspenders against the cross-worktree contamination footgun that
  Codex flagged in his own consultation (msg #28506).
- **All three modes supported:** read-only, workspace-write, danger.
  Mode → flag mapping matches ``_codex.py::_codex_bridge_flags`` and
  ``dispatch.py::_codex_dispatch_flags``.
- **Output file always used.** ``codex exec -o <tmpfile>`` writes the final
  agent message to a file; we read it in ``parse_response``. The file path
  goes into ``liveness_signal_paths`` so the runner's mtime poller catches
  Codex writing progress even when stdout is quiet.
- **Session ID parsed from stdout.** The CLI prints "session id: <uuid>"
  somewhere in stdout; we extract it for the usage record even though
  we never resume it.

    message AFTER the last divider — in the "codex" or equivalent
    section. The echoed user prompt can contain ANY text, including
    legitimate inline dashes-only lines (a code block showing a
    divider, a Markdown horizontal rule, a consultation prompt
    literally discussing rate limits). Any regex that tries to
    identify "the prompt block" by matching between two dividers can
    be defeated by a prompt containing its own dividers.

    Fix: don't try to strip the prompt at all. Instead, take the
    stderr body AFTER the LAST divider line — that region is
    guaranteed to be Codex's own output, never echoed prompt, because
    the prompt echo always appears before Codex's response section.
    If there are no dividers at all (degenerate cases: truncated
    output, early crash before banner), fall back to the whole
    stderr.

        cross-contaminate. Instead we:

        1. Snapshot the set of rollout files that existed at the

           as ``_rollout_snapshot``).
        2. On every scan, ignore any file in the snapshot.
        3. From the non-snapshot candidates, pick the one with the
           newest mtime. This is guaranteed to be a file Codex created
           AFTER our call started.
        4. Once we find a candidate, we cache it as ``_bound_rollout``
           — any future calls return the SAME file, so the runner's
           parse_response always sees the rollout scoped to THIS

            and tool calls are streamed to disk. Confirmed: a 9-minute
            consultation run had its rollout file at 409KB and still
            growing.
          - ``sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/`` (the directory) only bumps on
            child file *creation*, not on content writes. Useful for
            catching the startup signal but goes silent during the run.
          - ``state_5.sqlite`` bumps intermittently (not reliably on
            every message). Kept as a secondary signal.
          - ``logs_1.sqlite``, ``history.jsonl`` are stale in 0.118+
            but kept as fallbacks for older CLI versions.
          - ``plan.output_file`` is the -o target; empty during the run

            a signal for the "Codex is writing the final response" moment.
