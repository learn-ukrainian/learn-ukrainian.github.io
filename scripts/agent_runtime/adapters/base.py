"""AgentAdapter protocol + InvocationPlan dataclass.

The protocol defines the three methods every agent adapter must implement.
The InvocationPlan dataclass is the return type of ``build_invocation()`` —
everything the runner needs to spawn one subprocess.

Design rationale (from consultation, see docs/design/agent-runtime.md v1 Changelog):

- ``build_invocation`` takes ``session_id`` and ``tool_config`` as inputs —
  Gemini review #1 and #3 caught that omitting these would silently break
  dispatch.py MCP tool restrictions and bridge resume semantics.
- ``parse_response`` returns a rich ``ParseResult`` instead of 3 separate
  protocol methods — Codex review #1 showed the v0 design
  (``detect_rate_limit()`` + ``extract_session_id()`` as separate methods)
  didn't fit all three agents (Claude creates session ID pre-launch, Codex
  parses post-exec, Gemini does neither).
- ``liveness_signal_paths`` is NEW in v1 — enables file-mtime stall detection
  as a fallback when stdout is redirected to ``-o <file>`` or otherwise
  buffered, complementing the runner's primary stdout streaming watchdog.

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class InvocationPlan:
    """Everything needed to spawn one agent subprocess.

    Returned by ``adapter.build_invocation()``. The runner consumes it and
    passes the fields to ``subprocess.Popen``.

    Fields:
        cmd: The argv list, ready for Popen. Includes all flags, model
            overrides, output redirection, etc. First element is the binary
            name (e.g. ``"codex"``, ``"npx"``, ``"gemini"``).
        cwd: Working directory the runner will set on Popen. Adapters must
            stamp this with the ``cwd`` they received in ``build_invocation``
            so that later protocol methods — particularly
            ``liveness_signal_paths(plan)`` — can derive cwd-dependent paths
            (e.g. Gemini's ``~/.gemini/tmp/<basename>/``) without reading
            the ambient process cwd via ``os.getcwd()``. Added 2026-04-10
            to remove the hack that coupled adapters to process state.
        stdin_payload: Text to pipe to the subprocess's stdin. Empty string
            if the prompt is embedded in ``cmd`` instead.
        output_file: Path where the subprocess will write its final output,
            if any. Adapters that use ``codex exec -o <file>`` or
            ``gemini --output-path <file>`` populate this; the runner reads
            it on completion. None if output goes to stdout.
        env_overrides: Env vars to add to the subprocess environment.
            Merged onto ``os.environ`` fresh per invocation — NEVER
            ``os.environ.update()``. Adapters should only set values that
            are specific to this call (e.g. Gemini auth tokens). Values set
            here leak nowhere else.
        liveness_paths: Files whose mtime indicates the agent is alive.
            Used by the runner's stall detector as a fallback when stdout
            is buffered/redirected. Can be empty; if so, only stdout
            streaming is used for liveness.
