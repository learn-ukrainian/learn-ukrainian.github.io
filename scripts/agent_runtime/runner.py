"""Runner — the single entrypoint for all agent CLI invocations.

``runner.invoke(agent_name, prompt, ...)`` is the one public function every
caller in the codebase should use. Bridge, dispatch, delegate (future),
consult (future) — all route through here. No bespoke subprocess building
anywhere else.

Flow (see docs/design/agent-runtime.md § 4.2 for the full spec):

    1. Look up adapter class in registry, import it, instantiate.
    2. Validate mode is in adapter.supported_modes.
    3. Validate cwd is provided for write modes.
    4. Enforce resume policy: delegate/dispatch entrypoints may not pass
       session_id for agents with resume_policy="bridge_only".
    5. Check has_headroom(agent, model) — raise RateLimitedError pre-call
       if we're known rate-limited.
    6. Adapter builds the InvocationPlan.
    7. Spawn subprocess via Popen with watchdog (stall detection).
    8. Poll should_kill() every second; on return or kill, stop watchdog.
    9. Adapter parses the response into ParseResult.
    10. Build Result, write usage record atomically, return Result.
    11. On any failure, write a usage record with the appropriate outcome
        and raise the matching exception.

        # ~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/session-*.json. On a hard_timeout
        # kill, stdout is empty but the session file has the full (or
        # partial-but-usable) response. GeminiAdapter.parse_response reads
        # that file and returns ok=True with the recovered response.

        # The old flow raised AgentTimeoutError immediately on kill and
        # never gave the adapter a chance to recover. That forced the
        # dispatcher's cascade to retry the same call on a different
        # model — wasting another 15 minutes on work that was ALREADY
        # DONE and sitting on disk.
