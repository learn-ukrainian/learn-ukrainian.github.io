"""Shared usage logger for the agent runtime.

Every invocation through ``runner.invoke()`` writes exactly one JSONL record
here. The file layout reuses ``batch_state/api_usage/`` so the existing
``/api/batch/usage`` endpoint at ``scripts/api/main.py:152`` surfaces
per-agent + per-entrypoint cost data with zero new plumbing.

File layout::

    batch_state/api_usage/usage_<agent>-<entrypoint>_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl

Examples::

    batch_state/api_usage/usage_codex-bridge_2026-04-10.jsonl
    batch_state/api_usage/usage_gemini-dispatch_2026-04-10.jsonl
    batch_state/api_usage/usage_claude-delegate_2026-04-10.jsonl

Atomicity: we use ``os.open(O_APPEND | O_CREAT | O_WRONLY)`` + single
``os.write()`` per line, bypassing Python's buffered I/O entirely. POSIX
guarantees ``write(2)`` with ``O_APPEND`` is atomic across concurrent writers
for payloads smaller than ``PIPE_BUF`` (typically 4KB). Our JSONL records
are always < 2KB so we're well inside the guarantee. No filelock dependency.

Headroom check: ``has_headroom(agent, model)`` scans the last 15 minutes
of records scoped by ``(agent, model)`` and returns False if any record
has ``outcome == "rate_limited"`` within that window. The runner calls
this pre-invocation and raises ``RateLimitedError`` if headroom is False
— saves the quota slot that would otherwise be burned on a known-rate-
limited call. The window was reduced from 5h to 15min on 2026-04-10
after a transient 429 false-locked the quota for 5 hours on real
builds; see ``_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_S`` for the full story.

Issue: #1184. Supersedes standalone #1183.

# Rate-limit window in seconds. History:
#   2026-04-09: 5 hours (way too long; one false 429 nuked 5 hours of build)
#   2026-04-10: 15 minutes (still blocked actively-responding Gemini for
#               14+ minutes after a stale transient-429 record)
#   2026-04-11: 5 minutes — see _MIN_EVENTS_TO_BLOCK below for the
#               complementary "isolated event = ignore" rule.
#
# Philosophy:
#   - True quota exhaustion IS rare for us (Google AI Pro subscription,
#     not API key rate limits). When it does happen, the next call after
#     5 minutes either confirms the lock or clears it.
#   - Transient server-capacity issues are common and clear in seconds.
#     The CLI retries them internally. We must not block on them.
#   - An ISOLATED rate-limit event in the window is treated as transient
#     noise and DOES NOT block. Two or more events in the window means
#     the quota is actually exhausted, and we block.
_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_S = 5 * 60

# Minimum number of rate-limit events in the window required to actually
# block. A single isolated event is almost always a transient that the
# CLI's internal retry already handled — blocking on it just penalizes
# the next attempt for an issue that's already cleared.
_MIN_EVENTS_TO_BLOCK = 2

# Even if multiple events accumulated in the window, the issue has
# probably cleared by the time the most recent event is older than this
# many seconds. Real quota lockouts produce a continuous stream of 429s,
# not a brief flurry followed by silence. If the latest event is
# stale-by-this-much, we trust the model is responding again.
