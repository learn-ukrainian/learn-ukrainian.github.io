# V7 UPGRADE writer — preserve and expand an existing module

Mode: upgrade. Base level: {BASE_LEVEL}. Module: {SLUG}.
Your current published unit: {LESSON_SCOPE}.

Upgrade the supplied built module into the deterministic lesson map below.
Do not write a plan, retrieve a wiki packet, or author a replacement from scratch.
The original plan and artifacts are input evidence, never files you may change.
Return artifacts for the current lesson only using the existing V7 output contract.

## Lesson contract

Each lesson is a 60-minute block: warm-up and retrieval, Ukrainian-first presentation,
dialogue and breakdown, guided practice, independent practice, recap and next step.
Preserve every original paragraph in its mapped section and lesson verbatim, exactly
once across the split (only whitespace and deterministic stress annotation may differ).
The introduction belongs to lesson 1. Keep original section headings and activity IDs.
Expand with useful transitions, explanations and breakdown tables; never pad or repeat
paragraphs to meet the floor. Each lesson must meet its word_target (minimum 550);
the whole module must reach at least 2000 prose tokens. The final lesson closes the module. On that lesson, end with a bilingual heading
`### Підсумок модуля — Module summary` and 4–7 bilingual bullets of what the
learner can now do (module 9 shape). Do **not** title it `Завершення модуля` /
`Module completion`, and do **not** put that close in a support table.

Follow docs/best-practices/ulp-presentation-pattern.md and the v4 lesson contract.
Use a direct, friendly teaching voice with NO named narrator and NO self-introduction.
Named people occur only inside dialogues. Do not adopt any reference author's persona
or lesson structure. A quotation must be visibly marked, attributed, and have a matching
entry in resources.yaml (Ресурси). Preserve source provenance.
Ukrainian comes first, with English scaffolding appropriate to the supplied learner state
and to **this module's original A1 mix** (do not clone module 9's adjectives lesson;
clone only its close/summary *shape*). Added Ukrainian passages of three or more
sentences require side-by-side English support. Write dialogues as > blockquotes,
never as code fences; put the English breakdown after.

**Why you must call `sources` / VESUM — not as a ritual, as the reason this page is better Ukrainian.**
A fluent model still mixes Russian calques, wrong gender, wrong government, and invented
example sentences. VESUM is the dictionary of record for lemma, gender, aspect, and
rections. Looking it up is what makes the line teachable. This run is also a **test of
the sources tools**: we will check your tool trace. If you never call them, we cannot
tell they work, and this corpus is the dataset for a Ukrainian LLM — guessed forms
become the next model's errors. If a lookup misses, mark `<!-- VERIFY: … -->` and do
not invent. Stress marks still come from the pipeline annotator after review; do not
invent stressed spellings.

A1 landing overview (lesson 1 only): if the original module opening (text before the first `##`) has no "By the end, you can" after tables/tips/code fences are ignored, also return:

```markdown file=landing-overview.md
```

Shape = module 9, not a clone: (1) 1–2 short English-carrier paragraphs with bold Ukrainian targets, (2) "By the end, you can:" 4–7 communicative bullets, (3) one "keep the scope small" sentence. Vary the hook. No `:::tip`, no markdown tables, no `Привіт!` narrator. If the cleaned original already has "By the end, you can", do **not** write this file.

A2+ upgrade: full Ukrainian immersion. Do not write English-carrier landings or landing-overview.md.

## Activities and vocabulary

Keep every original activity's type, items, answer flags and groups structurally intact.
Use provenance to find its assigned lesson. Inline IDs stay unchanged; id-less workbook
originals use act-w1, act-w2, etc. Add distinct activities with globally unique IDs.
Each lesson needs >=10 activities: 4–6 inline and 6–9 workbook; >=6 items each unless
the deterministic map declares an original-item exemption. Do not create exemptions.
Use <!-- INJECT_ACTIVITY: id --> for each inline activity, once, in its relevant section.
Use only the base A1 placement/type matrix below. Preserve every option of odd-one-out.

Allocate each original vocabulary entry once, at its first teaching use. Keep the union
equal to the original vocabulary, with >=12 complete entries per lesson. Learner knowledge
is cumulative: prior-module vocabulary plus entries introduced in previous lessons.
Every entry needs lemma, translation, pos, usage. Every lesson needs nonempty resources
with title plus url, chunk_id or source. The landing page aggregates these artifacts.

## Response format

Return exactly four named fenced blocks, with no other commentary:
```markdown file=module.md
(the current lesson's complete preserved-and-expanded prose)
```
```json file=activities.yaml
{"inline": [], "workbook": []}
```
```json file=vocabulary.yaml
[]
```
```json file=resources.yaml
[]
```
The arrays above describe the syntax; empty artifacts fail the gates. Structured artifacts
must be strict JSON inside the fences; V7 writes them as YAML. Do not return lessons.yaml.
