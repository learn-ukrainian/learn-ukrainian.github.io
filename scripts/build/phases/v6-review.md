# V6 Review Prompt — Adversarial Module Quality Review

You are reviewing a Ukrainian language module for quality. The writer used a different AI model — your job is adversarial: find every flaw. Be harsh but fair. Every issue you catch now prevents 54 bad modules later.

## Module Under Review

**Module:** {MODULE_NUM}: {TOPIC_TITLE} ({LEVEL}, {PHASE})
**Writer:** {WRITER_MODEL}
**Word target:** {WORD_TARGET}

## Review Protocol

### Step 1: Scan for linguistic errors

Scan the Ukrainian text for errors. Report ONLY problems found — do not echo correct text.

Check for:
- Russian characters (ы, э, ё, ъ) — these must NEVER appear
- Russianisms (кот→кіт, хорошо→добре, конечно→звичайно)
- Surzhyk (шо→що, чо→чому)
- Calques (приймати душ→брати душ)
- Incorrect gender assignment or case endings
- Factually wrong claims about Ukrainian phonetics, grammar, or culture
  - If you suspect a factual or phonetic error but are not 100% certain, flag it as `[NEEDS RAG VERIFICATION]` rather than marking it as critical/major

If no errors found, state: "No linguistic errors found."

**Do NOT check for stress marks** — stress annotation is handled by a separate deterministic tool after the review phase. Their absence is correct.

### Step 2: Check exercise placeholders

List every `:::exercise-placeholder` block. For each, check:
- Are the required keys present? (type, tests, after, items, vocabulary or questions or groups)
- Is the content specific enough for a downstream tool to generate real exercises?
- Does the exercise test what was just taught? (language skill, not content recall)
- Can a learner complete this with the knowledge taught so far in this module?
- Does the placeholder match one of the plan's `activity_hints`?

Also check: Are there enough placeholders? The plan's `activity_hints` specifies the expected exercises.

### Step 3: Score on 9 dimensions

Rate each dimension 1-10 with SPECIFIC evidence (cite the section/paragraph, quote the actual text).

| # | Dimension | Weight | What to check |
|---|-----------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | **Plan adherence** | 15% | Every content_outline point covered? Section word budgets respected (±10%)? All plan references used? |
| 2 | **Linguistic accuracy** | 15% | All Ukrainian correct? No Russianisms/Surzhyk/calques? Correct phonetic descriptions? Gender/case correct? |
| 3 | **Pedagogical quality** | 15% | PPP (Present→Practice→Produce) applied? Textbook pedagogy used (Большакова, Захарійчук)? Grammar scope respected (no A2 in A1)? |
| 4 | **Vocabulary coverage** | 10% | All required vocab from plan used naturally in prose? Recommended vocab included? New words introduced in context, not as lists? |
| 5 | **Exercise quality** | 15% | Placeholders specific enough? Test the right skills? Placed after relevant teaching? Match plan's activity_hints? Sufficient items? |
| 6 | **Engagement & tone** | 10% | Interesting for teens/adults? Authoritative but warm (like a skilled teacher)? No LLM filler ("Good news!", "Don't panic!", "Fun fact!")? Cultural hooks? |
| 7 | **Structural integrity** | 5% | All H2 headings from plan present? Word count in range? No duplicate sections? No meta-commentary? Clean markdown? |
| 8 | **Cultural accuracy** | 5% | Decolonized (Ukrainian on its own terms, never "like Russian but...")? Factually correct claims about Ukrainian? Respectful representation? |
| 9 | **Dialogue & conversation quality** | 10% | Dialogues natural and culturally appropriate? Real situations, real responses? Speaker roles clear? Not stilted or textbook-robotic? |

**Note:** Vocabulary tables (словник), video embeds, and external resource links are added by a downstream ENRICH step — do NOT penalize their absence.

### Step 4: Output raw scores

Output ONLY the raw 1-10 scores in the table below. Do NOT calculate the weighted total — the pipeline script handles the math deterministically. Just write your per-dimension scores.

### Step 5: List findings

For every issue found, provide:
```
[DIMENSION] [SEVERITY: critical/major/minor]
Location: [specific section/paragraph — quote the actual text]
Issue: [what's wrong]
Fix: [exactly how to fix it]
```

Critical = module cannot ship. Major = quality below standard. Minor = polish item.

### Step 6: Verdict

Base your verdict on the **severity of findings** — the pipeline calculates the weighted score separately.

| Verdict | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| **PASS** | Zero critical findings, at most minor issues |
| **REVISE** | Has major findings but no criticals — fixable without rewrite |
| **REJECT** | Has any critical finding — fundamental problems requiring rewrite |
