# V6 Writing Prompt — Module Content Generation

You are writing one module of a Ukrainian language curriculum for English-speaking teens and adults. Write engaging, pedagogically sound content that teaches the learner to THINK in Ukrainian — not translate from English.

## Your task

Write the full prose content for module **{MODULE_NUM}: {TOPIC_TITLE}** ({LEVEL}, {PHASE}).

**Target: {WORD_TARGET}–{WORD_CEILING} words** of prose (Ukrainian examples count toward word total, headings and exercise placeholders do not).

---

## 6 Hard Rules

1. **NO IPA, NO Latin transliteration** — never write [mɑmɑ], (khlib), or phonetic brackets. Describe sounds by comparison: "Х sounds like «ch» in Scottish «loch»."
2. **NO "In this lesson we will..."** — never use formulaic openers. Start with a dialogue, a question, or a situation.
3. **Ukrainian quotes: «...»** for Ukrainian text. Use regular quotes "..." for English metalanguage (e.g., "like the 'a' in 'father'").
4. **Exercise placeholders** — mark where exercises go using the format below. Write the specific questions, answers, vocabulary, and distractors INSIDE the placeholder block. A downstream tool converts them to interactive components.
5. **NO meta-commentary** — do NOT add "Content notes:", word count summaries, or self-audit sections at the end. Just write the module content and stop.
6. **Hit the word target** — you MUST write {WORD_TARGET}–{WORD_CEILING} words of actual prose. To reach this target, deeply expand explanations, provide 3+ examples per concept, and include rich multi-turn dialogues. Short modules fail review. Never pad with filler.

**Note:** Do NOT add stress marks (´) to any Ukrainian word — a deterministic tool handles this after you write.

## Exercise Placeholder Format

After each key teaching point, write an exercise placeholder. Base your placeholders on the `activity_hints` in the Plan below — each hint should become one placeholder.

Be SPECIFIC — include the actual questions, answers, and distractors. The more detail you provide, the better the exercise.

```
:::exercise-placeholder
type: quiz | fill-in | match-up | group-sort | true-false
tests: [what skill this exercise tests — be specific]
after: [what concept was just taught]
items: [number of items]
vocabulary: [comma-separated Ukrainian words to use as stems]
questions: [specific questions with answers, e.g. "Що ми чуємо? → звуки" or "В=v, Н=n, Р=r"]
groups: [for group-sort: group names and which items go where, e.g. "Голосні: А, О, У; Приголосні: М, К, Б"]
:::
```

**Good example:**
```
:::exercise-placeholder
type: group-sort
tests: classify letters as vowel or consonant
after: голосні vs приголосні explanation
items: 8
groups: Голосні: А, О, У, І; Приголосні: М, К, Б, Ш
:::
```

**Bad example (too vague — the downstream tool cannot generate real content from this):**
```
:::exercise-placeholder
type: quiz
tests: understanding
items: 5
:::
```

Spread placeholders evenly throughout the module. Never cluster them.

### Approved Exercise Patterns

Use these Ukrainian textbook-inspired patterns (Заболотний, Авраменко) instead of generic "quiz" types:

- **Знайди помилку (Find the error):** Give 3 correct sentences and 1 with an error. Learner identifies the mistake. Tests: grammar rules, calques, Russianisms.
- **Обери правильне слово (Choose the right word):** Fill in the blank from 2-3 options (synonyms, paronyms, or confusable words). Tests: vocabulary nuance, register.
- **Утвори пару (Match-up):** Match words to antonyms, translations, or grammatical pairs (e.g., masculine → feminine). Tests: vocabulary, morphology.
- **Розподіли (Group-sort):** Sort items into 2-3 categories (e.g., голосні vs приголосні, hard vs soft consonants). Tests: foundational phonetics, grammar classification.
- **Склади речення (Build a sentence):** Give scrambled words, learner arranges into correct order. Tests: word order, sentence structure.
- **Знайди місце (Find the right place):** Give 4 sentences with blanks and 4 words — each word fits exactly one sentence. Tests: contextual meaning, collocations.

{PLAN_CONTENT}

## Knowledge Packet (textbook excerpts from RAG)

Use these as source material. Cite specific examples and adapt pedagogy from Ukrainian textbooks. Write original prose — do not copy excerpts verbatim.

## Section Structure

Write these sections as H2 headings, in this exact order:

{EXACT_SECTION_TITLES}

Each section should follow the word budget specified. The total must reach {WORD_TARGET} words minimum.

## Content Rules

{IMMERSION_RULE}

{LEVEL_CONSTRAINTS}

### Pedagogy
- Start each section with a real situation or dialogue (PPP: Present → Practice → Produce)
- Every grammar rule needs 3+ Ukrainian examples with English translations
- Teach through PATTERNS, not rules: show examples first, then name the pattern
- Cultural context where relevant — this is Ukrainian, not generic L2
- Use vocabulary from the plan's vocabulary_hints. Function words (pronouns, conjunctions) are always allowed.

### Ukrainian Language Quality
- **Zero Russian**: No ы, э, ё, ъ. No Russian words (кот→кіт, хорошо→добре, конечно→звичайно)
- **Zero Surzhyk**: No шо→що, чо→чому, тіпа→типу
- **Zero calques**: No приймати душ→брати душ, приймати рішення→ухвалювати рішення
- **Zero paronyms**: тактична≠тактовна, ефектний≠ефективний — use the right word, not a similar-sounding one
- **Natural Ukrainian**: Write how a Ukrainian teacher would explain this to a student. Not robotic, not textbook-dry, not overly casual.

### Writing Quality
- Every paragraph: ONE clear point, logical flow to the next
- Vary sentence length (short for emphasis, medium for explanation, long for examples)
- Use callout boxes (:::tip, :::caution, :::note) sparingly — max 3 per module
- Dialogues: natural, not stilted. Real situations, real responses.
- **Tone:** Authoritative but warm. Like a skilled Ukrainian teacher — confident, clear, culturally grounded. Let the content be interesting on its own.
- **Never guess about Ukrainian.** If you are unsure about a word, grammatical form, or phonetic rule — flag it with `<!-- VERIFY: word/claim -->`. Never invent or describe vaguely to hide uncertainty.

### Forbidden Tropes

If you write any of these patterns, the module will be rejected in review:

- **The Cheerleader:** "Great job!", "Don't worry, it's easy!", "You're doing amazing!", "Good news!" — respect the learner's intelligence; stay professional.
- **The Announcer:** "In this section, we will explore...", "Now let's dive into...", "Let's take a look at...", "To summarize what we learned..." — never use formulaic transitions. Just teach the concept directly.
- **The Translator:** "The Ukrainian word for 'cat' is 'кіт'." — instead, present naturally: "A domestic cat is a **кіт**."
- **The Wall of Text:** 3+ paragraphs of English theory without a single Ukrainian example — every concept must be anchored in immediate Ukrainian examples.
- **The Filler:** "This is a very important concept that you will use frequently in your daily life." — empty sentences that add words but not meaning. Every sentence must teach something.

## Output Format

Write in Markdown. Use:
- `## Section Title` for main sections
- `### Subsection` for subsections within a section
- `**bold**` for Ukrainian words being taught
- Tables for paradigms (conjugation, declension)
- `:::tip` / `:::caution` / `:::note` for callout boxes
- `:::exercise-placeholder` for exercise locations (using the key-value format above)

Do NOT write MDX component syntax, YAML frontmatter, or JSON. Plain Markdown with the exercise placeholder blocks described above.
