# Phase 4 Linear Per-Dimension Reviewer Prompt

Review only the assigned dimension. Cite concrete evidence from the generated
content. Return a machine-readable mapping with `score`, `evidence`, and
`verdict` for this one dimension.

Assigned dimension: {DIM}

## Scope — JUDGMENT ONLY, do NOT re-litigate deterministic gates

Deterministic gates already ran before you. Treat their verdicts as ground
truth and do not score them again. The deterministic floor includes
(non-exhaustive): word counts, plan adherence, vesum_verified vocabulary
coverage, textbook grounding, immersion ratios, AI-slop patterns, activity
schema + types + props, formatting standards, `forbidden_words`
(SEVERE_RUSSIANISMS hard list), and `engagement_floor` (callout minimums +
META_NARRATION zero-tolerance ban).

Your job in this LLM dim is the residual judgment that regex cannot make.
For `{DIM}` specifically:

- `engagement`: does the prose actually *hold attention*? The gate already
  confirmed callout count + META_NARRATION absence; you assess whether the
  callouts carry real pedagogy vs filler, whether the tone is warm vs
  bureaucratic, whether direct-address phrases (e.g. `Notice the soft sign
  in **писатися**`) are content-anchored vs generic, whether dialogue feels
  human vs robotic. Score the *quality* of engagement, not its presence —
  presence is the gate's job.
- `pedagogical`: does the sequencing actually teach? Are examples
  illuminating? Does each concept earn the next? The gate confirmed word
  budgets and section presence; you assess whether the pedagogy *works*.
- `naturalness`: does Ukrainian read as native? The gate confirmed VESUM +
  russianism shadow; you assess flow, register, idiom.
- `decolonization`: is the framing Ukrainian-centered? The gate confirmed
  forbidden_words; you assess whether the lesson teaches Ukrainian on its
  own terms vs as "like Russian but...".
- `tone`: is the teacher's voice consistent and warm? The gate caught
  META_NARRATION; you assess everything else about register.

A dim score that re-states what a deterministic gate already enforced is a
reviewer-protocol failure. Cite something the gate cannot see.

## Reasoning checklist (do this BEFORE scoring — #1673)

Before producing the JSON response, reason through this dimension explicitly.
If the model supports extended thinking (Claude, Gemini, GPT-5.5), use it
for these four steps. Skipping this is the "scoring without evidence" failure
mode that non-negotiable rule #6 forbids — every PASS or REVISE that doesn't
trace to verbatim quotes from the content is invalid by definition.

1. **List 3 specific evidence quotes from the Generated Content related to
   `{DIM}`.** Quote them verbatim — character-for-character strings that
   actually appear in `module.md`, `activities.yaml`, `vocabulary.yaml`, or
   `resources.yaml`. Do not invent. Do not paraphrase. Do not summarize.

2. **For each quote, state how it maps to the residual-judgment rubric for
   `{DIM}`** (see scope section above; deterministic checks already ran).
   Is this quote evidence FOR the dimension being satisfied, or evidence
   AGAINST? A quote that just confirms a deterministic-gate criterion is
   not residual evidence — find a different one.

3. **Aggregate the score on the 1-10 scale.** Strongest evidence weighs more
   than weakest. What does the balance tell you? Round to 1 decimal place.

4. **Final verdict.** Score ≥8 → PASS. Score 6-7.99 → REVISE. Score <6 →
   REJECT.

The JSON response MUST include `evidence_quotes` with 3 verbatim quotes from step 1 and `rubric_mapping` explaining how each quote maps to `{DIM}` before the score. The `evidence` field MUST be one of those verbatim quotes, wrapped in escaped quotes. A summary or paraphrase in any evidence field is a reviewer-protocol failure.

## Tier-1 verification audit (do this DURING evidence search — #1661)

Сибір case study (May 2026): an unhardened reviewer let two fabricated
citations and a fused Shevchenko line pass on the writer's first try.
Run this audit on every quote / citation / claim in the Generated Content
that touches dimension `{DIM}`. The audit feeds the evidence list above:
unverified items become FLAG strings in your evidence and weigh the score
down, not silent passes.

A. **Source-attribution audit (all dims).** For every dictionary / style-guide / author cited in the Generated Content, use the single-call primitive `mcp__sources__verify_source_attribution(source, claim)` where `source` ∈ {`grinchenko_1907`, `esum`, `sum11`, `antonenko_davydovych`, `literary`, `heritage`, `wikipedia`, `style_guide`}. Verdict `discusses=false` → FLAG `unverified citation`, treat as score-against. The compose-pattern (calling `search_definitions` / `search_style_guide` / `search_grinchenko_1907` / `query_pravopys` / `search_esum` separately) is acceptable only when you need to inspect specific evidence chunks beyond the boolean verdict; for the audit pass itself, the single-call primitive is mandatory.

B. **Quote verification (all dims).** For every authored quote attributed to a literary source, call `mcp__sources__verify_quote(author, text)`. Required: `matched=true` AND `best_confidence ≥ 0.85`. Verdict false or confidence below threshold → FLAG `fabricated quote`. The tool detects fused composites (two real sources stitched into one attributed line) by returning `matched=false` with non-zero near-misses — flag those as `fused quote`. The compose-pattern (`mcp__sources__search_literary` + grep) is forbidden for this audit; use `verify_quote` exclusively.

C. **Sovietization flag (decolonization, naturalness).** When the content
   draws from `search_definitions` (СУМ-11) for politically loaded
   headwords (`ленін*`, `більшовик*`, `радянськ*`, `соціалістичн*`,
   `партійн*`, `національн*`, `школа`, `шлях`, `прапор`), apply
   heightened scrutiny. The result row's `sovietization_risk` field
   (0/1/2) is ground truth; until it is wired through the writer, fall
   back to the keyword regex above. Soviet framing reproduced into the
   module without paraphrase or correction → FLAG
   `soviet-framed definition unsupervised`.

D. **Modern Ukrainian + heritage-defense audit (naturalness, decolonization).** Flag historical / Old East Slavic / Russian-shadow / pre-Pravopys-2019 forms presented as modern Ukrainian. Also flag the opposite error: authentic Ukrainian archaisms, historisms, or dialectisms mislabeled as Russianism/surzhyk/calque without VESUM/check_modern_form plus historical/etymological/source-context verification. Authentic non-standard forms must carry `[Archaism]`, `[Historism]`, or `[Dialectism]`, a modern standard equivalent, and a brief heritage note. Missing tag/equivalent → FLAG `untagged heritage form`; false Russianism claim → FLAG `heritage form misclassified`.

Reviewers verifying a heritage flag MUST themselves call `mcp__sources__search_heritage` (or `mcp__sources__search_slovnyk_me` for a slovnyk.me-only check) before sustaining or rejecting a heritage claim. A reviewer evidence_quote that asserts heritage status without a tool-grounded citation is a reviewer-protocol failure.
When reviewing a writer heritage claim, verify that slovnyk.me citations use canonical `dictionary_slug` values from `scripts/wiki/slovnyk_me.py` and that merged `search_heritage` citations name `source_family`, `source`, and `classification` when no `dictionary_slug` is present. If the writer cites no raw tool-result excerpt, or if your own `search_heritage` call returns empty, treat the claim as unresolved rather than accepting a heritage or Russianism label.

E. **Reinforce rule #6.** Every claim pairs (i) a verbatim quote from the
   content and (ii) a specific MCP-grounded verification or an explicit
   absence-of-verification flag. A `PASS` with no grounded evidence is a
   reviewer-protocol failure.
